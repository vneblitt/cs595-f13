Where those troops could be sent to help starving people or to disaster victims, basically doing something that helps the people and countries around the world. Basically I oppose the action planned to take on Syria. First of all, I don\u0026#39;t believe we (USA) should be involved in foreign affairs as much as we are, especially in war. We should be focused on helping ourselves first. Priorities do come first! The people of America and our economy should be number one on the list. Its good that we want to help out with the Syrian conflict, but spend the money on us, the economy. So that does lead to one question. How does going into Syria, and possibly starting a mini war crisis like Afghanistan and Iraq, helping the Americans out? The strike on Syria sounds simple but in a long run, might take months and even years to get this situation settled. What is the projected amount of money to be spent on this plan? Remember America is suffering economically!\ufeff",1378816102580,,[]

The World would have let Hitler kill all the Jews had he not tried to take over all of Europe. In Rwanda 500,000-1,000,000 were killed in only 100 days. During the Iraq-Iran war Saddam Hussien used chemical weapons that Western countries supplied, and then he used them on his own people. What did the World do then? This adminstration wants to use military force to supposably punish the Assad regime, yet in truth a strike would merely let Obama sleep a little better at night and serve no other purpose.  \ufeff",1378810608704,,[]

Clearly their people are taking the time to write signs in English asking the U.S.A for intervention. What i wonder is why no one else that is closer, or more stable in their economy trying to help? Is it a fear of Russia? Their is so much deceit in our government anymore how can we trust what they are saying is true? Feels like i heard our leader (Bush) said we needed to intervene in Iraq for chemical weapons... where were they? non existent... which means it was a lie to give fuel for rage. I understand that something needs to be done, but i don\u0026#39;t think that America is the best choice seeing that war has costed us a recession or depression already from our last mistake trusting our corrupt money pocketing Government, with no near end in sight! Wars are funded by the tax payers and the majority are broke and jobless!!!! But knowing how we are (USA), and probably the reason for us getting called terrorists, We are going to go to war... because we have a reputation to uphold no matter how ugly it is. I Don\u0026#39;t think America has ever cared about what the people in it want when it comes to war. We are like mushrooms in a dark room... every once in a while someone opens the door and lets a little light in and feeds us some SHIT.  (these are my opinions)\ufeff",1378810500601,,[]

From my understanding, Syria has the greater fire power so it would make sense to tackle Syria first in hopes of getting Iran involved, and therefore use the situation to \u0026#39;take out\u0026#39; both countries at the same time. Aside from the relatively short term benefits of this (i.e. natural resources and further influence/control in the region) I can see this being a jab at China. Can you ensure the people that the action planned against Syria is not part of a wider plan? Because it sure does seem that way to those of us who keep up to date with global news.\ufeff",1378805828434,,[]

The people of this nation do not,in any way,shape or form, want to do anything that assists Hamas,Hezbollah, the Muslim Brotherhood or worst of all Al Queda, the very people who pissed in our faces on 9/11. Wake up folks. Obama, Kerry and the rest of their ilk are trying to help these very people under the guise of this chemical weapons issue.

We need to leave Syria alone and Obama will possibly start World War III by acting like a jackass as he is currently doing. The evidence against Assad is so scattered and anyone who listens to a US politician saying they have \u0026quot;clear\u0026quot; evidence is a moron. Leave Syria alone. If evidence is presented the UN should evaluate it and report accordingly. Then and only then when the evidence is made available should a proposal be given to Assad to step down by the UN with other countries in agreement. Bombing Syria and killing Assad will send the wrong message and essentially aid the savages/terrorists roaming the streets of Syria killing innocent people. \ufeff",1378800532123,,[]

I don\u0026#39;t care what you have to say, Mr. Kerry, we are not interested in toppling another regime in the Middle East. You are assuming that if the American people had all the facts, and your spin, they would change their minds, and that is not the case. What could you possibly say that would excuse the decades of war for resources and profit? Of lies that cost innocent lives around the world? And for what?? So we can lose our middle class, so we can have our homes foreclosed upon? Fix things at home, earn our respect, then maybe you will have our trust again.\ufeff",1378798606488,,[]

I would want to ask the UN and the international lawyers the following: What is the punishment for non-treatied countries using chemical weapons which cause casualties, regardless of WHO is using? If the guilty party using the chemical weapons are citizens of Syria, then Assad should be held responsible if he does not do additional investigations and arresting himself. Since he “seems” to know that the opposition is to “blame,” then where are the guilty persons? Where are the ”fingerprints?” Where is the evidence? He cannot prove it’s the opposition no more than it can be proven currently that Assad is to blame.  Assad is the leader and should be held responsible legally regardless of where he is pointing the allegations regardless of proof is my main point here. It’s Assad’s responsibility to govern any chemical weapons leaving or entering Syria. Just like it’s his responsibility to sign or not sign a treaty regarding producing, storing or transporting chemical weapons.  What rights do bordering countries have when they are bordered by a country using chemical weapons? Shouldn’t Assad be paying for the refugees stay in other countries? What international laws can be exercised to cite Assad and arrest him since a military strike is clearly not an option? North Korea and Iran need consideration before any military strike is brought upon Syria because of the obvious. What are the international laws for transporting chemical weapons across countries who HAVE signed the treaty? Can charges be brought against those who transported? Can charges be brought against those who sold the weapons?  I\u0026#39;m thinking the more war crime arrests, then the better to diminish the war and determine all players involved as well as the chemical weapon \u0026quot;trail.\u0026quot;  But in summary, I believe this is only bait. And, anyone \u0026quot;striking\u0026quot; against Syria is biting it in a way they would expect. What happens after Assad is taken out via war? Again, I realize his crimes, we all do. But, think and stop reacting to him in a way he would expect. A strike will answer to the chemical weapon offence but it will not alleviate what really is responsible for it. What happens if there is a rebound war in another Mideast area? Then what? Does anyone think that the U.S. would NOT go to the defense of thousands murdered via chemical weapons? Assad knows this. It would be wiser to develop a better strategy for resolving this that will resolve the immediate issue as well as the underlying issues which will affect Americans, other Mideast countries, and other potential victims. Attacking from the \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; will only leave the \u0026quot;left\u0026quot; exposed.\ufeff",1378797770872,,[]

,["","","","Meltem Arikan","Dear Mr Secretary \u003cbr /\u003eThere are two basic issues in Syria: the first is stopping the killings by the Ba’ath regime. The second is the building of a modern Syria that supports peace and tranquility in the wake of that evil. Both can only be realized through intervention by Islamic countries. \u003cbr /\u003eAlthough the US emphasizes that it has no such intention, it will be perceived as an invading power by many groups in the region and will encounter some reaction. Moreover, the limited intervention it would make will not be enough to weaken Assad. On the contrary, it may make him even more aggressive, like a cornered cat. Scores  of groups are active in Syria, with new ones springing up regularly, and it does not seem possible for America to reconcile these and establish “order.”   \u003cbr /\u003eHowever, if Islamic countries act together, this can all easily be established. A battalion of troops can be taken from a large numbers of countries, such as Turkey, Pakistan, Indonesia, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia and, most essentially from Iran, and a kind of Islamic Peace Force can be set up very quickly. It will be easy to put an end to the killing by entering  Syria from 70 different points. This force, supported by the US, the EU and particularly Russia, can  quickly ensure pacification in Syria. \ufeff",1378786862250,,[]

After the Syrian government\u0026#39;s torture of their own people and the death of now more than 300,000, we determined that Syria has crossed the red line by a lot. If the U.S. decides not to take any action against the Syrian government, then how will other countries take us seriously? Obama promised Israel\u0026#39;s security, especially for the past 10 years, from Iran and their development of nuclear weapons. If the US does not take action against Syria, how can Israel have the confidence and security that the U.S. WILL act when it comes time to act with Iran? \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf Assad, being the one who allowed the usage of these chemical weapons, says that he will forfeit the chemical weapons to the UN, how can we trust his word? With his lack of morality, he tortured his own people and killed hundreds of thousands of people, including children. Yet, he still has the guts to deny the usage of chemical weaponsAND threaten the security of the rest of the world? So what makes us so sure that he will be so willing to give up all chemical weapons and not use them again? What makes us so sure that he will not plan a security threat anyways?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGrowing up, we have always been taught to not be bystanders. Afterwards, we have always been encouraged to spread that teaching to those younger than us, to encourage the younger generation not to be bystanders. Now the U.S. is in a position to either act or not. We are bystanders in this Syrian crisis. How will the future generation of the U.S. show concern for those in need if their leaders do not even practice it?  \ufeff",1378765543565,,[]

,["","","","Jason Powe","I believe most reasonable people clearly understand that the Syrian regime used Chemical weapons. The case has been made, and the issue is not in question. Furthermore, I take president Obama at his word that we will not put boots on the ground.  The problem is that few Americans are convinced that such limited strikes as those openly contemplated will matter that much in Assad\u0026#39;s calculus on whether or not to use similar weapons again, even if his capacity is degraded. Worst of all, even if the strikes do in fact curtail the weapon\u0026#39;s future use as you predict, according to our own stated intent, they will have virtually no effect in stopping the Syrian civil war and no effect on Assad personally, leaving countless more to die in in equally horrific if less proscribed ways.  My main question for secretary Kerry is: How can you ask us to care how people die, but not \u0026quot;if\u0026quot; they die, or even how many die? How can you ask us to punish the weapon, but not the one who wields it? For those children who are killed by choking on their own breadth are just as dead as those children riddled with bullet holes. Their parents undoubtedly grieve just as much.  \u003cbr /\u003eBoth sides in the war also have clearly engaged in atrocities. Neither side is a compelling, predictable, future US partner. Neither our national security, nor that of our Allies is truly at stake. Israel has made it clear they can handle themselves. For those of us who want to support Obama, and believe the use of chemical weapons is a special case worthy not just condemnation and sanctions but War (if a blockade is an act war dropping bombs is certainly an act of war too), you must persuade us that our attack is not about national prestige or pride or a random perfunctory red line; or, even preserving international norms. Those are horrible reasons to go to war... furthermore, we do not want to be the world police (there already is an international body for that and the rest of the international community is not flocking to our side. Those that are, are apparently doing so halfheartedly and not willing to do the deed themselves).... The worst argument, which I hope Secretary Kerry will not make,  is that we must go to war in Syria so Iran will take us seriously. The secretary is well served not mentioning Iran.  If you want Iran to take us seriously about force, bombing Syria is a horribly circuitous neoconservative way to go about it.  Why not just force a vote to authorize the president\u0026#39;s discretionary use of force against Iran instead? Not that I\u0026#39;m advocating that course, but they would certainly take it more seriously than a few tomahawks lobbed at Damascus.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhat I can not get my head around is if Assad remains in power after hostilities end (the administration is offering no guarantee this will not be the case), after we have killed some nameless Syrian pilots and artillery crews, what kind of message does that send? Kill children with gas and we will take some of your tanks and bombs away,  a slap on the wrist and muffled, \u0026quot;shame on you!\u0026quot; That seems like a hopelessly unsatisfactory yet entirely plausible outcome given the president\u0026#39;s scope of force. It begs the question, if you are going to act, act fully, if not, why bother?\ufeff",1378755914546,,[]

Right now I\u0026#39;m having to use evernote to compose this msg for the same reasons.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHowever I do feel it is necessary to highlight some questions to ask, and some tips/tricks to be aware of.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTips and tricks:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e1) Kerry is likely to try to divert attention from the questions asked if they are not on topic or liable to get him in trouble.  It is important to POLITELY highlight this as and when it occurs.  Politicians are brilliant at this tactic as a rule, and the only way to drive the enquiry is to keep reiterating it until it is answered.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e2) Expect logical fallacies like strawman arguments and appeals to emotion to be used and try to identify them as they occur.  A good site for this is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/home\" class\u003d\"ot-anchor\" rel\u003d\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/home\u003c/a\u003e as it provides a fairly complete list with examples.  Study it today, and be ready to call his \u0026#39;logic\u0026#39; out if they occur.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e3) do not be offensive or aggressive in the questioning - it only makes us look like we are weak on our points when anger creeps in.  Be civil, direct, and polite to move it forward.  Do not call him corrupt or an idiot, as he will probably end the interview if he gets abuse throw at him.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e4) Do not under any circumstances try to compare what is happening to thee Nazis or let it descend into comparisons to Germany in WWII.  This is now classically thought of as the point where an online debate / argument dies and the side that brings it up is the one that loses. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e5) when completed, share it around - we all want to know WTF is going on and why the us government is so adamant to get involved.  I suspect it will fall along the lines of \u0026#39;chemical weapons are bad, m\u0026#39;kay?\u0026#39; This leads me onto the questions which I feel are potentially the better ones to ask\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eQuestions:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e1) the us government has argued this isn\u0026#39;t about regime change, but our objective is to remove Assad from power in some way shape or form.  First how do reconcile these statements and what is the plan of action around establishing a new government that is not influenced by external rebel forces?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e2) the rebel groups involved are not all associated with being Syrian in origin - the more effective groups include Al Nusra Front, a known terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda.  We know Hezbollah is linked to Assad, as per the us government position on this matter, but given we are supporting the factions that are linked to a terror and associated with those responsible for 9/11, how can we guarantee that these elements will not gain control of the country, or justify supporting them in the first place?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e3) we are claiming this is about chemical weapons, and yet we used depleted uranium in Iraq which has genetically damaged the people of that country, and will continue to do so for years to come (possibly longer than the earth will exist unless action is taken).  We also did nothing to stop Saddam gassing Iranians and thousands of Kurds, Israel from using white phosphorous, and have done little to repair the damage we did with agent orange in Vietnam.  Please explain how this time it is different when all of these other devastating chemical weapons were not prevented or sanctioned (omit/ammend details as need be as I\u0026#39;m not sure about if there were sanctions made over this)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e4) as it is known Assad has chemweps, what guarantees they will not fall into the hands of Al Nusra Front if/when Assad is removed?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e5) explain the usage of false images to drum up a response in favour of this strike specifically those denounced by the photographers and shown by organisations like (but not limited to) the BBC.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e6) will the \u0026#39;evidence\u0026#39; the us has gathered be made available to the public?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e7) given sarin was found in the soil two years after Saddam used it in Iraq during the Iran / Iraq war, why is it that the UN report on this issue is redundant?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e8) what independent sources can verify the claims by the us, French and uk governments that chemical weapons were used and who used them on august 21st?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e9) if support in congress does not exist and an AUMF is not authorised, can Obama still use military force in Syria and under what authority ( i suspect he will claim the war powers act, but from my own reading it does not allow bypassing congress unless us territories or sovereignty is threatened.

,["","","","Hank Lacey","One of the most weighty concerns I have about the situation in Syria is the possible response of Iran and North Korea to this situation. If the U.S. is perceived as being unwilling to defend international law as it relates to use of weapons of mass destruction, then it seems logical to conclude that there is a risk other nations will be more likely to build and use them. I know that the risks posed by failing to deter WMD use can\u0026#39;t be quantified. What information does the U.S. have (and which can be discussed here) that can help the public understand any likelihood that North Korea, Iran, and others will build or use weapons forbidden by international law if Bashar al-Assad\u0026#39;s behavior is not met with a response? Thank you.\ufeff",1378746589004,,[]

,["","","","Emma Scott","Dear Secretary Kerry. Q1. Does the administration think that Syrian regime elements/fragments will or will not retaliate against Israel, and, why do you think that? Q2. Has the administration considered what actions the jihadis are taking, which allows them to gain a sphere of influence in Syria, and what are the administration\u0026#39;s counter-actions? Q3. Is the administration aware of the position of ex-French foreign Minister, Dominique de Villepin, who explains that a power tactic is not suitable today because power at the global level is changing hands, therefore its necessary to have vision?  Q4. What is your vision for Syria itself or through Syria for the wider region? Q5. Has the administration considered a \u0026quot;containment strategy\u0026quot; towards the conflict, and what actions would such a strategy entail? Other than military action against Syria internally, has the administration considered US grounds troops inside the Turkish border in cooperation of course with the Turkish armed forces and the Kurds to strengthen the border, hence contain the spillover? Q6. Who is the administration\u0026#39;s number 1. enemy, the Jihadi\u0026#39;s  or the Assad regime? Q8. Does the administration not think that fighting the jihadi\u0026#39;s would actually strengthen the hand of the rebels in their fight against the Assad regime? Q7. What peaceful political actors/non-warring political actors has the administration identified inside Syria, and what is the administration doing to support these actors and their actions? Yours respectfully, Emma Scott. A postgraduate student of geopolitics.\ufeff",1378744317946,,[]

Military intervention to Syria is not reasonable, this would only cause even more pain. If US forces strike Syria, there might be civilians around, and that is very risky. There will be loss of life in vain. That is a very difficult undertaking. And it would have no effect on Al-Assad as he is already destroying his country and his people himself anyway.\u003cbr /\u003eAmerica bombing the country would only cause even more pain. That’s not a correct method. It should be a rescue operation not a war. \u003cbr /\u003eMuslim countries should enter into Syria from 70 separate points with an army that could be built up with a number of divisions from every country. This would make Al-Assad step back instantly because no force can give a battle in 70 different fronts. And furthermore there will be more bloodshed since this unit will act as police force and solve the problem in Syria.\u003cbr /\u003eThese soldiers will enter Syria to rescue them, not to have a war with them.

He is the leader of a sovereign nation and has the right to fight back. That\u0026#39;s question one. Question two is along the lines of intel. How are we so sure that he gassed his own people? Because Israel said so? Given that Israel hates Syria, why are we taking their word for it. Assad is saying otherwise, shouldn\u0026#39;t we also listen to him? We should wait for the UN to finish their job over there and come to a conclusion based on independent findings. And number three, sir, when you ran for President you chastised the Bush Administration for invading Iraq. It turns out the evidence is false. Are you going to learn from those mistakes and let them handle their own issues, or go down the same road killing civilians in order to stop something else?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThank you for your time. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e \u003ca class\u003d\"ot-hashtag\" href\u003d\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23TalkSyria\"\u003e#TalkSyria\u003c/a\u003e  \ufeff",1378726566410,,[]

Why haven\u0026#39;t we learned anything of all the conflicts and massacres in the past? Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, etc...Rwanda probably was the biggest tragedy of history but still, when a massacre takes place, when there are major violations of human righs, war crimes etc...The world still doesn\u0026#39;t act!!

America\u0026#39;s own civil war (which served a noble purpose) having its own set of atrocities would not view outside influences very amiably. This is coming from reasonable peoples. Assad is not reasonable, so why would only U.S. intervention prevent a fractured anarchy type of control in Syria if left alone? INTERNATIONAL intervention needs to take place as a group effort to remove chemical weapons and Assad and set up an interim governmental system. Unless, the international community has given the U.S. the job to do this and no one is aware of this. If the U.S. can “convince” Assad to \u0026quot;turn in\u0026quot; all chemical weapons, then the U.S. can convince the necessity of the international community to get involved as a group effort to bring justice. And, this goes for ALL of the Mideast atrocities...not just Syria. This type of leadership and behavior in the Mideast is common. Pressure needs to come from the U.S. to be placed on the international community and Americans need to be informed of the stance that the International community wishes to take and hear it from their leaders\u0026#39; mouths. I am sure that the U.S. is not the only country who cares about the victims in Syria and in the Mideast. For now, the U.S. needs to increase aid and protection to the victims and focus on that effort to prevent the effects of anymore atrocities. U.S. should focus on excavation plans/assistance, help and shelter needs to be set up for refugees in order to deal with Assad internationally while his targets are as safe as possible until an interim government can be installed. Syrian politics, regime, prospective plans, military actions, civil war outcomes, chemical weapons responses should be an INTERNATIONAL group effort not just the U.S.  And, I would question why the international community would allow only one country to be afforded this responsibility outside ICC approval.",1378846793000,"z12xzxpqsxjrtbkqu04cfrhyltalenfix5k#1378846792678489",,"110211418431935072367","z12xzxpqsxjrtbkqu04cfrhyltalenfix5k",0,0,,0,0,,,[,,,,,,,,,,,,[]

America\u0026#39;s own civil war (which served a noble purpose) having its own set of atrocities would not view outside influences very amiably. This is coming from reasonable peoples. Assad is not reasonable, so why would only U.S. intervention prevent a fractured anarchy type of control in Syria if left alone? INTERNATIONAL intervention needs to take place as a group effort to remove chemical weapons and Assad and set up an interim governmental system. Unless, the international community has given the U.S. the job to do this and no one is aware of this. If the U.S. can “convince” Assad to \u0026quot;turn in\u0026quot; all chemical weapons, then the U.S. can convince the necessity of the international community to get involved as a group effort to bring justice. And, this goes for ALL of the Mideast atrocities...not just Syria. This type of leadership and behavior in the Mideast is common. Pressure needs to come from the U.S. to be placed on the international community and Americans need to be informed of the stance that the International community wishes to take and hear it from their leaders\u0026#39; mouths. I am sure that the U.S. is not the only country who cares about the victims in Syria and in the Mideast. For now, the U.S. needs to increase aid and protection to the victims and focus on that effort to prevent the effects of anymore atrocities. U.S. should focus on excavation plans/assistance, help and shelter needs to be set up for refugees in order to deal with Assad internationally while his targets are as safe as possible until an interim government can be installed. Syrian politics, regime, prospective plans, military actions, civil war outcomes, chemical weapons responses should be an INTERNATIONAL group effort not just the U.S.  And, I would question why the international community would allow only one country to be afforded this responsibility outside ICC approval.",1378846703000,"z12gdxehbwbruxpl522ktn1wmxuewp3ra04#1378846702964069",,"110211418431935072367","z12gdxehbwbruxpl522ktn1wmxuewp3ra04",0,0,,0,0,,,[,,,,,,,,,,,,[]

Looking forward to the hangout this afternoon!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e1.\tHow will an invasion or strike on Syria impact the economy both here and in Syria? (Ethan S.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e2.\tDo you think more or less lives will be lost if the US invades Syria? (Henry B.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e3.\tDo you think that military action would culminate in democracy and equity in Syria?  Why or why not? (Grant M.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e4.\tDo you believe that the rebels are fighting mainly for democracy and equity or are there some among them that may replace Bashar al-Assad with another dictator? (Grant M.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e5.\tWhat would you think we should do if we discovered that the chemical weapons were also being used by the rebels, or only being used by the rebels? (Grant M.) \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e6.\tWould a strike or invasion end up like Iraq – our last attempt to “create” democracy in the Middle East? (Jared L.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e7.\tWhat are your predictions of what would happen if the Assad stays in power?  Or if the rebels take over the Syrian government?

If so, what type of retaliation are we prepared for?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e13.\tAn attack on Syria could affect our relations with other countries in the region, are the possible ramifications of that change in relations justified?
