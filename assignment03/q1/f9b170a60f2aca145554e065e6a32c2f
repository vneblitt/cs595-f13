			 Packard Campus Back-to-School Month Features Live and Cinematic Performances</h3>
		   
			
		   
		   
		   <p>Washington D.C.-area stand-up comics Mike Diesel and Mark Matusof will bring their comedy stylings to the Library of Congress Packard Campus theater in Culpeper, Va., on Sept. 14.  The program will also feature a presentation about important comedy records named to the National Recording Registry by stand-up comedy expert Dan Blazek, who works in the Library’s Recorded Sound Section.  This will be the second live performance held in the Library’s state-of-the-art theater. </p>
<p>A double bill of "Picture Snatcher," starring James Cagney, and "The Little Giant," starring Edward G. Robinson, will open the September film screenings. Part of the year-long series showcasing films from 1933, both films will be shown in new 35 mm prints produced by the Library of Congress Film Preservation Laboratory. </p>
<p>A "Back to School" series of features celebrating the annual return to academia will include the National Film Registry silent comedy "The Freshman," starring Harold Lloyd—with live musical accompaniment by Andrew Simpson—as well as the Academy Award-nominated "Goodbye, Mr. Chips." "I Know it’s Only Rock ŉ’ Roll" is the theme for screenings of rock-ŉ’- roll concert documentaries, including Talking Heads’ "Stop Making Sense," plus an evening of the popular musical genre on television, selected from the Library’s vast video collections housed at the Packard Campus.</p>
<p><p>Screenings are preceded by an informative slide presentation about each film, with music selected by the Library’s Recorded Sound Section. Short subjects will be presented before select programs. Titles are subject to change without notice.</p></p>
<p><p>All Packard Campus programs are free and open to the public, but children 12 and under must be accompanied by an adult. For reservation information call (540) 827-1079 ext. 79994 or (202) 707-9994 during business hours, beginning one week before any given screening. Reservations will be held until 10 minutes before showtime. In case of inclement weather, call the theater reservation line no more than three hours before showtime to confirm cancellations.  The theater will be closed July 4-6.  For further information on the theater and film series, visit <a href="http://www.loc.gov/avconservation/theater/">www.loc.gov/avconservation/theater/</a>. </p></p>
<p><p>The Library of Congress Packard Campus for Audio Visual Conservation is a state-of-the-art facility funded as a gift to the nation by the Packard Humanities Institute. The Packard Campus is the site where the nation’s library acquires, preserves and provides access to the world’s largest and most comprehensive collection of motion pictures, television programs, radio broadcasts and sound recordings (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/avconservation/">www.loc.gov/avconservation/</a>). The Packard Campus is home to nearly 7 million collection items. It provides staff support for the Library of Congress National Film Preservation Board, the National Recording Preservation Board and the national registries for film and recorded sound.</p></p>
<p><p>Founded in 1800, the Library of Congress is the nation’s oldest federal cultural institution. It seeks to spark imagination and creativity and to further human understanding and wisdom by providing access to knowledge through its magnificent collections, programs and exhibitions. Many of the Library’s rich resources can be accessed through its website at <a href="http://www.loc.gov">www.loc.gov</a>.<h2>Series Schedule</h2><strong>Thursday, Sept. 5 (7:30 p.m.)<br />1933 DOUBLE FEATURE<br />"Picture Snatcher</strong>" (Warner Bros., 1933)<br />James Cagney stars as Danny Kean, a brash Lower East Side ex-con who decides to go legit. He finds his criminal skills perfectly suited to the barely legal antics of a sleazy tabloid newspaper where he becomes the ace "picture snatcher." Lloyd Bacon directed the snappy crime-drama, which was reportedly inspired by newspaperman-turned-screenwriter Ben Hecht’s early career. The Library of Congress Packard Campus Film Preservation Laboratory made the new screening print.</p>
<p><strong>"The Little Giant</strong>" (First National, 1933)<br />Edward G. Robinson spoofs his own gangster persona in this comedy, directed by Roy Del Ruth, in which he plays a bootlegger who tries to break into high society after Prohibition ends. Mary Astor provides the classy love interest in this lightning-paced send-up of gangster movies.  The Library of Congress Packard Campus film preservation lab developed the new screening print.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, Sept. 6 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"School of Rock</strong>" (Paramount, 2003)<br />Fired from his band and hard up for cash, rock guitarist and vocalist Dewey Finn (Jack Black) wangles his way into a job as a fourth-grade substitute teacher at a private school. Soon, his free-living lifestyle influences the students to explore sides of themselves that the school doesn’t encourage. Joan Cusack and Sarah Silverman co-star in this critically acclaimed comedy, directed by Richard Linklater.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Sept. 7 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"Stop Making Sense</strong>" (Cinecom, 1984)<br />Director Jonathan Demme expertly crafted this unrivaled concert film from footage of three live gigs at Hollywood’s Pantages Theatre. The staging concept—the brainchild of Talking Heads front man David Byrne—begins with the lead vocalist striding onto an empty stage, acoustic guitar and boom box in hand. With each new tune, another band member or backup singer joins Byrne onstage, building steadily toward the finale. </p>
<p><strong>Thursday, Sept. 12 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"Music to Look At: An Evening of Music Videos</strong>" (1980s)<br />Selections of iconic music videos reaching from the early days of MTV to the recent past will highlight the video form’s most memorable, influential, innovative and, at times, controversial examples, with a special emphasis on resonating images, themes and affectionate nostalgia.  Featured, among others, will be videos by Madonna, Devo, Duran Duran, Talking Heads, REM, Lady Gaga and Nirvana, whose 1991 album "Nevermind" was added to the National Recording Registry in 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, Sept. 13 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"Stand and Deliver</strong>" (Warner Bros., 1988)<br />East Los Angeles math teacher Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos) finds himself in a classroom of rebellious remedial students. Escalante stuns fellow faculty members with his plans to teach the kids advanced placement calculus. However, no one expects the mostly Hispanic teens (including Lou Diamond Phillips) to overcome the odds. Ramón Menéndez directed this moving, mostly true story.  "Stand and Deliver" was named to the National Film Registry in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Sept. 14 (2 p.m.)<br />"The Indian in the Cupboard</strong>" (Columbia, 1995)<br />A boy receives an old cupboard as a birthday present and finds that when he puts a plastic Indian inside and turns the key, the Indian comes to life. He learns that the Indian is not a toy, but a real person.  Complications arise, especially when his best friend conjures up a real-life cowboy. Frank Oz directed this family sci-fi fantasy that stars Hal Scardino, Lightfoot, Lindsay Crouse and Richard Jenkins. </p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Sept. 14 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"Mike and Mark at the Mike: Celebrating Comedy on the National Recording Registry</strong>" (Live)<br />Popular standup comedians Mike Diesel and Mark Matusof will appear in a live performance on the Packard Campus stage.  Cary O'Dell, National Recording Registry Board assistant and TV historian, will host the evening.  The program will also feature a presentation by stand-up comedy expert Dan Blazek about comedy recordings selected for the National Recording Registry.  </p>
<p><strong>Thursday, Sept. 19 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"High School Confidential</strong>" (MGM, 1958)<br />Director Jack Arnold explores the influence of drugs and rock ‘n’ roll on young minds in this campy classic that centers on the escapades of tough-talking teen Tony Baker (Russ Tamblyn), who quickly works his way into the dope scene of his new high school. The cast of this entertaining morality tale includes Jackie Coogan, John Drew Barrymore, Mamie Van Doren and Jerry Lee Lewis as himself. </p>
<p><strong>Friday, Sept. 20 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"Urgh! A Music War</strong>" (Filmways, 1981 – R-rated*)<br />A series of live performances by punk rock, New Wave, and post-punk acts filmed in 1980 features artists Magazine, The Go-Go's, The Fleshtones, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, XTC, Devo, The Cramps, Oingo Boingo, Dead Kennedys, Gary Numan, Klaus Nomi, Wall of Voodoo, Pere Ubu, Steel Pulse, Surf Punks, 999, UB40, Echo & the Bunnymen and The Police.<br /><i>* No one under the age of 17 will be admitted without a parent or guardian.</i></p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Sept. 21 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"The Freshman</strong>" (Pathé, 1925)<br />One of silent-film comedian Harold Lloyd’s best-remembered features casts him as a collegiate patsy who will do anything to be popular on campus, unaware that everyone is making fun of him. The football game finale is one of several comic highlights. Directed by Sam Taylor, the film was added to the National Film Registry in 1990. Andrew Simpson will provide live musical accompaniment. </p>
<p><strong>Thursday, Sept. 26 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"Up the Down Staircase</strong>" (Warner Bros., 1967)<br />Sandy Dennis stars as Sylvia Barrett, an inexperienced but idealistic young teacher who takes a job at a tough inner-city high school. Troubled by the apathy of both her students and fellow teachers, Barrett revels in her few successes. However, her naïveté may prove a fatal flaw despite her good intentions. Eileen Heckart, Jean Stapleton and Patrick Bedford co-star in director Robert Mulligan’s adaptation of Bel Kaufman’s novel. </p>
<p><strong>Friday, Sept. 27 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"I Saw It on T.V.:  Rock ŉ’ Roll in Your Living Room</strong>" (1960-1990)<br />An evening of rock ŉ’ roll on television will feature clips from "The Ed Sullivan Show," "Hollywood Palace," "Shindig," "The Beat," "The Tonight Show," "The Dick Cavett Show," "Saturday Night Live" and "Late Night with David Letterman."  Performers include Elvis Presley, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Sept. 28 (7:30 p.m.)<br />"Goodbye, Mr. Chips</strong>" (MGM, 1939)<br />Robert Donat won an Oscar for his memorable portrayal of a shy schoolmaster who devotes his life to "his boys," only coming out of his shell when he meets and falls in love with a feisty, young English suffragette. Sam Wood directed this adaptation of James Hilton’s novel. Greer Garson’s film debut made her a major star.</p>
