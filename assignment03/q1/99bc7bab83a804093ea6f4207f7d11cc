<div class="date">Tuesday, <span class="month">JUNE 25</span> at 12:00 noon <em>(no tickets required)</em></div>
<p>The An-sky Yiddish Heritage Ensemble -- renowned Yiddish  folk singers Michael Alpert and Ethel Raim, tsimblist (hammered dulcimer  player) Pete Rushefsky and violinist Jake Shulman-Ment -- celebrates the  hundredth Anniversary of the historic An-sky Expedition. This 1911-1914  ethographic expedition systematically documented the Jewish folk culture of  dozens of communities in Ukraine  and White Russia. &nbsp;It is named for its  leader, Yiddish writer and folklorist Semyon An-sky, pen name of Shloyme Zaynvl  Rapoport (1863-1920), who is best known as the author of the groundbreaking  play <em>The Dybbuk</em>.&nbsp; The An-sky materials, located at the Russian Museum  of Ethnography in St. Petersburg,  stand as an unparalleled record of a lost, preindustrial Jewish society that  was carried out in the Yiddish language. Inspired by An-sky&rsquo;s work, and  affiliated with the New York-based Center for Traditional Music and Dance (<a href="http://www.ctmd.org">www.ctmd.org </a><img src="http://www.loc.gov/images/externallink.gif" alt="External link" width="12" height="10">), the An-sky Yiddish Heritage  Ensemble is a supergroup of four leading performers and researchers of Yiddish  music who present a diverse program of rare Yiddish folksongs and exciting  klezmer instrumentals collected through field and archival research. The  ensemble also performs original music rooted in the tradition, and in doing so  keeps the flame of Yiddish culture alive. <em>Photo by Janina Wurbs.</em></p>

<div class="date">Tuesday, <span class="month">JULY 2</span> at 12:00 noon <em>(no tickets required)</em></div>
<p>Libaya Baba means  &quot;Grandfather&rsquo;s Grandchildren.&quot; The group consists of three brothers  Jeffrey, Kelsie, and Dayton Bernardez, and their cousin, Greg Palacio.&nbsp; Their first influence came from their  grandfather, Cyril Antonio, and other master drummers of Dangriga, Belize.  After migrating to Los Angeles, California, in the late 1970s, they felt the need to  preserve their indigenous Garifuna culture, which has both Caribbean  and West African elements. Libaya Baba has retained the traditional format of  call and response in songs,&nbsp;to uphold&nbsp;the memory of their ancestors.  Their music is accompanied by a pair of Sisira (maracas), one Primero (small  wooden snare drum), two Segundas (mid size &amp; large wooden bass drums) Conch  and Turtle shells. The genres of music they play include H&uuml;ng&uuml;-h&uuml;ng&uuml;, Paranda,  Punta, Kuli&oacute;u, Wanaragua, Hupi Malad, Warini, Gunj&eacute;i, &ldquo;Two for Shilling,&rdquo;  Chumba and Ch&aacute;rikan&aacute;ri. They have intrigued audiences throughout the U.S.<a name="jul11" id="jun2"></a></p>

<div class="date">Thursday, <span class="month">JULY 11</span> at 12:00 noon <em>(no tickets required)</em></div>
<p>Harmonia  presents traditional folk music of Eastern Europe, ranging from the Danube to the Carpathians. Its repertoire reflects the  cultures of this region: Hungarian, Slovak, Ukrainian, Romanian, Croatian and  Gypsy. Performed on authentic folk instruments, and styled after turn-of-the-century  eastern-European Gypsy bands, their music is drawn from both the urban and  rural traditions of eastern Europe. The musicians come from varied eastern-European  backgrounds; in Harmonia they have found a common musical language. In addition  to being polished performers on instruments as varied as accordion, upright  bass, violin, pan-flute, and cimbalom (hammered dulcimer), Harmonia&rsquo;s members  are adept at explaining their music and culture to diverse audiences.  Harmonia brings to the concert  stage the vitality and excitement of ethnic weddings, celebrations, and smoky  caf&eacute;s that inspired composers such as Bartok, Brahms and Liszt.<a name="aug07" id="jun3"></a></p>

<p>Hailing from Covington, Kentucky and Cincinnati,   Ohio, the Brotherhood Singers  (formerly The Northern Kentucky Brotherhood Singers) are among the very few  remaining gospel quartet-style groups that still perform in the old-school a  cappella fashion. The Singers specialize in the intricate and emotional  four-part harmony &quot;jubilee&quot; style pioneered by such legendary groups  as the Dixie Hummingbirds, The Golden Gate Quartet, the Soul Stirrers and The  Harptones of Cincinnati. The Brotherhood Singers started singing at the 9th Street Baptist  Church in Covington.  The group has performed in churches, secular music venues and television spots  throughout the U.S., as well  as in Canada and Spain,  which they have toured 17 times. In April 2012, they toured Russia as part of the first &ldquo;Festival of  Traditional American Music,&rdquo; a joint project of AFC, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, and CEC ArtsLink.  They sing primarily Gospel but have recently added patriotic songs and  feel-good R&amp;B to their repertoire.<a name="aug14" id="jun4"></a></p>

<div class="date">Wednesday, <span class="month">AUGUST 14</span> at 12:00 noon <em>(no tickets required)</em></div>
<p>Kalanidhi Dance Company was founded in 2005. Its artistic  approach is to explore creative and contemporary ideas through the vocabulary  of Kuchipudi, while retaining the essence and integrity of the classical form.  Kuchipudi, one of India's seven main classical dance styles, combines fast  rhythms with fluid movements, creating a blend of control and abandon, strength  and delicacy. Expressive facial techniques and subtle body movements serve as  the cornerstone of Kuchipudi and document and preserve the centuries-old body  language of Andhra Pradesh women. Trained in the rigors of the Vempati style,  the Kalanidhi Dance Company very quickly gained a reputation for producing new  and original choreography that has been praised by Indian and American dance  critics. An important part of the company&rsquo;s mission is to promote dialogue in  the arts and to nourish creativity through interaction with artists of other  styles and genres.&nbsp; Kalanidhi Dance toured India in October 2007 to  participate alongside some of India&rsquo;s best dance troupes in the Ananya  festival, one of India&rsquo;s most prestigious dance festivals.&nbsp; Kalanidhi  Dance was also presented at India&rsquo;s premier classical dance institution,  Kalakshetra in Chennai. <a name="sep11" id="jun5"></a></p>

<p>Los Texmaniacs mix the simplest yet finest ingredients of Texas music to create a sound solidly rooted in tradition, exploding with contemporary vitality. Their versatility has led them to perform at The Smithsonian Folklife Festival, The International Accordion Festival, The Kennedy Center, The Governor of Texas Ball, and many major festivals overseas in countries such as Germany, Holland, and Spain.  Founder Max Baca is a renowned innovator on the bajo sexto, a twelve string guitar-like instrument, which customarily provides rhythm accompaniment for the button accordion, creating the core of the Texas conjunto sound. Los Texmaniacs is a product of Baca&rsquo;s wide-ranging experience touring and recording with his father's family conjunto, Flaco Jimenenz, the original Texas Tornados, Los Super Seven, and even the Rolling Stones. His travels have included tours to Iraq, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Kosovo to entertain American troops. He has appeared on national television programs such as Conan O' Brien, David Letterman, Jay Leno, and Austin City Limits, and has been featured in several documentaries, including Songs of the Homeland, American Roots Music, and Latin Music USA. Max has participated on ten Grammy-winning projects, including the double-platinum CD for the Rolling Stones Voodoo Lounge. In 2009 Los TexManiacs won a Grammy Award for their album Borders Y Bailes, released on Smithsonian Folkways.<a name="sep21" id="jun6"></a></p>

<p>This concert celebrates Flory Jagoda&rsquo;s  internationally recognized career as singer, composer, and teacher of Sephardic  song, and will honor her role as &ldquo;keeper of the flame&rdquo; for preserving,  perpetuating, and expanding this venerable Jewish cultural tradition. Family  members and musical colleagues and from the Washington, D.C., area and beyond  will join Jagoda to perform the songs that she has taught them in her quest to  transmit her family&rsquo;s musical heritage and keep it vibrantly alive. A 2002  recipient of a National Heritage Fellowship, presented by the National  Endowment for the Arts, Jagoda later served as a Master Artist in the Folklife  Apprenticeship Program for the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities. Born in Sarajevo, Bosnia,  in 1923, Flory Jagoda learned many songs from her Nona (grandmother) and other  family members, who were known as the &ldquo;Singing Altara&#269;s.&rdquo; Her original  compositions and arrangements have been performed and recorded by singers and  groups in the U.S. and Europe and many are now firmly entrenched in Sephardic song  tradition.

<div class="date">Thursday, <span class="month">JUNE 21</span> at 12:00 noon <em>(no tickets required)</em></div>
<p>Dennis  Stroughmatt, born and raised in southeastern Illinois, is an authority on  French Creole music and culture of &ldquo;Upper Louisiana,&rdquo; aka Illinois, Missouri,  and Indiana, which came to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase.  By an amazing string of chance events, young Dennis Stroughmatt came upon the  descendants of French Midwestern settlers, and he spent over three years in  southeast Missouri  learning to speak Illinois French Creole, play the fiddle, and sing many of the  traditional songs that have thrived in the region for over three hundred years.  He would also go on to live, work and play music in the &ldquo;Cajun country&rdquo; of Louisiana, and to study in Quebec,  thus completing the circle of French culture in North   America. With the blessing of the Creole people of the Midwest,  Dennis Stroughmatt et l&rsquo;Espirit Creole are its passionate ambassadors,  expanding interest and excitement in a region that has been, in many ways,  ignored by the history books. As a result, the French music, language, stories,  and culture once hidden away in the Missouri Ozarks now has a voice in the  wider world.&nbsp; As they say in the hills:  &ldquo;On est toujours icitte: We are still here!&rdquo;  <strong>Learn more:</strong> <a href="http://www.creolefiddle.com">www.creolefiddle.com</a> <img src="http://www.loc.gov/images/externallink.gif" alt="External link" width="12" height="10"> <a name="jun26"></a></p>

<p><strong>Unukupukupu</strong> is  the traditional H&#257;lau Hula (Hula School) of <a href="http://www.hawaii.hawaii.edu/hls/hula/"> Hawai`i Community College, Hilo, Hawai`i</a>  <img src="http://www.loc.gov/images/externallink.gif" alt="External link" width="12" height="10">.  &nbsp;Here ancient dances and songs, rooted in  the sacred `Aiha`a Pele (Ritual Dance of Volcanic Phenomena) intermingle with  the rigor of academic inquiry. To experience the particular fiery style of hula  termed `Aiha`a Pele, one is trained to call up the fire within the body and to  dance until sweat shines at the temples and forehead. Under the cultural and  academic stewardship of Dr. Taup&#333;uri Tangar&#333;to, Unukupukupu is a community of  traditional dancers functionally aware that Hula is one of the world&rsquo;s sacred dances  of environmental kinship and global connections. <a name="jul18"></a></p>

<p><strong>Ru&#382;e Dalmatinke</strong>, from Seattle, Washington. Deep passion and  intense devotion to Croatian musical heritage have kept the group active since  1981, and have inspired the group's lead vocalists, sisters Binki and Alma,  since childhood. Binki Franulovic Spahi (lead voice) and Alma Franulovic  Plancich (second voice) lead Ruze Dalmatinke in singing, and are responsible  for the group's adherence to traditional purity in their music. 
From the town of Vela Luka on the island of Korcula, Dalmatia, Croatia, they  immigrated with their family to the United States after World War II. Having  sung together since childhood, the sisters brought with them their lifestyle of  singing, as well as an oral tradition generations old. Their voices are  accompanied by instrumentation, adding to the vocal harmonies. The band  members, also vocalists, along with Binki and Alma, perform music from the many  different regions of Croatia - from the tranquil Dalmatian ballads to the  strident melodies of the interior. <a name="aug08"></a></p>

  <em>French-Canadian Fiddle Music &amp; Songs from New Hampshire</em></div>
<div class="date">Wednesday, <span class="month">AUGUST 8</span> at 12:00 noon <em>(no tickets required)</em></div>
<p><strong>Patrick Ross</strong> and <strong>Jean Theroux</strong> will present a program of fiddle tunes and songs drawn from their  French-Canadian heritage. Ross, a frequent winner at fiddle contests throughout  Northern New England, is a fifth-generation  fiddler. Theroux is a well respected community-based fiddler and vocalist. They  will be joined by Dalton Binette and Bow Thayer.&nbsp; All four musicians hail from the northernmost  area of New Hampshire,  adjacent to the Canadian border, across which people and cultural influences  have flowed steadily over the last hundred years or more. The fiddle,  accordion, and guitar are the most common instruments used in French-Canadian  music. The playing style is spirited and based upon rhythmic patterns of the  Celtic world: jigs, reels, and waltzes. However, the music is not exactly  Celtic: the bowing style has a different swing and the tunes are ornamented in  a distinctive way. Singing in the French language with family and friends is  also an important part of French-Canadian musical heritage, and many of the  songs are classified as &ldquo;chansons &agrave; r&eacute;pondre,&rdquo; or &ldquo;call and response,&rdquo; a style  developed so a large group can join in the fun without knowing all the words.<a name="aug16"></a></p>

<p><strong>Bobby  Taylor</strong>, <strong>Robert Shafer</strong>, and <strong>Robin Kessinger</strong>, three of the Kanawha  Valley&rsquo;s best traditional musicians,  have played together over many years at various musical events in the Valley  and throughout West Virginia.  They were heavily influenced by the musical talents of Clark Kessinger, a world  renowned fiddler. Clark Kessinger recorded many tunes on the Brunswick label from 1928 to 1930, and later,  five albums in the 1960s. He has influenced a world of fiddlers and musicians  for many decades.&nbsp; Clark Kessinger lived  near where Robert, Robin and Bobby grew up in the Kanawha Valley,  and Robin is his great nephew. This trio uses Clark&rsquo;s  beautiful arrangements as a foundation for the music they play. Just like Clark  Kessinger, who used every technique possible, they continue to explore new and  exciting ways to play the great old tunes.<a name="aug23"></a></p>

<div class="date">Thursday, <span class="month">AUGUST 23</span> at 12:00 noon <em>(no tickets required)</em></div>
<p><strong>The Singing and Praying Bands of Delaware and Maryland</strong> (Eastern and Western Shore) belong to an African American  devotional/musical tradition that is unique to the Delmarva region, probably  the oldest living African American musical tradition in Delaware  and Maryland.&nbsp; In the past, almost half of the Methodist  churches around the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays had their own band.&nbsp; With origins in West African religion,  Christianity, and African American ring shout traditions, Singing &amp; Praying  Bands developed during slavery.&nbsp; The  ministry of the Singing &amp; Praying Bands takes place in host churches, often  at a camp meeting after an evening preaching service is over. Members line out  a hymn, pray a prayer, and end with a spiritual in which the group forms a  circle, marching counterclockwise out onto the church grounds. Since the 1950s,  the bands have diminished in number, and the singers have consolidated into one  large band comprised of fifty to a hundred active members from twenty to thirty  different churches. They come together most Sundays in the spring, summer, and  fall, at a different church each week, and hold service there, keeping this  tradition alive.<a name="sep13"></a></p>

<p>The Mexican tr&iacute;o  rom&aacute;ntico consists of three suave male voices backed by two, and sometimes  three, guitars, singing romance-drenched lyrics in lush harmony.&nbsp; The style rocketed to pan-Latin popularity in  1948 with the pioneering group Tr&iacute;o Los Panchos. <strong>Los Tres Reyes</strong> (The Three  Kings), known as &ldquo;the last of the great trios,&rdquo; epitomize the trio sound and  continue to make it a mainstay of Mexican acoustic music. High-voice Cuban  singer Bebo C&aacute;rdenas joins founding members, brothers Gilberto and Ra&uacute;l Puente,  to show us how, in C&aacute;rdenas&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;The tr&iacute;o rom&aacute;ntico is synonymous with  intimacy.&rdquo; The trio has a new album on the Smithsonian Folkways label called <em>Romancing  the Past</em> (SFW40562).<a name="sep26"></a></p>

  <em>Paraguayan Folk Harp Ensemble from Nevada</em></div>
<div class="date">Wednesday, <span class="month">SEPTEMBER 26</span> at 12:00 noon <em>(no tickets required)</em></div>
<p>The Paraguayan  folk harp is one of the most recognizable folk music traditions in South America. Las    Vegas resident Mariano Gonzales mesmerizes audiences  with his delightful and sometimes surprising repertoire on this handcrafted  traditional instrument. &nbsp;Mariano&rsquo;s career  as a professional harpist, composer, and harp maker has taken him around the  world and into multiple musical genres, but he remains enamored of the unique  and exquisite Guarania folk music of his homeland. Born and raised in Buena Vista, Paraguay, he began playing the harp  at the age of five, under the tutelage of his father and grandfather. His  passion for music propelled him onto the world stage where he expanded his  repertoire to include lively Latin rhythms, free-spirited jazz, and original  arrangements of popular standards. &nbsp;Since  moving to Las Vegas  to tour with Tony Orlando and Dawn, he has generously shared his beloved harp  with local audiences in community venues. His solo performances have included  concerts at prestigious venues including Carnegie Hall in New   York and Suntory Hall in Tokyo.</p>
