class='transcriptcontent'><p><strong>BILL MOYERS</strong>:
We are so close to losing our democracy to the mercenary class, it’s as if we are leaning way over the rim of the Grand Canyon and all that’s needed is a swift kick in the pants. Look out below.</p><p>The predators in Washington are only this far from monopoly control of our government. They have bought the political system, lock, stock and pork barrel, making change from within impossible. That’s the real joke.</p><p>Sometimes I long for the wit of a Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert. They treat this town as burlesque, and with satire and parody show it the disrespect it deserves. We laugh, and punch each other on the arm, and tweet that the rascals got their just dessert. Still, the last laugh always seems to go to the boldface names that populate this town. To them belong the spoils of a looted city. They get the tax breaks, the loopholes, the contracts, the payoffs.</p><p>They fix the system so multimillionaire hedge fund managers and private equity tycoons pay less of a tax rate on their income than school teachers, police and fire fighters, secretaries and janitors. They give subsidies to rich corporate farms and cut food stamps for working people facing hunger. They remove oversight of the wall street casinos, bail out the bankers who torpedo the economy, fight the modest reforms of Dodd-Frank, prolong tax havens for multinationals, and stick it to consumers while rewarding corporations.</p><p>We pay. We pay at the grocery store. We pay at the gas pump. We pay the taxes they write off. Our low-wage workers pay with sweat and deprivation because this town – aloof, self-obsessed, bought off and doing very well, thank you – feels no pain.</p><p>The journalists who could tell us these things rarely do – and some, never. They aren’t blind, simply bedazzled. Watch the evening news – any evening news – or the Sunday talk shows. Listen to the chit-chat of the early risers on morning TV -- and ask yourself if you are learning anything about how this town actually works.</p><p>William Greider, one of our craft’s finest reporters, fierce and unbought, despite a long life in Washington once said that no one can hope to understand what is driving political behavior without asking the kind of gut-level questions politicians ask themselves in private: “Who are the winners in this matter and who are the losers? Who gets the money and who has to pay? Who must be heard on this question and who can be safely ignored?”</p><p>Perhaps they don’t ask these questions because they fear banishment from the parties and perks, from the access that passes as seduction in this town.</p><p>Or perhaps they do not tell us these things because they fear that if the system were exposed for what it is, outraged citizens would descend on this town, and tear it apart with their bare hands.</p></div><div

Yes, the TV reporters are simply vacuous, pretty and overpaid, all looking and speaking like clones of one another. Of course, they take no risk in losing those jobs and the celebrity exposure, all  so superficial. Do we ever hear any really hard questions or direct, brief answers? Like many others, we  don&#8217;t watch the cozy reporters clutches, even on PBS any more. We read books and wait for the march on D.C.  when we must risk everything, our lives, our souls to save our sacred honor and this country from itself.</p></div></div></li><li

But where can a seriously interested citizen obtain the information that would answer the questions journalists should be asking? In other words, who is following the money? Who is tracking the power exchanges? Who is doing the detailed research and investigative work necessary to bring these culprits, who are literally stealing our nation, to justice? I find isolated spots of good journalism here and there, but nobody seems to take the responsibility for doing the full-blown research that needs to be done to empower us to actually do something about the power grab.</p></div></div></li><li

You mention Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert&#8217;s poignant satire, but Mr. Stewart creates trusts to separate him from his money to buy multi-million dollar Manhattan apartments and luxury mansions. And, to be frank, how do we trust someone like yourself, who played one of the biggest deflection roles in our government &#8211; press secretary &#8211; who then has transformed into a champion of the people? I can&#8217;t tell anymore who might be sincere.</p><p>Mr. Moyers, I&#8217;m a big follower of your programming throughout the years and I think you fill a very critical void in our media. However, you have to admit, if you were not you (let&#8217;s not be naive here &#8211; you are very well connected and I&#8217;m guessing not middle class either) but rather on the other side like most of us, would you trust anyone at all?</p></div></div></li><li

id="dsq-comment-message-46712" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I certainly agree with Mr. Moyers&#8217; as-usual cogent opinions here (I may as well call them fact); if I could, I&#8217;d like to add that IMHO in one way or another Mr. Stewart, Mr. Colbert, Lewis Black, the late George Carlin and new satirist Le Camp probably do some harm along with the good.  It&#8217;s hard to disagree that the absolute worst these pundits have said and do say about (put your favorite clay pigeon here) is richly deserved.  The unfortunate bit is that (as Mr. Moyers says) we laugh at their jokes and for a moment we think &#8216;Well, that puts ____ in their place.&#8217;  It doesn&#8217;t, however; the latest lunatic, half-wit or troll to inspire the above comedians&#8217; ire just keeps plugging along.  All that does take a hit is the target&#8217;s image.  Once the TV show is over, it decays to their afterimage, and our memory of the non-event decays as well.  The next time we tune in we&#8217;re just as ticked off &#8212; and ready to laugh &#8212; as last time.<br
/> Not very productive!  It also doesn&#8217;t help that in the modern era, thanks to the horrendous mess we&#8217;re all in, the satire of Walt Kelly (POGO) or Anatole France (PELICAN ISLAND, et al) has been to an extent superseded by the ridicule of Juvenal (his sixteen SATIRES of first century C.E. Rome smack more of Stewart and Black than Mark Twain).  When does ridicule become popular?  Often, when hope of positive change is past.  Maybe we&#8217;d all better think twice about that part.  Oh, pardon me, it&#8217;s time for the DAILY SHOW.</p></div></div></li><li

Who are YOU to trust? If you see a measure of hypocrisy, duplicity, or lack of integrity in anyone&#8217;s actions, you have every right to question their words AND actions.</p><p>You even have a right to bring your concerns to other people&#8217;s attention.</p><p>However, for me, I have to judge for myself.</p><p>I know that no one is perfect.

If you think it better to not trust anyone&#8230;then fine, your choice.</p><p>If however, you engage your thinking facilities, and use your own judgement to weigh the words and the essence of what *ANYONE* says, you&#8217;ll find that at times, even your most repugnant enemy might speak words of wisdom.</p><p>Who are you to know? I suggest, if you haven&#8217;t, you read Ayn Rand. Many, many people, including myself, find many things here and there to criticize in her works. However, she elucidated a point which, even those who find her ideas abhorrent, and that while it is in the extreme,  well serves many people&#8230;</p><p>&#8220;Who am I to know?&#8221;&#8230;</p><p>&#8220;Thinking is man’s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And his basic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of you practice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willful suspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think—not blindness, but the refusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act of unfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgment—on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict “It is.” Non-thinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate existence, an attempt to wipe out reality. But existence exists; reality is not to be wiped out, it will merely wipe out the wiper. By refusing to say “It is,” you are refusing to say “I am.” By suspending your judgment, you are negating your person. When a man declares: “Who am I to know?” he is declaring: “Who am I to live?”</p><p>Dropping below the level of a savage, who believes that the magic words he utters have the power to alter reality, they believe that reality can be altered by the power of the words they do not utter—and their magic tool is the blank-out, the pretense that nothing can come into existence past the voodoo of their refusal to identify it.</p><p>It is not any crime you have ever committed that infects your soul with permanent guilt, it is none of your failures, errors or flaws, but the blank-out by which you attempt to evade them—it is not any sort of Original Sin or unknown prenatal deficiency, but the knowledge and fact of your basic default, of suspending your mind, of refusing to think. Fear and guilt are your chronic emotions, they are real and you do deserve them, but they don’t come from the superficial reasons you invent to disguise their cause, not from your “selfishness,” weakness or ignorance, but from a real and basic threat to your existence: fear, because you have abandoned your weapon of survival, guilt, because you know you have done it volitionally.&#8221;</p><p>When you  bring into question the words of someone, based on what YOU see as reason for mistrust, I do hope you realize that it in no way diminishes their right to continue to speak out, nor does it diminish another person&#8217;s right to to think for themselves.</p><p>As a matter of fact, if you aren&#8217;t careful, you even place yourself in the position of bringing rejection to your your own words.</p><p>So&#8230;educate yourself. Teach others to educate themselves. Educate others.</p><p>Instead of always finding fault, do your best to look for what is good in all people. You may find that such imperfect humans, such as the 2 you cited, are incredible sources of illumination, even if YOU do not want to trust them!</p><p>Oh, and I&#8217;m sure that I will get the opposite reaction for my quoting of Ms. Rand.</p></div></div></li><li

While I enjoy the humor of Stewart and Colbert, I feel your straight talk is what we really need.  And yes, the people will eventually rise up against Washington, DC, and the scene will not be pretty!  For now, the best we can hope for is the appearance of more people like Elizabeth Warren, who want things to improve for the people of this country.  If you and others who do see the reality will just keep telling us what we need to hear, then we, the people, will hopefully use our votes to kick the greed out of our nation&#8217;s capitol.<br

The movie &#8220;Network&#8221; was the lighthouse that tried to steer us clear of these deadly reefs of social mediocrity and tolerance for political mendacity&#8211; in 1976. Peter Finch as the Mad Hatter expounding on the hypocrisy of the times&#8211;being used by Robert Duvall&#8217;s blackhearted corporate hatchet man. Finch, in a moment of his character&#8217;s clarity, tells the unvarnished truth to the American people on live TV. He tells the American people to just turn the TV off and keep it off. The tube is &#8220;utter madness&#8221; he says. The great manipulator, the great tranquilizer, the great mortally effective hitman with a contract on individuality. For the sake of profit and power for only a few.</p></div></div></li><li

A well planned and currently executed initiative by global power elite which has the audacity, in concert with government/corporate/defense, to dismantle and shred the very fabric upon which our patchwork quilt of a country and world is sewn together. Ownership through privitizing over the land, the sea and coastlines, the schools, the cities (urban shrinkage),the energy sources, etc. Even to the sorting mechanisms of measuring and testing to distraction our children&#8217;s minds for the sorting of the value added for a global workforce. Each of these working at odds with the other for the unraveling and final redesign of those that believe they have the entitlement to own and control everything and most exclusively us. Technology is their weapon of choice and robotics have become more important then humans. But robots do not have humor, or heart, or sensitivity, or morals or ethics, because they represent the input of those that have no shame and you can not shame the shameless whether human or robot. Those that would think themselves our masters. But in the end could be the distruction of all we hold dear if we as lemmings do nothing&#8230;.and then they came for me!<br

Democratic activists (rightly) cry out about voter ID laws and such, but that&#8217;s peanuts compared to the real voter disenfranchisement taking place as a matter of business as usual in DC when all of our representation is bought out from under us. Until that changes, not much else will. Ordinary folks like me despair at finding a solution in the face of massive entrenched opposition but we dream of a day when our government acts in the interests of the people before the demands of profit.</p></div></div></li><li

But the ordinary citizen who fights the policies that would benefit him materially are often misunderstood.  The AHA, for instance, which would insure all of us has become anathema, although it will cost much less in the long run than the current broken system.  But the Tea Party and the rest of the low-information crowd aren&#8217;t voting their best economic interests.  They&#8217;re voting their morality.  Progressive thoughts are evil.  They must be fought.  Material considerations are an epiphenomenon.  They don&#8217;t really count.  Wars require sacrifices.</p></div></div></li><li

So why do we keep looking to the political process to fix all these terrible problems? If there is any hope of a transformative revolution that might tackle and overturn this corrupt system, it will have to grow and change the world outside of the little self-enclosed, self-referential and self-serving bubble of power that you describe so clearly and relentlessly with each broadcast. The way out is by incrementally building a pervasive movement of refusal: a systemic abandoning of our participation, as citizens, in every aspect of the rigged game we cannot in any case win.</p></div></div></li><li

Without the means to be educated, to be employed with enough time away from work, to have the motivation to participate, the economic totalitarians will call the shots. The ownership economy has excluded many from the money and the power in this country, leaving it to those with the bare ambition, and greed to insinuate themselves and write the rules so that they may retain their power and money.</p><p>To get beyond this, the rest of us have to fight back, economically. By forming our own cooperative enterprises to meet our social, economic, cultural needs. Our Credit Unions, our Food Co-ops, our worker owned businesses are the nucleus for a future economy where we can take market share away from our present corporate overlords. It is only when their status quo is in jeopardy that they will grant enough attention to a movement that will right this imbalance.</p></div></div></li><li

We had a steady diet of the Vietnam war on TV on the evening news, along with commentary and all the protest march information . What we have now is a media that will ignore important events if they don&#8217;t match the agenda set for them. There is no free press, not really. The only thing that would make up for that is social media, and a focused message which is what the Occupy movement lacked. Change can happen still, regardless of the political atmosphere but it has to come from us.</p></div></div></li><li

/> Accroding to Mr. Hodges (truthdig,com) the history shows a feeble attempt is followed a real hard one 10 yrs later. This makes 2019 to be the year after Occupy Wall Street movement peetered out.<br
/> USA oligarchs are doing exactly what Britisher did to India. Keep the young &amp; restless busy with &#8220;education&#8221; to get the coveted &#8220;Civil Servant Job&#8221;. Once you have kids it is diffcult to partake in any movement against the establishment.<br
/> The US  education at HS level is mostly useless and many can&#8217;t even write a proper sentence upon graduation. They are selectively infested with drugs dealers. Try asking HS principal that you are willing to pay $100 for every drug dealing student (not user) and you will be deined. College level is done in a way so majority takes a more than 4 yrs to graduate. By the time you graduate, you are 23-25 yr range when you may end up starting a family or obligated with loans on college education, house, car. Minimum wage jobs for college graduates and raised with classic American middle class values forces us into thinking that work hard first to PAY off DEBT. Thus keeping the young and majority of revolutionaries off balance.<br
/> We continue to think in a lawful intervention. One MUST come to a conclusion that the change to the system which is rigged against you needs different ways to organize. They must be self propagating, small groups to attack the CANCER. Olden ways of organizing movement will simply not work. They will be infilterated very easily and made to fight with each other very easily.<br

When a few oligarchs in those colonies decided to rebel against those unjust British taxes the majority of the people living in those colonies (estimates range from 3 to 4 million) had no &#8216;right&#8217; to say anything, to vote for the candidates (who wrote the Declaration of Independence), or even the First Constitutional Convention. These &#8216;great&#8217; United States did not start out as a Democracy &#8230; and it never was (and this way it never will be). From an oligarchy to plutocracy, that&#8217;s how far we&#8217;ve come.</p><p>Ask some economists (or mathematicians): If everybody would put in &#8216;real&#8217; work to produce what this country (or the whole world) needs regarding food, clothing and shelter how many hours per week would we all have to work? In my humble estimation maybe 10-15 hours per person per week. The difference right now goes to pay for bureaucrats, bankers, brokers and other assorted &#8216;free-loaders&#8217; (lawyers) who are living off the back of the rest of the real workers who do the production today. (Talking about lawyers: Our population of 300 million + does really need close to the same number of laws we have?)</p><p>Just a few observations &#8230;</p></div></div></li><li

I do not like to fight a losing battle.</p><p>The US president is a &#8220;Figure Head&#8221;. Clinton, Obama, Bush are all spun from the same fiber. Corrupt to the core but have enough charisma to fool the public. The public has stopped thinking and almost on all counts is silent. Speaking out has consequences in USA just like Russia or E. Germany.</p><p>You are still thinking of working the system. The System needs dismantling. We need somebody like Jesse Ventura. The most critical 4th leg of democracy is the Press. We have very few journalist left to call it a press. The media is controlled and it is entertainment. FOX, MSNBC, CBS, NBC, ABC, radio, newspapers oh my what a sham.</p><p>The more educated &amp; polished a political candidate, the more inept he or she is. I voted for Obama and now feel like a fool. Naomi Wolf&#8217;s book is a must read for all Americans. She lays out 10 steps process for a dictatorial form of govt deployment which has been followed to a tee in the history. We are already there. In my opinion, those who do not see this, are good people who believe that people in power will retreat to moral and ethical values they are raised with. But it has been proven over and over again, give any man (or woman ) power, the transformation to undesirable state of mind happens with in days! Power must be distributed, which it was in our presidential form of government with 3 branches + 1(press). But when 2 of any 4 get in bed the game starts degenerating. When 3 out 4 come together, it is beyond fixing. And When 4 out 4 are in bed with each other, you have open form of autocracy. We are at 3.8/4.0 scale.</p><p>Still have a lot of fight left. But writing like this, I am now on &#8220;track list&#8221;.</p><p>Are there any politicians I like? Yes, I do. The likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Gov. Jesse Ventura &amp; Sen Sanders come to mind immediately.</p><p>It is a sad day as USA was the only BEACON of hope for people. And that hope was because of the middle class VALUES ( not economically). What a country full of philanthropic people and great modesty with absolutely no parallel in the history of mankind, for a nation, many times over powerful than rest of the world combined. USA was dismantled in a matter of last 3 decades starting with handful people. Carter was the last good president Sad saga for the rest of the human race. That&#8217;s how important was the middle class of America. It is destroyed in front of my eyes. Feel so powerless. Feel so ashamed that I am not doing &#8230;..</p></div></div></li><li

There are intelligent people who have a social awareness and thoughtful, insight into how things are and how things should be.

The legislature is infested with ALEC operatives (Speaker of the House Tillis and Asheville&#8217;s nemesis Tim Moffitt both on Board of Directors). Dismantling of Public Education, repeal of environmental standards, and attacks on voting rights all according to ALEC playbook. Privatization of infrastructure is also in progress, with the method of blatant theft of municipal assets key to maximizing profit. They have commandeered Asheville&#8217;s water system and 22,000 acre watershed, Asheville&#8217;s airport and Charlotte International Airport&#8212;-All with NO compensation to the cities that built these assets. (Lawsuits pending) There is no respect for State or US Constitutions, they just do whatever they want, legal or not. This is the future of our entire country, unfortunately started here. Moral Monday protests have drawn some national attention to the situation, but where do we turn for protection? It should be named as the Coup that it is and these operatives charged with Treason.</p></div></div></li><li

Bill Moyers is just another manipulator who couldn&#8217;t make it without ripping-off the taxpayer on PBS another so called virtuous deal that apparently can&#8217;t make it in the free market or won&#8217;t take the risk to try.  DO THE MATH WITH SOLAR, it doesn&#8217;t work. My neighbor put that stupid stuff on his roof, then his roof leaked, the panels get dirty and don&#8217;t perform as well, they degrade each year and you get less out of them in the end you pay just as much for solar as you do to the electric company and if we didn&#8217;t have to spend extra for electricity for the solar credits and if we&#8217;d let people freely compete to produce cheap oil and nukes (like France) solar would never pay for itself.  The production went to China because it is cheaper to produce there and the producers hope to sell it there and China won&#8217;t allow open free markets so companies do what they have to do for the cheap slave labor.  You&#8217;re living in a complete denial and the Trillions of dollars of debt from government clap trap waste and manipulation is going to blow the F up and wipe a lot of people out.</p></div></div></li><li

As for Mr. Moyers, while he now disparages BP for the way the lobbied themselves through the oil spill but had no problems taking oil company money when it came to sponsoring his early programs.  Both fail to take any responsibilities for the mess they have had a hand in creating.

They have survived many audits of their books, most of them prompted by conservatives, and they are correctly handling funds.</p><p>If you think that contraception is the same as abortion, that&#8217;s a separate discussion.</p><p>But the &#8220;We&#8217;re funding abortions with tax money&#8221; argument is either a lie or ignorance.

While the rest of the country has struggled with incredible hardships due to the decline of the housing market and rampant unemployment, the D.C. Metro area has been able to keep the very high standard of living it has become accustomed to.  Construction continued unabated and McMansions rose in outlying suburbs as if there were no economic crisis.  There are no boarded up businesses or homes in these areas and high end luxury cars are common in mall and shopping center parking lots.  No wonder people in the rest of the country are resentful &#8211; we would love to have the same kind of cash cow the D.C. Metro area is privy to.</p></div></div></li><li

I&#8217;ve watched this segment 3 times now and continue to come back to it again and again. I&#8217;ve listened to Bill Moyers offer controversial rhetoric in the past, somehow this seems different. A baptists minister presenting words this volatile, this inciting, it would seem a paradigm shift has occurred in the undercurrent of the nation&#8217;s sentiments and in the disposition those who would speak to them.</p><p>Indeed we are living in remarkable, perhaps bizarre, times. A city that use to represent the breadbasket of middle America declares the nation&#8217;s largest bankruptcy. A former veteran and Vietnam war protester, and someone who&#8217;s won the Nobel Prize for Peace are the 2 leading voices beating the drums for war against the will of its own people its allies and against the will of the world at large. And one of main perpetrators that almost single-handedly crashed world economy is poised to become the Chairman of Federal Reserve Bank. Amazingly, President Carter has even said: &#8220;America no longer has a functioning Democracy&#8221;.</p><p>And this is the short list. Those even casually paying attention should have their jaws perpetually on the floor. Something is dramatically different, dramatically askew as we seem to have crossed some kind of Rubicon of no return. If these events haven&#8217;t affected you on a profoundly deep level you either live in cave or need to check your pulse. A liberal man of peace of Moyers&#8217; stature heralding the day when its citizens rise up, storm the nation&#8217;s capitol and rip to to shreds, surely this denotes some kind of watermark that has not been seen before.</p></div></div></li><li

What began as a historic people&#8217;s movement that had the potential to change the course we&#8217;re on was quickly redefined (often by media marketed to liberals) as a Middle Class Only movement. So the rest of us, the former-middle class/poor, walked away, and Occupy died. The word itself is merely a  marketing term today. The poor are keenly aware of the degree to which middle classers support democracy &#8212; but only for the middle class. That said, regarding your comment about a &#8220;man of peace:&#8221;  Don&#8217;t confuse peace with passivity. Jesus was so outraged by the greed and hypocrisy he saw in the temple that he trashed it. (John 12:13)</p></div></div></li><li

When it comes to journalism, if you want the job, you have to play by the boss&#8217;s rules. Media marketed to liberals has a different problem: The issues they choose to cover, and the information that  is included/excluded from reports, is determined on the basis of the interests of the focus group (i.e., middle class consumers). That&#8217;s why those in liberal media, for example, have chosen not to report about how extreme our poverty crisis is growing.

The three World Trade Center buildings were not destroyed by two plane crashes and localized fires.  That is a fact, not opinion.  Recent polls suggest that nearly 50% of the public does realizes that the government&#8217;s story about what happened that day is incorrect.

One of its sore points was that there were no official spokesmen, and broad social changes need to have its leaders. However this is also one of its strengths. OWS is an example of pure, distributed progressive values. Leadership can be coerced or co-opted, but you can&#8217;t kill ideas. Those in the OWS movement haven&#8217;t stopped working for social advancement. And neither has leaderless groups like Anonymous or the Arab Spring which are simultaneously everywhere and nowhere.</p><p>The greatest efforts of social change in the 20th century were, like OWS, pacifist and non-violent. Gandhi took on the world&#8217;s greatest power by himself without resorting to violence and won. MLK achieved dramatic accomplishments with peaceful, civil resistance. Violence has always been the implement of the oppressor, resorting to violence delegitimizes your movement.</p><p>According to recent census data, most Americans are at or near poverty conditions. It is not accurate to suggest that that there is some profound ideological division between the abject poor and those who are at or near poverty levels. The problem in American society is economic disparity between the 99% and the 1%.</p><p>And I don&#8217;t agree that Moyers&#8217; words do not represent a paradigm shift in the sentiments of the American people or commentators like Moyers who speak to them. We are living in dramatic times with dramatic changes that are already upon us. Obviously these words are being used euphemistically to convey the seriousness of the moment. I doubt seriously armed insurrection and government overthrow is being advocated.</p></div></div></li><li

Even the own words of the POTUS at that time help to provide some insight.  Bush himself stated that &#8220;what we need is another Pearl Harbour&#8221;, well it&#8217;s common knowledge that FDR moved the Pacific Fleet out to Pearl to bait the Japanese into attacking so the US could enter the war.</p></div></div></li><li

Certain people can be silenced by marginalizing and making them look like fanatics or lunatics, Others can be silenced by revealing or threatening to reveal seedy aspects of their personal lives. Still others can be pitted against the IRS or other arms of the government thus diverting their energies away from spreading the TRUTH. My guess is that none of these approaches would work on someone as highly regarded and as morally grounded as Bill. So the only avenue left would be the tried and true method of fabricating a<br
/> fatal accident , or a previously unknown heart condition( subject found on a park bench) or the more expedient method of a lone gunman. My guess is Bill feels he can do more good staying in the game than becoming a martyr at this point.</p></div></div></li><li
