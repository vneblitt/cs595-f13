They certainly disperse an awful lot of deadly radioactive chemicals. They are every bit as horrifying as chemical weapons if not more, and by their very nature, suitable for only one purpose: wiping out an entire city full of civilians.

               <p>White phosphorus is a horrific incendiary chemical weapon that melts human flesh right down to the bone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2009, <a target="_self" href="/articles/37761/israel-claims-syria-used-chemical-weapons-but-israel-has-used-white-phosphorus">multiple human rights groups</a>, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and International Red Cross reported that the Israeli government was attacking civilians in their own country with chemical weapons. An Amnesty International team claimed to find "indisputable evidence of the widespread use of white phosphorus" as a weapon in densely-populated civilian areas. The Israeli military denied the allegations at first, but <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorus#Gaza_War_.282008.E2.80.932009.29">eventually admitted they were true</a>.</p>
<p>After the string of allegations by these NGOs, the Israeli military even hit a UN headquarters(!) in Gaza <a target="_blank" href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/un-israelis-hit-our-headquarters-in-gaza-with-white-phosphorus-shells-28462427.html">with a chemical attack</a>.

At one point in early 1988, Washington warned Hussein of an Iranian troop movement that would have ended the war in a decisive defeat for the Iraqi government. By March an emboldened Hussein with new friends in Washington <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_poison_gas_attack">struck a Kurdish village occupied by Iranian troops with multiple chemical agents</a>, killing as many as 5,000 people and injuring as many as 10,000 more, most of them civilians.

               <p>In the early 1950s, the Army set up motorized blowers on top of residential high-rises in low-income, mostly black St. Louis neighborhoods, including areas where as much as 70% of the residents were children under 12. The government told residents that it was experimenting with a smokescreen to protect the city from Russian attacks, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/10/03/army-secret-chemical-testing-in-st-louis-neighborhoods-during-cold-war-raising/">it was actually pumping the air full</a> of hundreds of pounds of finely powdered zinc cadmium sulfide. The government admits that there was a second ingredient in the chemical powder, but whether or not that ingredient was radioactive <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2210415/Revealed-Army-scientists-secretly-sprayed-St-Louis-radioactive-particles-YEARS-test-chemical-warfare-technology.html">remains classified</a>. Of course it does. Since the tests, an alarming number of the area's residents have developed cancer. In 1955, Doris Spates was born in one of the buildings the Army used to fill the air with chemicals from 1953 - 1954. Her father died inexplicably that same year, she has seen four siblings die from cancer, and Doris herself is a survivor of cervical cancer.</p>              </div>

               <p>Although nuclear bombs may not be considered chemical weapons, I believe we can agree they belong to the same category. They certainly disperse an awful lot of deadly radioactive chemicals. They are every bit as horrifying as chemical weapons if not more, and by their very nature, suitable for only one purpose: wiping out an entire city full of civilians. It seems odd that the only regime to ever <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki">use one of these weapons of terror</a> on other human beings has busied itself with the pretense of keeping the world safe from dangerous weapons in the hands of dangerous governments.</p>
