A person came in with a weapon that held a 100 round magazine and killed 12 innocent people, injured 58 and effected the lives of thousands who were either inside that theater or knew someone that was. My wife and daughter stood next to Alex&rsquo;s casket at the viewing a week later and was consoled by or helped to console some 3000+ people who came to pay their respects. I gave a eulogy for Alex in front of an overflowing church later that night. No family should have to go through what the three of us did and we must all do our parts to see that not another family has to. We love Alex, we think of him always and will forever miss him.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/28176\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Tom  S.'s story about Gun Violence, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/28176\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Gun+Violence&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Tom%20%20S.%20from%20Boulder%2C%20CO%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Gun%20Violence%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fgun-violence%2F28176%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","gun-violence_17219":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/distilleryimage7.instagram.com\/fbe683247b0711e28f4222000a1fb75e_7.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Missn my CoCo..\" \/>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"gun-violence\" data-story-id=\"17219\">53<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Jeaniqua J.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Danville, VA<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">My son, Lamonte &quot;CoCo&quot; Stone, age 14, as well as many other sons and daughters, was an innocent bystander shot dead in the street as if he meant nothing. I allowed him to go to his friends party that she would have on some Friday nights after school. They were middle school children but older teenagers or GROWN men rather that should never have been there, came and it turned into gang war where there was a gun pulled out inside the party causing kids to run outside into the streets to what they thought was safety. I had two other middle school children who were there but never ran out. My son CoCo went back to the house to make sure they were okay but was never let back in. He ran back across the street attempting to leave when gunfire erupted again. A bullet ripped through my 14 year old son's heart. I received a call from my daughter obviously before she knew her brother was laying shot in the street, telling me to come pick them up that there was shooting going on outside the party. I immediately left but before I could get off my street she called a second time yelling CoCo had been shot. I nearly wrecked my car trying to get to my children. Once I arrived there was chaos, kids and police cars everywhere but the scene that will forever haunt me is seeing my son lay lifeless in the middle of the street while blood ran from his body. I immediately prayed not realizing how bad it was even though there was no movement at all from my son. I gave up trying to run to him because the police stopped me every time. I told myself not to yell or cry out loud for fear of my son hearing me and knowing my voice, putting more stress on him while he lay fighting for his life. Finally the ambulance came, put him in the truck and fled to the hospital. I left soon after only to get there and hear after waiting for at least an hour that my son didn't make it. I then cried aloud and so did the hundreds of kids and people who came in support of my CoCo and my family. We were able to view his body before the police came in to begin their investigation. I saw the scars on his forehead and lip where he fell face-first after being shot and was unable to catch himself. I saw the hole in his chest were the bullet entered. My mom cried &quot;Get up CoCo&quot; to him as I kissed my son and rubbed his hair putting his dreads in place. One of the officers even told me that I couldn't kiss him but later she told me after I asked her if I could again that it was okay. I could see the sympathy in her face.  My life was forever changed on October 24, 2009. My surviving children are traumatized. My family will never be the same. The neighborhood is not the same. My son's killer was an 18 year old - a teenager from our neighborhood who would come play ball with my children or just hang around the neighborhood center. CoCo was a true angel who hated to see people hurt, crying, hungry, etc. He befriended an 80 year old white man and nicknamed him &quot;Buddy&quot;. Whenever Buddy knocked on the door hungry, CoCo would feed him, talk, laugh and dance with him. He loved animals and always found a way to bring some animal home from cats to dogs, turtles and ducks, my son had a caring heart. STRICTER GUN LAWS WERE NEEDED LONG BEFORE MY SONS MURDER AND THEY ARE DEFINITELY NEEDED NOW!<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/17219\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Jeaniqua J.'s story about Gun Violence, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/17219\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Gun+Violence&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Jeaniqua%20J.%20from%20Danville%2C%20VA%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Gun%20Violence%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fgun-violence%2F17219%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","gun-violence_18480":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/distilleryimage2.instagram.com\/edd144527b1d11e2a3d822000a1f9be5_7.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" \/>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"gun-violence\" data-story-id=\"18480\">52<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Lauren O.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Ridgefield, CT<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">On December 14, 2012, the world lost 20 beautiful children and 6 dedicated educators in Sandy Hook Elementary School. One of these children was my cousin Daniel. Daniel was an exceptional child, so loving and affectionate, playful and mischievous, energetic and effervescent, intelligent and exceedingly kind. He was the kind of child who would sit with someone who was alone and needed a friend. He would offer the last peanut butter cup to his 21-year-old cousin before taking it for his 6-year-old self. He would run out into the cold to kiss his older brother goodbye before he got on the bus. &lt;br \/&gt;Daniel had a bright and promising future - but that future was stolen from him by a mentally ill man with an assault weapon. As President Obama said in Newtown, we absolutely have a responsibility to do everything in our power to keep our children safe from harm. I hope that this horrifying event will serve as a moment of transformation in which we take an honest look at our society's relationship with violence and begin a dialogue that will move us towards broad and long-lasting change, both in Congress and in our homes.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/18480\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Lauren O.'s story about Gun Violence, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/18480\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Gun+Violence&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Lauren%20O.%20from%20Ridgefield%2C%20CT%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Gun%20Violence%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fgun-violence%2F18480%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","gun-violence_20140":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2167\/2215806074_39307022fc_z.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"183\" alt=\"tony\" \/>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"gun-violence\" data-story-id=\"20140\">42<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Sesily C.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Riverdale, GA<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">My name is Sesily Coleman and I became a widow at the age of 33.  On January 20, 2008, my husband, Antonio K. Coleman, Sr., an esteemed Atlanta Public Schools Elementary Teacher of the Year, was shot and killed by a bullet that did not have his name attached to it.  My children lost their father, his students lost their teacher, I lost my husband and the Riverdale, GA community lost a beacon of hope that loved to coach his son's football and baseball teams.  He simply went to Tampa to visit with his brother before leaving for a technology conference in Orlando.  While waiting in his rental car, two gang members began shooting into the area where Antonio was parked.  While his vehicle was still running, Antonio was shot once in the back of the head and died instantly while sitting in the driver's side of the vehicle.  His body was found a few hours later.  I had to bury my 36 year old husband who had just began working on his Ph.D in Education.  While in court, I was able to come face to face with both the murderers and the guns that were used during the shooting.  One was a semi-automatic rifle that stood just as tall as me.  Neither of the guns were registered to the then suspects who were eventually convicted of Antonio's murder.  They both received life sentences without parole.  However, that brings me nor my kids any relief.  It's horrible to watch your kids live in fear and cry as they have to live in the house we worked so hard for them to grow up in.  My daughter had to walk the hallway and pass the classroom where her dad taught everyday.  It hurt me to the core to watch her anguish about missing her dad.  My son is now 10 and still wants to know why his dad was in that &quot;box&quot; at church.  A huge piece of beauty was stolen from us 5 years ago.  I hope that the little light I've just shared with you will make a difference because my family, Team Coleman, deserves a vote.   -  Sesily   <\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/20140\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Sesily C.'s story about Gun Violence, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/20140\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Gun+Violence&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Sesily%20C.%20from%20Riverdale%2C%20GA%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Gun%20Violence%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fgun-violence%2F20140%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","gun-violence_14073":"<div class=\"content YouTube\">\n    <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QIN3kpTjNFo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"gun-violence\" data-story-id=\"14073\">148<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Sami R.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Saint Louis Park, MN<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">On September 27th, 2012, I was taking a bus, by myself, to go visit a friend and potentially future school, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My mom dropped me off at the bus stop at roughly 4:00 PM. About 30 minutes later, I saw an early report of a shooting in the Bryn Mawr neighborhood of Minneapolis, where my father had built his business.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;I sent a text message to my dad telling him that I heard that there had been a shooting nearby and to be careful.  Of course, what I did not know at the time was that his text to my dad would go unanswered because, just shortly before, he had been shot twice in the head at the company he had built.  This is something that I will go to bed every night and wake up every morning knowing. The gunman killed six fathers that day, all of them leaving behind their children far too soon. &lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Let's follow the President's lead so more kids won't have to experience a day like September 27th.&lt;br \/&gt;<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/14073\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Sami R.'s story about Gun Violence, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/14073\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Gun+Violence&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Sami%20R.%20from%20Saint%20Louis%20Park%2C%20MN%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Gun%20Violence%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fgun-violence%2F14073%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","gun-violence_14366":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"gun-violence\" data-story-id=\"14366\">66<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Michael M.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">New Bern, NC<\/h3>\n    <section class=\"full-text\">\n        <p class=\"summary\">\n            I am a Marine, and the argument my coworkers make is that violence will happen if guns are outlawed, so why do anything.

These weapons included many variants of bombs, missiles, and heavy cannon fire &ndash; military armament  designed to help our nation fly and fight.  Just as I would not like to see F-15s fully loaded being used by civilians, neither would I like to see Americans employing armed tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, armed drones, warships or any of the weapons that these systems employ.  &lt;br \/&gt;I support the right of American to bear arms.  &lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;I also support the President&rsquo;s gun safety proposals as developed by Vice President Biden&rsquo;s task force.  I would like to see universal background checks, limits to magazine sizes, and banning military style assault weapons.  Americans do not need to use M-16s or AR-15s or other military weapons such as fighter jets.  At what point is an arm considered too military?  I believe semi-automatic military assault weapons exceed that criterion.  Americans own arms that they use for hunting, target shooting, and self protection.  Banning assault weapons does not change this. &lt;br \/&gt;\n        <\/p>\n    <\/section>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/28241\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Jeff S.'s story about Gun Violence, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/gun-violence\/28241\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Gun+Violence&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Jeff%20S.%20from%20West%20Mclean%2C%20VA%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Gun%20Violence%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fgun-violence%2F28241%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","gun-violence_37672":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"gun-violence\" data-story-id=\"37672\">58<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">grace y.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Hampton, VA<\/h3>\n    <section class=\"full-text\">\n        <p class=\"summary\">\n            As a teacher in the public school system who has been entrusted with the teaching of young minds, it is pathetic to have to be asked to carry  a weapon instead of a textbook.

I will never forget the phone call I got from my mom that morning, hearing her cry as she shouted that there had been a shooting. We always assumed it was at the high school, where my dad and my brother were sitting in lockdown. It could have easily been either of them that day, or even my sister at the middle school. I work at a summer camp, and many of my campers were in Sandy Hook that day. I can't imagine the things that they saw that day. I fight because no town should ever have to go through what we did, and what we still do every day. I will never fully be able to explain what it feels like to to have your town, which no one ever knew before, thrust into the spotlight alongside of Columbine and Virginia Tech. That's why I march for gun control. That's why I fight.

He was randomly shot in the head while sitting in the car.  Last month, a relative was charged with second degree manslaughter and endangerment of a child when his 4 year old tragically and accidentally shot and killed his 2 year old.  He has the kindest heart ever and loved his family above all else, but none of that matters now as the media slanders him.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Eight years ago, I nearly lost my mother after she was shot 3 times in an armed robbery in my family's Mom and Pop Shop.  Nearly 17 years ago, my uncle fatally and accidentally shot his baby brother while out hunting.   &lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;How am I supposed to console my class of kindergartners over a classmate's death and tell them that they are safe, when I don't even believe it myself?&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Guns hurt people.
