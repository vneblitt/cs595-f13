   Edgar Mitchell Edgar Mitchell

   BLACKSBURG, Va., Sept. 9, 2013 - The [160]Institute for Creativity,
   Arts, and Technology will kick off its 2013-14 ArtsFusion seminar
   series on Friday, Sept. 20, with two public events featuring Apollo 14
   astronaut Edgar Mitchell, who will share his experiences as a lunar
   module pilot working on the moon's surface and present excerpts from a
   documentary film about his mission.

   Mitchell's visit to Blacksburg will include a public talk at 1 p.m. at
   the [161]Fralin Life Science Institute at 360 West Campus Drive, where
   he'll discuss his training and educational experiences that prepared
   him to become an astronaut. He will also detail the 1971 Apollo 14
   mission, where he became the sixth of only 12 people to step on the
   moon. Mitchell welcomes audience interaction during his talks and
   encourages participants to ask questions.

   At 10 a.m. the same day at the [162]Lyric Theatre in Blacksburg, the
   former astronaut will share portions of the 2006 documentary, "In the
   Shadow of the Moon," about his Apollo 14 mission. The screening will be
   followed by an open question-and-answer session.

   Both events are free and open to the public.

   In conjunction with Mitchell's Blacksburg visit, the Science Museum is
   sponsoring a [163]series of events in Roanoke, Va., including three
   presentations by Mitchell at the museum, one of which is part of a
   special dinner event on Sept. 20.

   "To the Moon" will include short film excerpts, a presentation by
   Mitchell, and a lunar-themed dinner and auction.  Mitchell's visit
   marks the beginning of a $575,000 fundraising campaign to re-equip the
   museum's 30-year-old Hopkins Planetarium Theater. Signed copies of
   Mitchell's book, "The Way of the Explorer," will be for sale at his
   appearances for $75. Mitchell will donate a portion of the book's
   proceeds to the Science Museum of Western Virginia.

   On Feb. 5, 1971, Mitchell became one of only 12 astronauts, including
   Buzz Aldrin and the late Neil Armstrong, to step on the moon. Only
   eight of those astronauts now survive.

   Mitchell, now 82, served as a test pilot for the U.S. Navy, and while
   on active duty he completed a master's degree in aeronautical
   engineering at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and a doctorate in
   aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mitchell also
   served as a fighter pilot during the Korean War and was awarded the
   Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1970.

   He was the lunar module pilot for the Apollo 14 mission in 1971, flying
   with Alan Shepard, who was the first American in space. The mission was
   watched closely around the world because it was America's return to
   lunar missions after the Apollo 13 near-disaster. It also was the first
   mission devoted to doing science on the moon. After retiring from NASA
   in 1972, Mitchell founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences and later
   wrote the book, "The Way of the Explorer." He has spoken all over the
   world about his space travel adventures.

   These events are co-presented by the [164]Science Museum of Western
   Virginia.

   A university-level research institute sitting at the nexus of the arts,
   design, engineering, and science, the [165]Institute for Creativity,
   Arts, and Technology is uniquely partnered with the Center for the Arts
   at Virginia Tech. By forging a pathway between transdisciplinary
   research and art, educational innovation, and scientific and commercial
   discovery, the institute works to foster the creative process to create
   new possibilities for exploration and expression through learning,
   discovery, and engagement. This includes preparing students in
   kindergarten through 12th grade and higher education environments to
   succeed in a world that demands teamwork and collaboration of science,
   technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines; promoting new
   research domains that transcend institutionalized boundaries; and
   participating with people of all ages in the process of co-creation.
