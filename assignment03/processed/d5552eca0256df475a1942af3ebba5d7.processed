Dan River Region research project could be a model to combat nationwide
obesity epidemic

   DANVILLE, Va., Aug. 12, 2013 - The Dan River Region of Virginia has the
   dubious distinction of being one of the most health-deficient areas of
   the United States.

   The area that stretches along the border of North Carolina from Patrick
   to Halifax counties has an almost 50 percent higher rate of diabetes
   than the rest of the country, a 5 percent higher rate of obesity, and
   17 percent of the area's residents live below the federal poverty line.
   One in four do not have health insurance.

   Fortunately, researchers at Virginia Tech are working on a solution to
   improve the health of residents of the Dan River area by developing a
   multi-pronged program that aims to incorporate not just nutrition
   education, but exercise initiatives and community gardens -- a
   multifaceted approach that could be used as a model to battle the
   obesity epidemic in similar communities across America.

   Associate Professor Jamie Zoellner and Assistant Professor Jennie Hill,
   both in the [162]Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise in
   the [163]College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, are helping lead the
   [164]Dan River Partnership for a Healthy Community, a
   community-academic partnership between Virginia Tech, [165]Virginia
   Cooperative Extension, and more than 50 local organizations including
   churches, government offices, grassroots organizations, and health
   professionals.

   The mission of the group is to foster community partnerships to combat
   obesity in the Dan River Region by educating the community about
   healthy lifestyle initiatives.

   The organization is working toward a solution to curb rampant obesity
   through a process known as community-based participatory research,
   which strives to engage local stakeholders in all aspects of the
   research process.

   "We know there is no one thing that is going to solve the obesity
   epidemic, so we are using several strategies to approach this issue,"
   said Hill, who along with Zoellner is a member of the [166]Fralin
   Translational Obesity Research Center. "We are engaging the entire
   community to address this problem from the ground up."

   Bryan E. Price, chairman of the organization and health and wellness
   program director for Danville Parks and Recreation, said members of the
   community jumped at the chance to improve their lives.

   "In this program, locals are invested in working to break the cycle of
   unhealthy habits," he said. "Healthier people are happier people, and
   in the long run, we feel that the improved health status will lead to
   an overall more successful Dan River Region."

   In the early stages of partnership, the community identified key areas
   it wanted to work in to address obesity: nutrition through community
   gardens, a physical activity program, and the built environment.

   Many parts of the Dan River Region are classified as "food deserts,"
   where people have limited access or no access at all to healthy,
   affordable foods. Outside the city limits of Danville in Pittsylvania
   County, there is only one grocery store within 1,110-square miles. That
   means that people are forced to shop at local, small convenience stores
   where choices are limited.

   Clarice Waters of Clifton, Va,. a doctoral student in the Department of
   Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise, along with other student research
   assistants, fanned out across the county to do an assessment of the
   more than 400 food outlets in the region to measure the accessibility
   of healthy food.

   The available food was rated on a scale of zero to 30, with zero
   representing unhealthy foods and 30 meaning there were a cornucopia of
   good options.

   "The entire region had an average of six," said Hill. "It goes to show
   that even if people wanted to eat healthy, they don't have access to
   healthy food options."

   This summer, expanding on a pilot project from last year, a gardening
   program targeting youth is being offered at six sites serving
   low-income youth.

   "It makes a difference in their lives because the successes and
   failures of their garden are based on the hard work, attitudes, time,
   and effort that they put in," said Tadashi Totten, a 4-H and youth
   development Extension agent.

   But instead of just planting gardens and assuming that they are
   inherently positive factors within the community, the researchers are
   measuring how much food comes out of them in order to ascertain how
   much of an impact the gardens will have on the area residents.

   After every harvest, the children are given lessons on the nutritional
   value of the vegetables they grew.

   "I think it's important to teach them when they are young so they know
   the benefits of being healthy so when they are older, they can teach it
   to their children, too." said Felicia Reese of Chester, Va., a human
   nutrition, foods, and exercise graduate student.

   The partnership has had several sources of funding in recent years. The
   Virginia Foundation for Healthy Youth has provided a consistent source
   of monies of about $140,000 over three years. The project recently
   received a three-year, $1.6 million grant from the National Institutes
   of Health to develop and test a childhood obesity treatment program. It
   also got a $45,000 start-up grant from the College of Agriculture and
   Life Sciences for the community garden initiative. The Danville
   Regional Foundation-Make it Happen!, the [167]Virginia Tech Institute
   for Society, Culture and Environment, and the [168]Virginia Tech Fralin
   Life Science Institute have also supported the project.

   Wen You, an associate professor of agricultural and applied economics,
   is also working on the project by providing statistical and econometric
   consulting as well as health economics expertise.

   So far, the program has had tremendous success, which in the long run
   might not just help the Dan River Region, but the U.S. as a whole.

   "America is in the midst of an obesity crisis and we hope that this
   model of academic partners such as Virginia Tech teaming up with local
   groups can be used to find solutions to solve the obesity epidemic
   around the U.S.," Zoellner said.

   Nationally ranked among the top research institutions of its kind,
   Virginia Tech's [169]College of Agriculture and Life Sciences focuses
   on the science and business of living systems through learning,
   discovery, and engagement. The college's comprehensive curriculum gives
   more than 3,100 students in a dozen academic departments a balanced
   education that ranges from food and fiber production to economics to
   human health. Students learn from the world's leading agricultural
   scientists, who bring the latest science and technology into the
   classroom.
