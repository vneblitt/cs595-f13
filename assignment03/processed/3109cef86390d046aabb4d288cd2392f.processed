The Privacy Act: What the Government Can Collect and Disclose about You

   Privacy is the watchword in the news these days. With the revelations
   in recent weeks about far-reaching domestic surveillance programs by
   the National Security Agency (NSA) and other Federal agencies that were
   expanded under the Patriot Act, Americans are scrambling to determine
   what privacy rights they have to information collected by the Federal
   Government.

   [15]Overview-of-the-Privacy-Act-of-1974-2012-Edition-9780160914461
   Thus, the timing is ideal to review a biennial publication,
   [16]Overview of the Privacy Act of 1974 (2012 Edition), available in
   print from the U.S. Government Online Bookstore.

   The [17]Overview of the Privacy Act of 1974 provides a valuable
   function to consumers, the media, Government and members of the legal
   profession by not only providing the current text of the Privacy Act
   and all its subsequent amendments, but also by consolidating the
   current regulations and updates, interpreting the Act's provisions and
   giving detailed legal analysis of the latest court decisions that have
   decided challenges to how the Privacy Act has been enacted by various
   White House Administrations and Federal Agencies since the Act was
   passed.

   What is covered by the Privacy Act?

   The Privacy Act of 1974 established a âCode of Fair Information
   Practice that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and
   dissemination of personally identifiable information about individuals
   that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies.â

   The Privacy Act protects certain federal government records pertaining
   to individuals. In particular, the Act covers âsystems of recordsâ that
   an agency maintains and retrieves by an individual's name or other
   personal identifier, such as your social security number.Â  (For
   clarification, a âsystem of recordsâ refers to a group of records or a
   file under the control of a particular Federal agency from which
   information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some
   identifier assigned to the individual.)

   With the advent of wide-spread use of computers and databases by the
   Federal Government, the Privacy Act was amended through the Computer
   Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, which added certain
   protections for the subjects of Privacy Act records whose records are
   used in automated matching programs, such as the establishment of Data
   Integrity Boards at each agency.

   Privacy Act Requirements

   But what rights do individuals have under the Privacy Act? According to
   the [18]Overview of the Privacy Act of 1974 (2012 Edition), it gives
   individuals the right to review records about themselves, to find out
   if these records have been disclosed, and to request corrections or
   amendments of these records, unless the records are legally exempt.

   From reading the publication, it seems the Act also requires that a
   Federal Government agency must:
     * give the public notice of their systems of records by publishing
       them in the [19]Federal Register (also available as a subscription
       from GPO);
     * follow strict record-keeping requirements;
     * request the written consent of the subject individual for
       disclosure of their personal information- âunless the disclosure is
       pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions;â and
     * provide individuals with a meansÂ  by which they can access and
       amend (review and correct) records stored about them.

   [20]Your-Right-to-Federal-Records-2011-cover Your Right to Federal
   Records

   For information about your rights to "discover, access and amend"
   Government records about you and frequently asked questions and answers
   about the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), you
   might want to check out the free publication, [21]"Your Right to
   Federal Records" available from the GSA's Federal Citizen Information
   Center (FCIC).

   You may also be interested in learning more about the Freedom of
   Information Act by reading the [22]Guide to the Freedom of Information
   Act, also published by the Justice Department and available in print
   from GPO.

   Scope Issues

   The Privacy Act does NOT apply to data collected about persons outside
   the United States, nor does it protect the privacy of your
   recordsÂ that are maintained by the private sector, such as your credit
   report, bank account and medical records or even local or state
   government records like your driverâs license. Since many Americans
   today assumed that the battle to keep this non-Federal data private was
   already lost, it was comforting to discover that there is still a
   measure of privacy in data kept about you by the Federal Government.

   And finally, while The Privacy Act does apply to the records of every
   "individual," it nevertheless only applies to records held by an
   "agency." Thus, any records âheld by courts, executive components, or
   non-agency government entities are not subject to the provisions in the
   Privacy Act and there is no right to these records.âÂ  The Overview
   covers many questions about scope.

   Exemptions and Exceptions

   The most fascinating part of reading the publication to me- and timely
   considering the current news cycle- was to learn that there are
   situations where the Government is not legally required to follow the
   Privacy Act . According to the Overview, there are currently Twelve
   Exceptions to the "No Disclosure Without Consent" Rule of the Act
   andÂ Ten Exemptions to the Privacy Act altogether where Federal
   agencies are not required to disclose records.Â

   Two of the ten exemptions outlined by the Overview are the âGeneral
   Exemptions,â which apply to records about individuals maintained by

   1)Â Â Â Â Â  the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and

   2)Â Â Â Â Â  law enforcement agencies- or a component thereofâ that
   primarily perform criminal law enforcement duties, âincluding police
   efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime or to apprehend
   criminals.â

   New proposed exemptions are offered all the time by subsequent
   Congresses and Administrations, such as the George W. Bush
   Administrationâs agreement signed with the European Union in 2007 to
   share an airlineâs Passenger Name Record as well as the utilize the
   Automated Targeting System.

   [23]Protecting-your-privacy

   The questions about what constitute personally identifying data; what
   legal exemptions and exceptions apply; and how the Privacy Act has been
   interpreted over time by Federal Agencies, the Office of Management and
   Budget (OMB) and the Federal courts make up a good part of the
   Overview.

   With post-9/11 security concerns driving Agencies' desire for more
   information coupled with rapidly evolving technologies that enable
   greater collection and analysis of data, the publishers of the
   [24]Overview of the Privacy Act of 1974 will certainly be kept very
   busy in upcoming years reporting on and analyzing new privacy
   regulations and court decisions that will follow.

   How Can I Obtain These Privacy Publications?

   Anyone concerned with the laws governing what the Federal Government is
   collecting and disclosing about individuals in the United Statesâand
   how much individuals can learn about itâshould read this important
   publication.

       Isn't knowledge about The Privacy Act of 1974 rather useless
       without also knowing specifically how The Patriot Act effects our
       privacy? Does the Patriot Act in any way modify the Privacy Act of
       1974?

            Good question, Jan! The "Overview of the Privacy Act"
            incorporates all recent and relevant laws and regulations that
            affect the Privacy Act, including the Patriot Act, through the
            date of the edition. Each provision of the Privacy Act is
            listed with recent interpretations, court decisions and
            modifications, so that readers can understand the current
            rules.
