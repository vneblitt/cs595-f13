Metro Sees a Decline in Ridership and Revenue

   Posted by [86]Perry Stein on Sep. 9, 2013 at 4:11 pm

   The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported Monday that
   its revenue for fiscal year 2013 came in at $853.6 million, $20.3
   million below projections.

   Around $6 million of this $20.3 revenue gap came from ridership losses
   from Hurricane Sandy and President Obama's unexpected deceleration of
   Christmas Eve as a federal holiday, according to "[87]Metro's FY2013
   Operating Budget Performance Review," which was first reported by
   [88]Dr. Gridlock.

   Metrorail also saw 9.3 million fewer trips than anticipated, which the
   report largely attributes to higher fare prices, changes to the federal
   transit benefit, and federal furloughs.  The rail system also saw a
   decline in weekend riders with a particularly dramatic drop in June:
   June 2012 had 12 percent more weekend rides compared to June 2013.

   Parking revenue was also below budget by $3 million, while bus
   ridership was $2.3 million above budget.

   On the plus side, [89]Metro's escalators are functioning at
   unprecedented levels.

       Yeah, when you charge people and make them wait in a station for
       half an hour for a train to arrive, you tend tend to lose the
       customers who couldn've walked there faster.

       Metro needs to bring the fare down to one price of $2.00 all day
       everyday. Service is too crappy and most of the attendants have bad
       attitudes.

       If you have to wait more than 10 minutes for a train, what's the
       point of using the system? And then there's the thug crime problem.
       What a beautiful system destroyed by mismanagement and bad
       politics.
