Heidi Klum Needs Attention Too, Y'All!

   9/16/2013 1:00 PM PDT, by [12]Emily Trainham
   0916_fish_heidi
   Heidi Klum seems like a sweet lady, right? She's absolutely gorgeous,
   obviously, and "Project Runway" is pretty great, oh, and she and Seal
   used to throw some killer Halloween parties, so she's probably at least
   halfway all right. But this thing she [13]said about Miley Cyrus? It's
   just dumb. Sorry, but it is.
   "I'm sort of in between chairs. On one side, I like that she pushes the
   envelope and she owns it. There is right now no one who is like her.
   But at the same time, do I want my girls to dress like that? I don't.
   Do I want my girls to look up to the way she performs? No, I don't. I
   have to say I am a little in between chairs. I think as an artist you
   have to have your own [expression] and not copy someone and express
   yourself and that's what she's doing. I'm a little here and a little
   there."
   Look, can we get past being absolutely scandalized by Miley already?
   She's wacky, we got it. She can be super annoying. Her twerking schtick
   is awkward. She's trying to show everyone that she's a grown up. But
   she didn't murder anybody, and she's not going to be the downfall of
   society. Please can we just stop acting like she's dangerous or
   something and go back to talking about how ridiculous she is?
   Also, Heidi, your daughters are nine and three. If you have to worry
   about them dressing like Miley and looking up to the way she performs,
   you probably have some bigger fish to fry, girl.

   Her comment made perfect sense to me. The only part that was different
   was that she said "two chairs," instead of "two minds" like we would in
   the U.S. Since she's not American, she used different phrasing. So
   what?

   Maybe she's just too nice to say what you want her to say, which is
   that Miley is ridiculous. Grow up!

   What she said is not dumb! The so-called "journalist" who wrote this IS
   dumb! We don't even know the source! Maybe Heidi was asked about Miley
   and she just gave her opinion she never said that Miley was dangerous
   or something! Emily Trainham you really suck my dear!

   What part in her statement was dumb? She didn't describe Miley as
   dangerous. She's just concerned about the image Miley is portraying,
   especially for young girls. Goodness! Try to read her comment again!

   You know what is dumb??? Sleeping with your bodyguard while you are
   still married and act like you guys started dating after you broke up
   with you husband...Heidi Klum. Before you judge Miley make sure your
   life is perfect.

   I don't see a problem with what she said. I completely agree with her.
   Pretty sure she wasn't speaking literally about HER daughters. She's
   making a statement. "I wouldn't want my daughters to dress like that".

   I agree with Ray, and this isn't about Emily. Heidi literally gets
   naked in front of her kids at the beach with a body guard she slept
   with while married? Please, maybe her kids will be like her instead of
   Miley.

   Sorry Emily, I don't see the big deal. Casual type of conversation. I
   guess we gotta go sensational so we can get the clicks on the article,
   huh? Journalism is not what it used to be.

   Heidi, do you want your children to know you slept with an employee
   while married to their dad?

   Do you want your children to know your are still paying your boyfriend
   to be "your bodyguard". He has no job but to hang with your family?

   Worry about your children and hope they won't be like you.

   The articles written by the fishwrapper staff often seem petty and just
   plain stupid. What Klum said is absolutely accurate. I get it. I
   understand Miley is a 20 year old girl and many 20 year olds make
   outrageous choices. It is a time of exploration into finding out who
   you really are and also a time to let loose. Klum understands that this
   is normal but at the same time would any parent want their child out
   acting like a whore and doing drugs? Absolutely not. Let's face it.
   There are probably many young ladies looking up to Miley thinking what
   she does is cool. Klum doesn't want that type of influence on her child
   and as much as it is a parent's responsibility to keep their child from
   certain things kids do have a mind of their own. Klum is the smart one.
   This article is what is dumb.

   Emily, I think your comments are the ones that are "dumb". Seriously
   you are so far off the mark and Heidi is the one who is spot
   on....Especially when it comes to her concerns for her daughters.
   You're judgements seem to be a wee bit "off" to me. (Please don't

   Emily Trainham...this is just plain silly. I have to wonder if Heidi
   was ASKED her feelings on the situation, and this was her very elegant,
   thoughtful response.

   Please Emily, if you need attention this badly, do it at a real
   a**hole's expense, not a caring Mother of two young girls, who has a
   right to weigh in on the matter.

   shame.

   Why do we always assume that liking a song.. or a person.. or a movie..
   means our kids need to 'look up' to these people?? I mean how many hall
   of fame musicians are druggies.. we love the music.. do we 'look up to
   them' for our life lessons and values??.. or do we just love their
   music?? Why is everything an issue of 'looking up to' ?? Why can't we
   just enjoy (or not) what performers give us and leave it at that? Why
   are they suddenly held up to 'idol' status? You can't do that , you are
   an 'idol' to kids. Sorry you are you first... I have never seen anyone
   claim to be an idol... you don't get to label someone as an idol and
   then dictate, praise or berate their actions when they don't meet
   'your' ideal of what the person should represent. We are all our own
   individual selves who do what we do. Like it or not.
