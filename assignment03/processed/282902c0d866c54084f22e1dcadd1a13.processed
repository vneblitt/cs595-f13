   On this week's episode of All Songs Considered, co-host Bob Boilen
   basks in the glory of his return by making fellow co-host Robin Hilton
   enjoy the musings of a box that when opened plays affirming statements
   with Bob's name that was gifted to him by a secret admirer. The theme
   of good vibes continues when artists that were featured on some of the
   earliest episodes of All Songs Considered, such as [54]TV On The Radio
   and [55]Rokia Traore, return with new music.

   NPR Music's Lars Gotrich joins the discussion to explain post-metal in
   light of a new track from metal juggernauts Pelican. NPR Music intern
   Thor Slaughter brings the self-described "#1 cut" of Jackson and His
   Computerband. All that and more on this week's episode, and don't
   forget: "You're the best, Bob."

   We've also got a new video to go along with our TV On The Radio
   premiere. The new single from the band is called "Million Miles."

   TV On The Radio's Kyp Malone tells us via email that "It's fun to take
   the idea of a song outside of the world of sound, give it fuller
   expression, expand its dimensions. I've wanted to collaborate with
   [director] Natalia [Leite] since I first saw her work and I thought
   this would be a good opportunity. We got a lot of help from a lot of
   creative people. Very excited to get to tell a story in this form."

   When they first emerged, we called TV On The Radio "one of the most
   unique acts of the new decade." That would be the last decade. "One of
   the first bands we ever featured on [All Songs Considered]," Robin
   recalls. The longtime indie favorites have a full length in the works
   but are tiding us over with [59]another one-off single, featuring a
   lush and dreamy sound.

   "The songs build in really potent ways," says Bob Boilen of this
   Brooklyn-based indie pop five piece. Maybe it's the dual lead vocals of
   Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig that give Lucius, which is quickly
   becoming a favorite, something extra.

   This album is also available for [63]pre-order via iTunes.

   "They came up at a time in metal where post-metal happened," says Lars
   Gotrich of Pelican. "It was more melodic, resembling post-rock." The
   group, which has been around for 13 years, is readying a new album.

   Glow is Jackson and His Computerband's second album, following Smash in
   2005. "It's glitchy, big and boisterous. It's a bit harder than most
   electro-pop out there," says Thor Slaughter.
