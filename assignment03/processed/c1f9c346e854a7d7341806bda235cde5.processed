   IAEA's 57th Annual General Conference in Vienna, Austria, the UN
   unveiled a new system for classifying, estimating and reporting how
   much uranium is available within a particular location. This system
   also applies to the evaluation of oil, gas, coal and thorium reserves.
   But trying to get the many uranium-producing countries around the world

   the critical need to safely and securely disposal of these sources.
   Radioactive sources are used for beneficial purposes in industry,
   medicine, agriculture, research and education. Once radioactive sources
   have reached the end of their useful life, their disposal must be
   carefully managed so that they cannot present an environmental hazard
   or a danger to people. [94]More ->
