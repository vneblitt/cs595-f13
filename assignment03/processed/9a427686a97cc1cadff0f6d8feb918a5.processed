    1. Use bottled water that has not been exposed to flood waters if it
       is available.
    2. If you don't have bottled water, you should boil water to make it
       safe. Boiling water will kill most types of disease-causing
       organisms that may be present. If the water is cloudy, filter it
       through clean cloths or allow it to settle, and draw off the clear
       water for boiling. Boil the water for one minute, let it cool, and
       store it in clean containers with covers.
    3. If you can't boil water, you can disinfect it using household
       bleach. Bleach will kill some, but not all, types of
       disease-causing organisms that may be in the water. If the water is
       cloudy, filter it through clean cloths or allow it to settle, and
       draw off the clear water for disinfection. Add 1â8 teaspoon (or 8
       drops) of regular, unscented, liquid household bleach for each
       gallon of water, stir it well and let it stand for 30 minutes
       before you use it. Store disinfected water in clean containers with
       covers.
    4. If you have a well that has been flooded, the water should be
       tested and disinfected after flood waters recede. If you suspect
       that your well may be contaminated, contact your local or state
       health department or agriculture extension agent for specific
       advice.

   U.S. federal agencies and the Red Cross recommend these same four steps
   to disinfect drinking water in an emergency. Please, read each tab
   below for important details about disinfection, how to choose a
   disinfection method, and 7 Steps to Emergency Drinking Water
   Disinfection.

   In times of crisis, follow advice from local officials. Local health
   departments or public water systems may urge consumers to use more
   caution or to follow additional measures than the information provided
   here.

   Look for other sources of potable water in and around your home.
   When your home water supply is interrupted by natural or other forms of
   disaster, you can obtain limited amounts of water by draining your hot
   water tank or melting ice cubes. In most cases, well water is the
   preferred source of drinking water. If it is not available and river or
   lake water must be used, avoid sources containing floating material and
   water with a dark color or an odor. Generally, flowing water is better
   quality than stagnant water.

   Examine the physical condition of the water.
   When emergency disinfection is necessary, disinfectants are less
   effective in cloudy, murky or colored water. Filter murky or colored
   water through clean cloths or allow it to settle. It is better to both
   settle and filter. After filtering until it is clear, or allowing all
   dirt and other particles to settle, draw off the clean and clear water
   for disinfection. Water prepared for disinfection should be stored only
   in clean, tightly covered, containers, not subject to corrosion.

Choose a disinfection method.

   Boiling and chemical treatment are two general methods used to
   effectively disinfect small quantities of filtered and settled water.

Boiling

   Boiling is the surest method to make water safe to drink and kill
   disease-causing microorganisms like Giardia lamblia and
   Cryptosporidium, which are frequently found in rivers and lakes.
   These disease-causing organisms are less likely to occur in well water
   (as long as it has not been affected by flood waters). If not treated
   properly and neutralized, Giardia may cause diarrhea, fatigue, and
   cramps after ingestion. Cryptosporidium is highly resistant to
   disinfection. It may cause diarrhea, nausea and/or stomach cramps.
   People with severely weakened immune systems are likely to have more
   severe and more persistent symptoms than healthy individuals. Boil
   filtered and settled water vigorously for one minute (at altitudes
   above one mile, boil for three minutes). To improve the flat taste of
   boiled water, aerate it by pouring it back and forth from one container
   to another and allow it to stand for a few hours, or add a pinch of
   salt for each quart or liter of water boiled.

   If boiling is not possible, chemical disinfection of filtered and
   settled water collected from a well, spring, river, or other surface
   water body will still provide some health benefits and is better than
   no treatment at all.

Chemical Treatment

   When boiling is not practical, certain chemicals will kill most harmful
   or disease-causing organisms.
   For chemical disinfection to be effective, the water must be filtered
   and settled first. Chlorine and iodine are the two chemicals commonly
   used to treat water. They are somewhat effective in protecting against
   exposure to Giardia, but may not be effective in controlling more
   resistant organisms like Cryptosporidium. Chlorine is generally more
   effective than iodine in controlling Giardia, and both disinfectants
   work much better in warm water.

   You can use a non-scented, household chlorine bleach that contains a
   chlorine compound to disinfect water.
   Do not use non-chlorine bleach to disinfect water. Typically, household
   chlorine bleaches will be 5.25% available chlorine. Follow the
   procedure written on the label. When the necessary procedure is not
   given, find the percentage of available chlorine on the label and use
   the information in the following table as a guide. (Remember, 1â8
   teaspoon and 8 drops are about the same quantity.)
   If the strength of the bleach is unknown, add ten drops per quart or
   liter of filtered and settled water. Double the amount of chlorine for
   cloudy, murky or colored water or water that is extremely cold.

   CAPTION: Chlorine Disinfection

   Available Chlorine Drops per Quart/Gallon of Clear Water Drops per
   Liter of Clear Water
   1% 10 drops per Quart - 40 per Gallon 10 per Liter
   4-6% 2 drops per Quart - 8 per Gallon (1â8 teaspoon) 2 per Liter
   7-10% 1 drop per Quart - 4 per Gallon 1 per Liter

   CAPTION: If the strength of the bleach is unknown, add ten drops per
   quart or liter of filtered and settled water. Double the amount of
   chlorine for cloudy, murky or colored water or water that is extremely
   cold.

   Mix the treated water thoroughly and allow it to stand, preferably
   covered, for 30 minutes. The water should have a slight chlorine odor.
   If not, repeat the dosage and allow the water to stand for an
   additional 15 minutes. If the treated water has too strong a chlorine
   taste, allow the water to stand exposed to the air for a few hours or
   pour it from one clean container to another several times.

   You can use granular calcium hypochlorite to disinfect water.
   Add and dissolve one heaping teaspoon of high-test granular calcium
   hypochlorite (approximately Â¼ ounce) for each two gallons of water, or
   5 milliliters (approximately 7 grams) per 7.5 liters of water.

   The mixture will produce a stock chlorine solution of approximately 500
   milligrams per liter, since the calcium hypochlorite has available
   chlorine equal to 70 percent of its weight.

   To disinfect water, add the chlorine solution in the ratio of one part
   of chlorine solution to each 100 parts of water to be treated. This is
   roughly equal to adding 1 pint (16 ounces) of stock chlorine to each
   12.5 gallons of water or (approximately Â½ liter to 50 liters of water)
   to be disinfected.

   To remove any objectionable chlorine odor, aerate the disinfected water
   by pouring it back and forth from one clean container to another.

   You can use chlorine tablets to disinfect filtered and settled water.
   Chlorine tablets containing the necessary dosage for drinking water
   disinfection can be purchased in a commercially prepared form. These
   tablets are available from drug and sporting goods stores and should be
   used as stated in the instructions.

   When instructions are not available, use one tablet for each quart or
   liter of water to be purified.

   You can use tincture of iodine to disinfect filtered and settled water.
   Common household iodine from the medicine chest or first aid kit may be
   used to disinfect water. Add five drops of 2% U.S. or your countryâs
   approved Pharmacopeia tincture of iodine to each quart or liter of
   clear water.

   For cloudy water add ten drops and let the solution stand for at least
   30 minutes.

   You can use iodine tablets to disinfect filtered and settled water.
   Purchase commercially prepared iodine tablets containing the necessary
   dosage for drinking water disinfection at drug and sporting goods
   stores. Use as stated in instructions.

   When instructions are not available, use one tablet for each quart or
   liter of filtered and settled water to be purified.

   Only use water that has been properly disinfected for drinking,
   cooking, making any prepared drink, or for brushing teeth.
