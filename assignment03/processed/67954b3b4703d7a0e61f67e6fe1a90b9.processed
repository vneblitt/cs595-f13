   Breaking News
   [47]091213_kanye_rant_launch_v2
   **GRAPHIC LANGUAGE**
   Another EPIC rant from Kanye West!!!!
   This time, he's bitchin' about the evilness of corporations, how he
   hates sellouts and why people who put "numbers" on the back of their
   shirts are crappy designers.
   IT'S AWESOME!!!
   Kanye was at a listening party for his pal Pusha T in Manhattan last
   night, when he grabbed the mic and went off -- admitting he'd been
   hittin' the Grey Goose pretty hard earlier in the night.
   Nobody was harmed in the making of this video ... but he did take some
   time to brag about himself:
   "We make good music, we make good music. We don't give a F*CK about how
   much god damn money you make, we make good music!"

   I wonder what a psychiatrist would say if this weirdo was anaylized.
   Something is seriously wrong with him! And to think, he is a dad now.
   Poor child.

   Don't you mean Kanye IS a drunk. Since you diagnosed Lamar, it just

   Wow...I think if old momager is concerned about Lamar tarnishing the
   BRAND, she better take a good look @ this narcissistic loser. I feel so
   bad for that poor little baby North with parents like that. All the
   money they all have won't buy them class, respect or integrity. They
   are a mess...

   Kanye, you love corporations. You love the fashion INDUSTRY. You love
   to perform for corrupt heads of state. You are a fraud.
