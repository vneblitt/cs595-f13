Obamacare hits a tipping point: Most governors now want to expand Medicaid

   Welcome to Health Reform Watch, Sarah Kliffâs regular look at how the
   Affordable Care Act is changing the American health-care system â and
   being changed by it. You can reach Sarah with questions, comments and
   suggestionsÂ [345]here. Check back every Monday, Wednesday and Friday

   Days until marketplaces launch: 15.

   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (AP)

   The Medicaid expansion appears to be, well, expanding, and it's
   happening with the support of Republican governors.

   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett is expected to [347]announceÂ on Monday
   afternoon his support for expanding Medicaid in his state to 500,000
   currently uninsured Pennsylvanians. Earlier Monday, Michigan Gov. Rick
   Snyder [348]signed legislation that will expand the Medicaid program in
   his state, as well.

   Between Pennsylvania and Michigan, you're looking at more than 800,000
   people becoming eligible for new health law programs. And if the
   Pennsylvania expansion does go through, it would be the 26th state to
   expand Medicaid, meaning that the majority of states had decided to opt
   into a massive health law provision that the Supreme Court decision
   last year accepted.

   [349]medicaid map Pennsylvania is not a done deal: The Philadelphia
   Inquirer [350]reports that Corbett wants to include provisions that
   would require Medicaid recipients to be actively searching for work,
   and it will ultimately be up to the federal government to decide
   whether to approve such a provision.

   Still, the wave of action just weeks before open enrollment launches
   suggests that some Republican governors are more open to the health law
   program. And it seems to come down to two key factors: the massive
   amount of federal funds at play, and Republicans' sense of the leverage
   they have in this situation.

   First, the money: In Michigan, Snyder has referred to federal funding
   often in making his case for a Michigan Medicaid expansion. ""The
   Healthy Michigan plan is vital to the health of our families and the
   economic success of our state," he said in[351] one statement in late
   June, when he was pushing the state legislature to sign off on the
   proposal.

   Michigan is expected to get an additional $25 billion in federal
   funding over the next decade through the Medicaid expansion, while
   spending an additional $4 billion of state funds to cover over 300,000
   people. The reason the funding tilts so heavily in the direction of the
   federal government has to do with the law: It has the feds pay for 100
   percent of the cost of the newly expanded Medicaid population for three
   years. After 2017, the match begins to fall, over the course of a few
   years, to 90 percent.

   That's not the entire cost, but it's certainly a better deal than the
   traditional Medicaid funding arrangement, where the federal government
   covers about half the costs.

   The second factor driving these decisions has to do with Medicaid
   waivers -- when governors want permission from the federal government
   to try something new with the program. Republican governors have
   increasingly come to see their decision on Medicaid expansion as
   allowing them leverage to request big changes to the program.

   We saw this in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott's [352]decision to
   support the Medicaid expansion came alongside the federal government
   granting a waiver allowing for greater use of private health insurance
   plans in the public program. The Florida legislature did not ultimately
   move forward with the policy.

   Pennsylvania's Corbett also looks like he wants to pursue significant
   changes to the state Medicaid program.Â "Corbett's 'Healthy PA' plan
   will contain additional provisions such as co-pays and work-search
   requirements for both new and existing Medicaid recipients," the
   Philadelphia Inquirer reports. "Their co-pays would be based on income
   that would be capped at $25 a month."

   To have two Republican governors moving forward with the health law
   program on the same day suggests that some of these incentives are
   enticing more governors as the insurance expansion nears.

   KLIFF NOTES: Top health policy reads from around the Web.Â

   States balk at ending Medicaid contracts.Â "In Florida, a national
   managed care companyâs former top executives were convicted in a scheme
   to rip off Medicaid. In Illinois, a state official concluded two
   Medicaid plans were providing âabysmalâ care. In Ohio, a nonprofit paid
   millions to settle civil fraud allegations that it failed to screen
   special needs children and faked data.Â Despite these problems, state
   health agencies in these - and other states - continued to contract
   with the plans to provide services to patients on Medicaid, the
   federal-state program for the poor and disabled." [353]Jenni Bergal in
   The Washington Post.Â

   Are wellness programs ready for primetime?Â "Whether wellness programs
   work as intended or not, letâs recognize what they also do: They
   increase the cost of coverage for some employees. That saves employers
   money but by shifting costs to workers. Those who bear the brunt of
   this increase are the less healthy employees, who also tend to be those
   of lower socioeconomic status."Â [354]Austin Frakt and Aaron Carroll
   for Bloomberg.Â
