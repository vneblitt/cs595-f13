   Observed in the wild, tucked away in museum collections, and even
   exhibited in zoos around the world-there is one mysterious creature
   that has been a victim of mistaken identity for more than 100 years. A
   team of Smithsonian scientists, however, uncovered overlooked museum
   specimens of this remarkable animal, which took them on a journey from
   museum cabinets in Chicago to cloud forests in South America to
   genetics labs in Washington, D.C. The result: the olinguito
   (Bassaricyon neblina)-the first carnivore species to be discovered in
   the American continents in 35 years. The team's discovery is published
   in the Aug. 15 issue of the journal ZooKeys.

   The olinguito (oh-lin-GHEE-toe) looks like a cross between a house cat
   and a teddy bear. It is actually the latest scientifically documented
   member of the family Procyonidae, which it shares with raccoons,
   coatis, kinkajous and olingos. The 2-pound olinguito, with its large
   eyes and woolly orange-brown fur, is native to the cloud forests of
   Colombia and Ecuador, as its scientific name, "neblina" (Spanish for
   "fog"), hints. In addition to being the latest described member of its
   family, another distinction the olinguito holds is that it is the
   newest species in the order Carnivora-an incredibly rare discovery in
   the 21st century.

   "The discovery of the olinguito shows us that the world is not yet
   completely explored, its most basic secrets not yet revealed," said
   Kristofer Helgen, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian's National
   Museum of Natural History and leader of the team reporting the new
   discovery. "If new carnivores can still be found, what other surprises
   await us? So many of the world's species are not yet known to science.
   Documenting them is the first step toward understanding the full
   richness and diversity of life on Earth."
   [37]The olinguito ("Bassaricyon neblina") came close to being
   discovered several times during the past century and was even exhibited
   in zoos. For example, this female olinguito lived in various zoos in
   the U.S. decades ago. The problem was a case of mistaken identity,
   which was solved with a decade of detective work by Smithsonian
   scientist Kristofer Helgen and his team, resulting in the description
   of a new species. (Photo by I. Poglayen-Neuwall)

   Discovering a new species of carnivore, however, does not happen
   overnight. This one took a decade, and was not the project's original
   goal-completing the first comprehensive study of olingos, several
   species of tree-living carnivores in the genus Bassaricyon, was.
   Helgen's team wanted to understand how many olingo species should be
   recognized and how these species are distributed-issues that had long
   been unclear to scientists. Unexpectedly, the team's close examination
   of more than 95 percent of the world's olingo specimens in museums,
   along with DNA testing and the review of historic field data, revealed
   existence of the olinguito, a  previously undescribed species.

   The first clue came to Helgen from the olinguito's teeth and skull,
   which were smaller and differently shaped than those of olingos.
   Examining museum skins revealed that this new species was also smaller
   overall with a longer and denser coat; field records showed that it
   occurred in a unique area of the northern Andes Mountains at 5,000 to
   9,000 feet above sea level-elevations much higher than the known
   species of olingo. This information, however, was coming from
   overlooked olinguito specimens collected in the early 20th century. The
   question Helgen and his team wanted to answer next was: Does the
   olinguito still exist in the wild?

   To answer that question, Helgen called on Roland Kays, director of the
   Biodiversity and Earth Observation Lab at the North Carolina Museum of
   Natural Sciences, to help organize a field expedition.
   [38]The olinguito is so far known only from cloud forest habitats in
   Colombia and Ecuador, but future investigations might show that it
   occurs in similar habitats in other South American countries.

   The olinguito is so far known only from cloud forest habitats in
   Colombia and Ecuador, but future investigations might show that it
   occurs in similar habitats in other South American countries.

   "The data from the old specimens gave us an idea of where to look, but
   it still seemed like a shot in the dark," Kays said. "But these Andean
   forests are so amazing that even if we didn't find the animal we were
   looking for, I knew our team would discover something cool along the
   way."

   The team had a lucky break that started with a camcorder video. With
   confirmation of the olinguito's existence via a few seconds of grainy
   video shot by their colleague Miguel Pinto, a zoologist in Ecuador,
   Helgen and Kays set off on a three-week expedition to find the animal
   themselves. Working with Pinto, they found olinguitos in a forest on
   the western slopes of the Andes, and spent their days documenting what
   they could about the animal-its characteristics and its forest home.
   Because the olinguito was new to science, it was imperative for the
   scientists to record every aspect of the animal. They learned that the
   olinguito is mostly active at night, is mainly a fruit eater, rarely
   comes out of the trees and has one baby at a time.

   In addition to body features and behavior, the team made special note
   of the olinguito's cloud forest Andean habitat, which is under heavy
   pressure of human development. The team estimated that 42 percent of
   historic olinguito habitat has already been converted to agriculture or
   urban areas.

   nectar. (Photo by Mark Gurney)

   "The cloud forests of the Andes are a world unto themselves, filled
   with many species found nowhere else, many of them threatened or
   endangered," Helgen said. "We hope that the olinguito can serve as an
   ambassador species for the cloud forests of Ecuador and Colombia, to
   bring the world's attention to these critical habitats."

   While the olinguito is new to science, it is not a stranger to people.
   People have been living in or near the olinguito's cloud forest world
   for thousands of years. And while misidentified, specimens have been in
   museums for more than 100 years, and at least one olinguito from
   Colombia was exhibited in several zoos in the United States during the
   1960s and 1970s. There were even several occasions during the past
   century when the olinguito came close to being discovered but was not.
   In 1920, a zoologist in New York thought an olinguito museum specimen
   was so unusual that it might be a new species, but he never followed
   through in publishing the discovery.

   Giving the olinguito its scientific name is just the beginning. "This
   is the first step," Helgen said. "Proving that a species exists and
   giving it a name is where everything starts. This is a beautiful
   animal, but we know so little about it. How many countries does it live
   in? What else can we learn about its behavior? What do we need to do to
   ensure its conservation?" Helgen is already planning his next mission
   into the clouds.

****OLINGUITO FACTS****

   The olinguito is the smallest member of the raccoon family. It has
   thick, woolly fur that is denser and more colorful (orange or reddish
   brown) than its closest relatives, the olingos. Its head and body
   length is 14 inches long (355 mm), plus a tail 13-17 inches in length
   (335-425 mm), and it weighs 2 pounds (900 grams). Males and females are
   similar in size.

   DIET:     The olinguito mainly eats fruit, but may also eat some
   insects and nectar.

   BEHAVIOR:     These solitary animals live in trees and are mostly
   nocturnal. It is an adept jumper that can leap from tree to tree in the
   forest canopy. Mothers raise a single baby at a time.

   HABITAT:     The olinguito is found only in cloud forests of the
   northern Andes Mountains

   RANGE:     Ecuador and Colombia, at high elevations  (5,000 to 9,000
   feet above sea level).

       It bothers me that the article states that a new species was
       "discovered." This little guy has been around for a while; long
       enough to be included in zoo exhibits. It may be better to say that
       the ancestry of this carnivore had now been better identified, so
       as to lead to a better taxonomic classification. Just a thought.
          + Jenny
            Agreed. I think "identified" is more accurate than
            "discovered".
          + Anonymous
            At least they didn't say it was invented...

            It bothers me that anyone could have a reactiOn to this
            article other than: AWWWWWWWW A MIX BETWEEN A HOUSE CAT AND A
            TEDDY BEAR!!!!! MAY I KISS IT?
          + Freida Alass
            They should just update the name of the order. Carnivora is a
            poor choice. The other order names describe their groups
            better.
               o Curly Locks
                 Can you give us some examples of the other Orders and
                 their common names?
          + Claire
            I was really annoyed that it wasn't the zookeepers that
            noticed that this was a different animal. I would be
            interested in knowing the differences between the Olingos and
            the Olinguitos. How did it get passed so many for so long? And
            was it really THAT different from the behaviors of the
            Olingos? I think it is absurd that they are saying discovered,
            as if it is a great thing, when they should be saying we
            screwed up and mis-categorized an animal. I find it similarly
            annoying that if a word is used/ pronounced incorrectly for a
            long enough period, the definition of the word changes :/
     * Liz
       They keep calling it a carnivore. I do not think they know what
       that word means.
          + J.C.
            There are more then one meanings to the word carnivore. It can
            be used as a descriptive term to describe organisms that eat
            meat. However, it can also be use as a taxonomic term to
            designate something belongs to the group Carnivora (the group
            that includes dogs, cats, bears, raccoons, weasels, and other
            related animals). The olinguito is a carnivore in the second
            sense.
            It can, admittedly be be quite confusing. There are numerous
            carnivores (in the sense of meat eating animals) that are not
            part of the group Carnivora (think of all the lizards, snakes,
            and birds of prey that aren't even mammals!). There are also
            some carnivores (in the sense of animals belonging to
            Carnivora) that don't eat meet (the giant Panda would be
            another famous example).
            Sometimes I think Taxonomic names are chosen just to be
            obtuse. . . .
               o Manduh
                 Thanks for clarifying, I was confused until now.
          + Freida Alass
            It's been driving me nuts since I was a kid, bottom line it's
            a poor name choice for that order. They could come up with
            something better and less confusing. The other orders have
            better names than this one. I'm surprised the classification
            system hasn't been updated after all these years.

            This baby is a member of the Procyonid family; the coffee-bean
            muncher belongs with the Viverrids - so the beans are safe!
     * Sue in Montana
       Great career-builder for the scientist. Too bad the animals
       themselves will be exterminated as they are taken for fur, mothers
       are killed so their babies can be exported as pets, and their
       habitat is destroyed for development. They were hiding for a
       reason.

       Blame Carl Linnaeus (23 May[note 1] 1707 - 10 January 1778), he's
       the one that came up with the binomial nomenclature. and is the
       father of taxonomy. Nobody said it was easy but it STILL should be
       taught at least at the 6th grade level.

     * Heljo Valter
       The olinguito is founded only so big time now! Ou! Interesting to
       see and read too!
     * Chris S
       Correct me if I'm wrong - the article title states that the
       Olinguito is a new species of carnivore. The article then goes on
       to say the creature eats mainly fruit and occasionally insects.
       Would that not make it an omnivore since a carnivore eats meat
       exclusively?
       Whilst it's interesting that this creature can now be reclassified,
       can we be sure that other statements made in this article are
       accurate?
          + Tame'owL
            No carnivore eats meat exclusively.
               o Mac
                 Some carnivores do eat meat exclusively, obligate
                 carnivores. Facultative carnivores eat and can digest
                 plant matter.
                    # Tame'owL
                      While they may consume small amounts of plant
                      material, they lack the
                      physiology required for the efficient digestion of
                      vegetable matter and,
                      in fact, some carnivorous mammals eat vegetation
                      specifically as an
                      emetic.
          + Laura E. McRae
            Hi Chris,
            You are correct that an animal that eats both plant-based and
            animal-based foods would be considered an omnivore. However, I
            think you may be a little confused by how the terms
            "carnivore" and "Carnivora" (note the "a" on the end instead
            of an "e") are different.
            The generic term "carnivore" denotes any animal that eats
            other animals, primarily in the form of prey. Therefore,
            snakes, alligators, some types of lizards, hawks, owls, cats,
            etc. are all carnivores. Similar terms are herbivores
            (plant-eaters), omnivores (plant and meat eaters),
            insectivores (insect eaters), piscivores (fish eaters),
            granivores (grain eaters), etc.
            "Carnivora", on the other hand, is a scientific term (or
            taxonomic classification) for a group of closely related
            animals that all share a common ancestor in their evolutionary
            past. All species assigned to the Order Carnivora are
            genetically related, have similar morphology (biological
            traits), and are more closely related to each other than they
            are to members of other taxonomic Orders, such as Rodentia
            (rodents) or Primates.
            While most members of the Order Carnivora are meat-eaters -
            hence the name, other species in this order have evolved away
            from exclusive carnivory. For example, many bear species are
            omnivores, but the panda (bear) is completely herbivorous.
            Procyonids (raccoon-like species) are generally omnivores with
            some species consuming vast quantities of fruit, like
            olinguitos.
            So, the olinguito species is a member of the Order Carnivora
            because it is closely related genetically to other species in
            that order. However, it has evolved away from carnivory toward
            a more frugivorous (fruit-eating) "life-style".
               o Dan
                 Chris is right, Title has an e, not an a.
                    # Dan
                      Also, carnivore is written without an a or capitol C
                      in the article. That would mean meat-eater, not
                      member of the Order Carnivora on two counts. Double
                      typo, or science fail?
                         @ Laura E. McRae
                           Thanks Dan, I can definitely see the points
                           that you are making. The article does use the
                           more common term "carnivore" instead of
                           Carnivora. It is not unusual when speaking or
                           writing outside of strict scientific circles
                           for authors and scientists alike to use the
                           more common lay term "carnivores" to refer to
                           the Order.
                           Annoying and confusing, I know, but what can we
                           do. Many words in the English language have
                           more than one meaning depending on their
                           context.
                           So, is the olinguito a carnivore? Yes, the
                           olinguito can correctly be called a carnivore,
                           as a member of the Order Carnivora; however, it
                           is carnivore that isn't carnivorous.
                           The take away message here is that not all
                           carnivores (i.e. members of the Order
                           Carnivora) are, in fact, meat-eating.

       Hola, soy Arley Esquivel, quiero compartir con ustedes que
       revisando sus estudios y viendo los medios informativos acerca del
       olinguito; quiero contarles que en mi pueblo Naranjal en el valle
       del Cauca cerca a Cali colombia, creo tener una de estas mismas
       especies, ya que comparándolas, son muy similares.
       Estaré en espera de Cualquier respuesta sobre el tema a mi Mail
