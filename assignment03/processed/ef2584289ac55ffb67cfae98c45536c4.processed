   The defining novel of the 1950s ‚Beat Generation‚ (which Kerouac
   named), On the Road is a semiautobiographical tale of a bohemian
   cross-country adventure, narrated by character Sal Paradise. Kerouac‚s
   odyssey has influenced artists such as Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, and Hunter
   S. Thompson and films such as Easy Rider. On the Road has achieved a
   mythic status in part because it portrays the restless energy and
   desire for freedom that makes people take off to see the world.
