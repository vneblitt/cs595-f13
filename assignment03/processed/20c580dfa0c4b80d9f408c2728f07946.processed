Have Questions About Divorce?: Ask Sesame Street's Abby Cadabby!

   When going through a divorce or separation, parents and children have a
   lot of questions. Young children are often confused and parents are
   often uncertain of how to explain such a challenging transition. On top
   of that, if parents and children have questions, it's not always clear
   where they should look for answers.

   Luckily Sesame Street's Abby Cadabby and her friend Rocio Galarza,
   Senior Director of Outreach and Content Design for Sesame Workshop, are
   here to help. On Wednesday, February 20, Abby and Rocio will be taking
   questions about divorce and separation from parents, children, friends
   and anyone who has questions about staying resilient while navigating a
   divorce or separation.

   Email us at [35]divorce@sesame.org and Abby and Rocio will record an
   answer to your question in a video segment that will be posted online
   next week. In addition to your question, please include your name, age
   (if you wish) and your hometown so we can give say hello if your
   question is picked. We will also write you back directly if Abby and
   Rocio have the opportunity to answer your question.

   Let your friends, family and colleagues know too! Everyone is welcome
   to send in a question. We can't wait to hear from you.
