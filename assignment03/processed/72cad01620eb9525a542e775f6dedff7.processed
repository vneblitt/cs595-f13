Medicaid expansion happy surprise for Colorado man

   DENVER--He makes just $10,000 a year as a clinical professional
   counselor, so Morgan Kinney decided to spend what little extra money he
   had this year paying down student debt rather than buying health
   insurance.

   The 31-year-old Denver man figured he would have no choice but to buy
   insurance next year to comply with the new federal health insurance
   mandate, so last month he entered his personal information into the
   online calculator of the Colorado insurance exchange.

   Yet instead of a cost estimate, he received a rejection notice saying
   he was not eligible to shop on the exchange.

   "I was telling my girlfriend, 'This thing is broken, it won't let me
   in,' and she looked and said, 'I think it's because you're supposed to
   be on Medicaid.' I said, 'No, that's for poor people.' Well, sure
   enough, that was me."

   Colorado is one of at least 24 states expanding Medicaid access for
   adults under the Affordable Care Act. In Colorado, that means single
   adults who earned less than $15,400 last year will have access to
   Medicaid. Childless adults in the state currently qualify for Medicaid
   only if they make less than $95 a month. Colorado estimates about
   160,000 people will be added to state Medicaid rolls under the new
   guidelines.

   Medicaid expansion is a major plank of the administration's plan to get
   every American covered by health insurance. But the U.S. Supreme Court
   last year limited the federal government's ability to penalize states
   that decide against the expansion, leading to a patchwork of Medicaid
   eligibility standards. The Congressional Budget Office has projected 11
   million Americans will get coverage through the Medicaid expansion by
   2022.

   Kinney said he feels incredibly fortunate to live in a state where he
   will receive basic coverage through the government program. He has seen
   firsthand just how expense medical expenses can be.

   He broke his leg last April in a car accident heading home from a
   cross-country skiing trip. But the other driver was at fault, sparing
   Kinney from having to pay the hefty medical bills for his treatment.

   Kinney said he is thankful every time he sees the tab for his care:
   $500 for the ambulance ride; $150 just to consult with a doctor by
   telephone; $100 for a pill.

   "Even though I know I'm going to get my bills paid, it's incredibly
   scary watching the number of zeros on the letters that roll in saying
   these are the bills we owe," said Kinney, who is working part-time
   while his girlfriend finishes medical school.

   He is just beginning his career with a startup counseling company and
   expects to increase his earnings significantly in the years ahead.

   For now, though, Kinney said he is happy to be caught in the Medicaid
   safety net because Colorado opted for the expansion. The cost will be
   covered entirely by the federal government for the first few years,
   with that share eventually falling to 90 percent.

   He wants a checkup and maybe a trip to the dentist.

   "Until now, I've used delusion and denial to pretend something wouldn't
   actually happen to my health," Kinney said. "So now it's nice to think
   about actually having coverage. It didn't click when I saw all the
   'Obamacare' stuff on the news; it was just people yelling at each
   other. ... It was just politics. Now it feels real."
