Orange Is the New Black: A Reading List by Stevie Feliciano, Hudson Park
Library August 6, 2013

   Orange Is the New Black is the latest series from Netflix based on
   Piper Kerman's [127]memoir of the same name. The main character, Piper
   Chapman, is a middle class woman who has to leave behind her life in
   order to serve 15 months in prison for transporting a suitcase full of
   drug money for an international drug smuggler/former lover.

   Piper and other characters such as Tastyee, Red and Alex are seen
   reading or referencing various books throughout the series. I decided
   to watch Orange Is the New Black a second time in order to compile a
   list of the books that are visible in a scene or explicitly referenced
   to. Feel free to add any I may have missed in the comments.

   [128]City of Thieves by David Benioff

   [129]Born to Run by Christopher McDougall

   [130]The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls

   [131]Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire by J.K. Rowling

   [132]Ulysses by James Joyce

   [133]Freshman Year & Other Unnatural Disasters by Meredith Zeitlin

   [134]Emma by Jane Austen

   [135]Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen

   [136]Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James

   [137]The Help by Kathryn Stockett

   [138]1,000 Places to See Before You Die by Patricia Schultz

   [139]Les Miserables by Victor Hugo

   [140]The Tao of Pooh by Benjamin Hoff

   [141]Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn

   [142]Night Shift by Stephen King

   [143]The Complete Illuminated Books by William Blake

   [144]Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank

   [145]Eat Pray Love by Elizabeth Gilbert

   [146]This Is Where I Leave You by Jonathan Tropper

   You can also check out the Tumblr [147]Books of Orange Is the New Black
   and Buzzfeed's latest article "[148]All Of The Books Referenced On
   Orange Is the New Black" to see Tastyee's quotable lines about Harry
   Potter, screenshots of Red reading of the YA book Freshman Year & Other
   Unnatural Disasters and Alex reading City of Thieves and The Glass
   Castle.

[151]Another book...

   Submitted by Erika on August 7, 2013 at 8:25 AM.

   Piper is also seen reading "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn, it shows her
   reading the book when she is out in the "yard" reading by the tree when
   she discovers the chicken for the first time. It also shows the book
   when she is in her cell with her new roommate, the black woman whom
   everyone thinks is a murderer (I forget her name right now). The reason
   I remember this is, at the time, I was reading the same book (which
   turned out to be an outstanding book!). Just thought I would add this
   comment, but I appreciate the books that you have listed and will look
   into reading some of them in the near future. I loved the Netflix
   series "Orange is the New Black" and I'm quite bummed that I didn't
   know there was literature to this show- or I would have most definitely
   read it first.

   Thanks!

[153]Plenty: Vibrant Recipes from London's Ottolenghi

   Submitted by Emily on August 8, 2013 at 4:28 PM.

   The spine of "Plenty" by Yotam Ottolenghi featured prominently in
   Piper's yuppie kitchen flashback during the episode where she is
   starving in prison. What other cookbooks have viewers noted?

[157]Kerman's memoir

   Submitted by Jenny on August 13, 2013 at 10:55 AM.

   The book references different books than the show. Has anyone found or
   made a list of these?
     * [158]reply

[159]That is a great question! I

   Submitted by Stevie Feliciano on August 15, 2013 at 2:34 PM.

   That is a great question! I am currently on the hold list for Piper's
   memoir. I'll make sure to make notes of the books she mentions.

[161]Not from the book, but

   Submitted by becarella on August 19, 2013 at 12:24 PM.

   Not from the book, but there's a post on Piper's prison website on the
   top 10 reads at Danbury Federal
