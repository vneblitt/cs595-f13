Prospective students jockey for positions at veterinary college in record
numbers

   of eight scenarios that will test their non-cognitive abilities.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., Feb. 13, 2013 - After rising to the top of a highly
   competitive application pool and braving last month's snowstorm to make
   their best impression in a selective interview process, prospective
   students find out in early March whether they'll have the opportunity
   to spend the next four years at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College
   of Veterinary Medicine.

   A record-breaking 1,220 prospective students submitted applications to
   the veterinary college last fall, representing the fourth largest
   applicant pool in North America, according to figures from the
   Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges.

   For several years in a row, the college has seen gains in application
   numbers for its [160]Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program, up 11
   percent this year alone.

   "Candidates from all around the country are applying to the
   Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine," said Dr.
   Jacque Pelzer, director of admissions and student services. "Not only
   are we getting the word out more, we are also reaching out to students
   through social media. We are learning how to connect with the
   generation that's applying to veterinary school."

   According to Pelzer, this year also marks the first that the college
   has engaged younger faculty members in the recruitment process. Once
   they reach the interview stage, prospective students interact with many
   different groups associated with the college, including faculty
   members, students, alumni, and practitioners in nearby states who
   volunteer their time as interviewers.

   "During my visit I was struck by how wonderfully welcoming and
   informative the people are and how impressive the college is," wrote
   one candidate after the interview.

   Student ambassadors gave candidates and their families tours of the
   college, including the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. They also
   participated in a dinner with all of the interviewers and interviewees.

   "As student ambassadors, not only do we introduce visitors to our
   program and facilities, but we also strive to get them as excited about
   the college as we are," said Melani French of Manassas, Va., a
   third-year veterinary student and student ambassador. "In order to do
   this, we take the time to truly make their visit an experience as
   opposed to simply `just a tour.' "

   Like some medical colleges, the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of
   Veterinary Medicine utilizes a multiple mini-interview format to assess
   a candidate's non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, problem
   solving, communication, ethics, and leadership. All interviewees
   participate in eight scenarios, which last six minutes each, and rotate
   through interview rooms for evaluation of how they respond to the
   scenarios.

   "Keeping us in the dark about the kinds of questions we would be asked
   and the specific qualities that were being evaluated for made it easy
   to give genuine, natural answers to each scenario," wrote another
   candidate.

   The 273 candidates who interviewed with the veterinary college are
   vying for 120 seats in the Class of 2017. Of these, 50 will be from
   Virginia, 30 from Maryland, six from West Virginia, and 34 from other
   states and countries.

   "There are about 6,000 prospective students who apply to North American
   veterinary schools through a common application process," said Dr.
   Jennifer Hodgson, associate dean for professional programs, who
   explained that candidates apply to five schools on average. "This means
   that we see one out of every six applications in North America."

   Hodgson added that the interview process also affects how candidates
   perceive the college. "They have an opportunity to meet our faculty and
   students and see the facilities that we have," she said. "Our job is
   not just finding the best students, but also convincing these
   applicants to come here."

   The college was the first in the United States to adapt the multiple
   mini interview format developed at McMaster's Medical School in Canada
   for use in a veterinary program. Today, four other veterinary schools
   use the format. With the arrival of the Class of 2017 in August, every
   veterinary student at the college will have made it through the new
   interview process.
   The [161]Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine is a
   leading biomedical teaching and research center, enrolling more than
   500 Doctor of Veterinary Medicine students, master of public health,
   and biomedical and veterinary sciences graduate students. The college
   is a partnership between the land-grant universities of Virginia Tech
   and the University of Maryland. Its main campus in Blacksburg, Va.,
   features the Veterinary Teaching Hospital and large animal field
   services which together treat more than 79,000 animals annually. Other
   locations include the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center in
   Leesburg, Va., and the Gudelsky Veterinary Center in College Park, Md.
