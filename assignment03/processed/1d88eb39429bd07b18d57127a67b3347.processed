   Compost is organic material that can be added to soil to help plants
   grow. Food scraps and yard waste currently make up 20 to 30 percent of
   what we throw away, and should be composted instead. Making compost
   keeps these materials out of landfills where they take up space and
   release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

   All composting requires three basic ingredients:
     * Browns - This includes materials such as dead leaves, branches, and
       twigs.
     * Greens - This includes materials such as grass clippings, vegetable
       waste, fruit scraps, and coffee grounds.
     * Water - Having the right amount of water, greens, and browns is
       important for compost development.

   Your compost pile should have an equal amount of browns to greens. You
   should also alternate layers of organic materials of different-sized
   particles. The brown materials provide carbon for your compost, the
   green materials provide nitrogen, and the water provides moisture to
   help break down the organic matter.

            - Might contain substances harmful to plants
          + Dairy products (e.g., butter, milk, sour cream, yogurt) and
            eggs*
            - Create odor problems and attract pests such as rodents and
            flies
          + Diseased or insect-ridden plants
            - Diseases or insects might survive and be transferred back to
            other plants
          + Fats, grease, lard, or oils*
            - Create odor problems and attract pests such as rodents and

          + Meat or fish bones and scraps*
            - Create odor problems and attract pests such as rodents and
            flies
          + Pet wastes (e.g., dog or cat feces, soiled cat litter)*
            - Might contain parasites, bacteria, germs, pathogens, and
            viruses harmful to humans
          + Yard trimmings treated with chemical pesticides
            - Might kill beneficial composting organisms
            * Check with your local composting or recycling coordinator to
            see if these organics are accepted by your community curbside
            or drop-off composting program.

Benefits of Composting

     * Enriches soil, helping retain moisture and suppress plant diseases
       and pests.
     * Reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.
     * Encourages the production of beneficial bacteria and fungi that
       break down organic matter to create humus, a rich nutrient-filled
       material.
     * Reduces methane emissions from landfills and lowers your carbon
       footprint.

How to Compost at Home

   There are many different ways to make a compost pile; we have provided
   the following for general reference. Helpful tools include pitchforks,
   square-point shovels or machetes, and water hoses with a spray head.
   Regular mixing or turning of the compost and some water will help
   maintain the compost.

Backyard Composting

     * Select a dry, shady spot near a water source for your compost pile
       or bin.

     * Add brown and green materials as they are collected, making sure
       larger pieces are chopped or shredded.

     * Moisten dry materials as they are added.

     * Once your compost pile is established, mix grass clippings and
       green waste into the pile and bury fruit and vegetable waste under
       10 inches of compost material.

     * Optional: Cover top of compost with a tarp to keep it moist. When
       the material at the bottom is dark and rich in color, your compost
       is ready to use. This usually takes anywhere between two months to
       two years.

Indoor Composting

   If you do not have space for an outdoor compost pile, you can compost
   materials indoors using a special type of bin, which you can buy at a
   local hardware store, gardening supplies store, or make yourself.
   Remember to tend your pile and keep track of what you throw in. A
   properly managed compost bin will not attract pests or rodents and will
   not smell bad. Your compost should be ready in two to five weeks.

Build Your Own Indoor Bin

     * Drill half-an-inch diameter holes in the bottom and sides of a
       plastic garbage can. The size of the garbage can depends on how
       much compost you'd like to make.

     * Place a brick in the bottom of a larger garbage can, surround the
       brick with a layer of wood chips or soil, and place the smaller can
       inside on top of the brick.

     * Wrap insulation around the outer can to keep the compost warm and
       cover the cans with a lid.
