       The White House
       Office of the Press Secretary
       For Immediate Release
       August 29, 2013

FACT SHEET: New Executive Actions to Reduce Gun Violence

       Today, the Obama administration announced two new common-sense
       executive actions to keep the most dangerous firearms out of the
       wrong hands and ban almost all re-imports of military surplus
       firearms to private entities. These executive actions build on the
       23 executive actions that the Vice President recommended as part of
       the comprehensive gun violence reduction plan and the President
       unveiled on January 16, 2013.
       Even as Congress fails to act on common-sense proposals, like
       expanding criminal background checks and making gun trafficking a
       federal crime, the President and Vice President remain committed to
       using all the tools in their power to make progress toward reducing
       gun violence.
       Building on the 23 Executive Actions the President and Vice
       President Unveiled Last January
          + Last December, the President asked the Vice President to
            develop a series of recommendations to reduce gun violence. On
            January 16, 2013, they released these proposals, including 23
            executive actions. With the first Senate confirmation of an
            ATF Director on July 31, 2013, the Administration has
            completed or made significant progress on 22 of the 23
            executive actions. The new executive actions unveiled today
            build on this successful effort.
       Closing a Loophole to Keep Some of the Most Dangerous Guns Out of
       the Wrong Hands
          + Current law places special restrictions on many of the most
            dangerous weapons, such as machine guns and short-barreled
            shotguns.  These weapons must be registered, and in order to
            lawfully possess them, a prospective buyer must undergo a
            fingerprint-based background check.
          +  However, felons, domestic abusers, and others prohibited from
            having guns can easily evade the required background check and
            gain access to machine guns or other particularly dangerous
            weapons by registering the weapon to a trust or corporation.
            At present, when the weapon is registered to a trust or
            corporation, no background check is run.  ATF reports that
            last year alone, it received more than 39,000 requests for
            transfers of these restricted firearms to trusts or
            corporations.
          + Today, ATF is issuing a new proposed regulation to close this
            loophole.  The proposed rule requires individuals associated
            with trusts or corporations that acquire these types of
            weapons to undergo background checks, just as these
            individuals would if the weapons were registered to them
            individually.  By closing this loophole, the regulation will
            ensure that machine guns and other particularly dangerous
            weapons do not end up in the wrong hands.
       Keeping Surplus Military Weapons Off Our Streets
          + When the United States provides military firearms to its
            allies, either as direct commercial sales or through the
            foreign military sales or military assistance programs, those
            firearms may not be imported back into the United States
            without U.S. government approval.  Since 2005, the U.S.
            Government has authorized requests to reimport more than
            250,000 of these firearms.
          + Today, the Administration is announcing a new policy of
            denying requests to bring military-grade firearms back into
            the United States to private entities, with only a few
            exceptions such as for museums.  This new policy will help
            keep military-grade firearms off our streets.

            In this week's address, President Obama says that on October
            1st, a big part of the Affordable Care Act will go live and
            give uninsured Americans the chance to buy the same quality,
            affordable health care as everyone else. It is also the day
            when some Republicans in Congress might shut down the
            government just because they don't like the law.
