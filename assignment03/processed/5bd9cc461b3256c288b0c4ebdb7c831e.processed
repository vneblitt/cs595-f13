                            Reform Criminal Justice

   Our criminal justice system doesn't do our society justice. Add your
   name and join our fight to improve public safety, save taxpayer money,
   and empower Americans by reforming our criminal justice system now.

   My petition to Congress:

   For too long, the priorities of our criminal justice system have been
   backward.

   We have valued punishment over rehabilitation for low-level,
   non-violent crimes, and we have done so at the expense of public
   safety, human dignity, our budget, and the economic vitality of our
   communities and of our nation. We must fundamentally reevaluate our
   criminal justice system.

   I ask you to put justice back in our criminal justice system by
   fundamentally reevaluating why and how we convict and incarcerate --
   and the best ways we can empower people who have been incarcerated to
   succeed once they rejoin society.
