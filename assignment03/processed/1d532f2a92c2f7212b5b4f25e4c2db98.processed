Chief Keef -- Ordered to Jail ... For Blowing Off Child Support

   [29]Celebrity Justice
   9/12/2013 8:40 AM PDT [30]BY TMZ STAFF
   Chief Keef
   Ordered to Jail
   For Blowing Off Child Support
   Exclusive
   0911_chief-keef_getty
   Police in Chicago have been told to haul Chief Keef's deadbeat ass to
   jail ... if they see him ... after the 17-year old rapper blew off a
   child support hearing, TMZ has learned.
   We broke the story ... Keef was ordered to appear in court  on
   September 5 to explain why he hasn't forked over more than $20k in
   child support payments to his baby mama.
   Problem is ... Keef no-showed -- so the judge issued an order for his
   arrest, which means if cops see his ass, they can drag him right to the
   slammer and hold him until he pays roughly 1/5th of his child support
   debt.
   We know [31]he can afford it -- but it's unclear why he's refusing to
   pony up. Attempts to reach Keef for comment were unsuccessful.

   You guys keep talking like this kid makes a ton of money- $120K (a
   little over his reported annual income) isn't all that much, especially
   for a rapper who spends thousands on chains, clothes, and making sure
   that he keeps a months salary in his pocket. Thinking he would have 20K
   in the bank so that he could cut a check for child support is
   ridiculous.

   you said it in the first line. He's a dead beat.
   Just another black man not taking care f his children. Its not like
   that's a epidemic in this country. Oh wait it is. Hey Chief Queef why
   not try to be a role model for the black community and be there for
   your kids. Actually take care of them and raise them, Just think how
   much you wanted dad growing up. Your kids want a father too. To bad
   your to big f piece of crap to even care for you own kids. Hope he dies
   horribly so his kids inherit all his money and wont have a chance to
   know what a piece of dung their father truly is.

   He's dead broke, and when they catch him he won't be able to make bail.
   The money he flashes around is just given to him by his record company
   so he can pose with it.....it's not his.

   TMZ. . . the worst thing to happen to the journalism world. Can you not
   write real sentences? Is objectivity too much for you to handle?
   "Police in Chicago have been told to haul Chief Keef's deadbeat ass to
   jail" it's just terrible writing and I sincerely hate what you do.

   Not that this is important, but he's actually 18! Still, if he's not
   paying for his kid he deserves to be punished.
