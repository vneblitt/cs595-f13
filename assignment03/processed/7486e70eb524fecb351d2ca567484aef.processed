     * [128]U. of I. president's contract extended

   By Jodi S. Cohen Tribune reporter

   4:55 p.m. CDT, September 12, 2013

   University of Illinois President Robert Easter will receive a $90,000
   bonus payment for his performance during the past year, bringing his
   total compensation this year to $552,375.

   University of Illinois President Robert Easter will receive a $90,000
   bonus for his performance during the past year, bringing his total
   compensation to $552,375.

   The payment marks the first time a U. of I. president will receive
   bonus wages on top of his base salary, a practice more common in the
   corporate world than in academia and one designed to put a greater
   emphasis on performance rather than longevity.

   The bonus, which trustees unanimously approved during their board
   meeting at the Urbana-Champaign campus Thursday, is to be paid within
   30 days. Board members did not comment publicly on their decision. He
   had been eligible to receive up to $100,000.

   "It signals to Bob how impressed we are with his leadership but also
   lets everyone know there is still work to be done," U. of I. board
   Chairman Christopher Kennedy said in an interview after the board's
   vote.

   The board decided on the $90,000 amount after trustees ranked Easter's
   progress toward the goals set last year.

   Last month, Easter also received a merit-based salary bump of 2.75
   percent, the average increase for university employees, bringing his
   base salary to $462,375.

   Kennedy defended the bonus while acknowledging that some may frown on
   it at a time when the university is coping with less financial support
   from the state and also trying to keep tuition increases relatively
   small. The board approved a $4.45 billion budget for this year, a 1.2
   percent increase from last year.

   "There isn't an institution with this size budget being led by someone
   making anything as little as what he makes," said Kennedy, referring to
   corporations and prominent universities.

   Kennedy has endorsed raising the president's salary to make it more
   competitive with those of other Big Ten universities when the U. of I.
   looks to recruit the next president.

   Easter, 65, who has spent his entire career at the U. of I., took over
   as president of the three-campus university system last year when
   former President Michael Hogan stepped down after months of
   controversy. The U. of I. board voted in July to extend Easter's
   contract through June 2015.

   The average salary for public university presidents in 2011-12 was
   about $440,000, according to a survey by the Chronicle of Higher
   Education. The top 10 earners made more than $800,000.

   Easter's salary is still less than the $651,000 that Hogan made as
   president. When he was appointed president, Easter said he thought he
   was being paid the appropriate amount.
