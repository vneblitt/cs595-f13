University expands sports concussion-risk studies to include hockey and

   BLACKSBURG, Va., Jan. 29, 2013 - The [160]Virginia Tech-Wake Forest
   University School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences is expanding
   its ground-breaking research of testing football helmets to reduce the
   number of concussions to now include hockey, baseball, softball, and
   lacrosse.

   The five-year plan will see the Virginia Tech research center, headed
   by [161]Stefan Duma, rate helmets worn by hockey, baseball, softball,
   and lacrosse athletes in their ability to lessen the likelihood of a
   concussion resulting from a violent head impact.

   Ratings on hockey helmets are expected in fall 2013, followed by youth
   football in 2015, and then baseball, softball, and lacrosse in 2016.
   During that time, all ratings for adult and youth football helmets will
   continually be updated and released to the public.

   The expansion into helmeted sports other than football comes on the
   heels of new research that allows for better prediction of
   sports-related concussions resulting from linear and rotational head
   accelerations.  These accelerations result from head impacts that cause
   the head to translate and twist about the neck. The new research is
   published this month in the [162]Annals of Biomedical Engineering. (The
   peer-reviewed study is available online for [163]free download from the
   journal.)

   The new research is being funded  by Virginia Tech, the National
   Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Institutes of
   Health, and the [164]Institute for Critical Technology and Applied
   Science at Virginia Tech.

   New ratings for football helmets will include data for linear and
   rotational accelerations starting in 2015, said Duma, professor of
   biomedical engineering and department head of the Virginia Tech-Wake
   Forest University School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences.
   Serving as lead author on the research paper is [165]Steven Rowson,
   assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Virginia Tech.

   "All head impacts result in both linear and rotational accelerations,
   and this publication provides the foundation for our research to
   address both accelerations relative to reducing the risk of
   concussion," said Duma. "Our goal with the five-year plan is to provide
   manufacturers with a schedule detailing when we will release helmet
   ratings for each sport."

   The helmet rating system is based on more than a decade of data
   collection by Duma and his research staff, and utilizes the STAR, or
   Summation of Tests for the Analysis of Risk, formula that assesses the
   ability of football helmets to reduce concussion risk.  Sport-specific
   testing methodologies will be added to the website that lists the rated
   helmets prior to the initial release of each sport's helmets ratings.

   Using data collected from more than 63,000 head impacts during a period
   of 10 years, Duma and Rowson related linear and rotational head
   acceleration to the probability of sustaining a concussion in the form
   of an injury risk function.

   "This new analysis utilizes data measured from 62 concussions sustained
   by high school, college, and professional football players," said
   Rowson. "We use these data to determine the best method to predict
   concussions when we test helmets in our laboratory."

   In their research paper, the researchers write, "With as many as 3.8
   million sports-related concussions occurring annually in the United
   States and research suggesting possible long term neurodegenerative
   processes resulting from repetitive concussions, reducing the incidence
   of concussion in sports has become a public health priority."

   Indeed, long-term, repetitive injuries that can cripple or eventually
   kill years after play have prompted dozens of headlines on
   [166]Duma'[167]s work in major media outlets and several other national
   studies, and even President Barack Obama to recently weigh in on the
   subject. Dozens of former NFL players are suing the league over
   injuries sustained during years of play, and headlines were made this
   summer when former football great Alex Karras died at age 77 from
   various ailments, several said to be allegedly caused by years of hard
   hits.

   In studying football-related injuries during the past decade, Duma and
   his research team have used on-field real-time sensors installed in the
   helmets of [168]hundreds of adult and youth football players to study
   injuries, as well as a mechanical lab-tested 5-star rating system to
   track and grade commercially sold helmets.

   The former can help indicate head injuries that require immediate
   attention while on the field of play. The latter has provided the only
   independent biomechanical data for consumers to make helmet purchasing
   decisions, Duma said.

   Duma's goal is not to end the sport of football, but make it safer
   while still keep the same expected adrenaline rush and action for
   players, and viewers.

   "It is important to note that no helmet can prevent all concussions.
   The most effective strategies to reduce concussions in sports involve
   modifying league rules and player technique to limit exposure to head
   impacts," Duma said.

   "Beyond this, head impacts are a given in sport. Our research focuses
   on identifying helmets that reduce concussion risk so that athletes can
   make informed decisions based on independent data when purchasing
   equipment, which in turn, incentivizes helmet manufacturers to design
   helmets that better reduce head acceleration."

   The [169]Virginia Tech - Wake Forest University School of Biomedical
   Engineering and Sciences is a joint graduate program, formed in 2003,
   which brings together three prestigious academic institutions: the
   [170]College of Engineering at Virginia Tech, the Wake Forest School of
   Medicine, and the [171]Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary
   Medicine. Each of these separate entities contributes unique strengths
   to the combined enterprise so that students are offered a wide spectrum
   of first-class educational and research opportunities. School of
   Biomedical Engineering and Sciences students and faculty on the
   Blacksburg campus are part of the [172]Institute for Critical
   Technology and Applied Science.
   The School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences partnership between
   Wake Forest and Virginia Tech is resulting in visionary research which
   will ultimately advance discovery in human engineering and other
   critical technologies related to human health and the practice of
   medicine.
