       When the first part of the bill was put in place, I had a one year
       teacher aid position. I was allowed to continue health insurance
       coverage after the job ended.

[83]David W., Sioux Fall, SD
       At age 74, I think I'm sufficiently covered by Medicare and a
       supplement package. However, one never knows what life
       circumstances lie ahead.
       Beyond my personal situation, I believe that we as a nation should
       truly be ''our brothers (and sisters) keepers.'' Consequently,
       Obamacare gets us one step closer to becoming a moral society.

       I have two adult children with pre-existing conditions.Â  I worry
       less now.
     * [86]Bob L., Tulsa, OK

[87]Bob L., Tulsa, OK
       I am under-employed (less than 20 hours/week) and receiving SSDI.
       Because I am on SSDI I qualify for Medicare. I have a pre-existing
       chronic terminal illness and am taking approximately $5,000/month
       in medications. My out-of-pocket medical expenses (after my
       Medicare HMO) were approximately $800/month prior to Obamacare.
       This year, because of the changes to the donut hole brought by
       Obamacare, my expenses have dropped to less than $300/month. This
       has allowed me to become more self-sufficient and buy the gas
       necessary to get to and from my two jobs, and the groceries I need
       each month.
       Prior to this, I was relying heavily on local churches and food
       banks and even my state to assist with utility costs, gasoline, and
       food.

[89]Steven M., Stillwater, OK
       I can now afford health insurance. I also know that I'm getting
       good insurance. I had a coworker on a company sponsored plan at my
       former employer who ended up with $20,000 of out of pocket health
       care expenses after his wife had abdominal surgery. She could not
       work for 6 months because of the surgery. We were not making more
       than 20-24K/yr driving the company trucks! It would also make a
       difference if my state's governor would expand Medicaid
       eligibility, but she won't do it. As a result, I could lose my
       health insurance if I become unemployed.

[91]Lindsey P., Seattle, WA
       I am currently unemployed due to lay-off and am struggling to pay
       the bills without an income. Not having to worry about paying for
       birth control is a welcome benefit that is helping me during this
       hard time.

       Without this, I wouldn't have insurance. Without insthat saves my
       life if I eat something that sets off my food allergy. Should that
       be reserved for people that can afford to pay $400+ a month for
       health insurance?
     * [94]Kim T., Arlington, VA

[95]Kim T., Arlington, VA
       I wouldn't have health insurance if not for the extension of
       student benefits under their parents' plan.

[97]Tammy M., La Crosse, VA
       My husband is our soul bread winner. I am not working and Obamacare
       helps with one less paymentâ¦Everything is much more costly today
       and it's bad when you have low income.

[99]Douglas Y., Staunton, VA
       I am 81 years old and I know the Affordable Health Plan will be
       around for my grandchildren who are in lower middle class income
       families. I also believe that this unique plan will serve the
       nation in a time when health care costs are rising. I only hope
       that the President can overcome the political opposition and
       ignorance of those opposed to this fine plan.

[101]Anna B., North Salt Lake, UT
       My granddaughter Isabella was born in March 2012 with Down Syndrome
       and an AVSD heart defect, requiring hundreds of thousands of
       dollars' worth of open-heart surgery, feeding tube surgery, ear
       surgery and several hospitalizations.
       Because she could not be denied coverage for a pre-existing
       condition, her parents were able to purchase health insurance for
       Isabella, saving her family from bankruptcy and financial ruin.Â
       We are so grateful for Obamacare!

[103]Laura C., Arlington, TX
       After surviving two bouts of breast cancer, insurance companies can
       no longer refuse to cover me. In the past I have gone for years
       without health insurance. I was self employed and every insurance
       company I applied to denied me coverage. Obama care gives me hope
       for my future.
     * [104]Shannon W., Austin, TX

[105]Shannon W., Austin, TX
       Had Obamacare been in existence when I graduated from college, I
       could have benefited from being able to remain on my parents'
       insurance plans. Instead, I was forced to live without healthcare
       for 4 years.
       Thankfully, IÂ now am insured. EVERYONE has the RIGHT to affordable
       access to healthcare.
     * [106]Susan D., Maryville, TN

[107]Susan D., Maryville, TN
       As a physician I have always taken my health insurance for granted.
       After an episode of early breast cancer and a sudden move into a
       practice of my own, I found out I am uninsurable for any amount of
       money because of this pre-existing condition. The new healthcare
       law has relieved me of the fear of bankruptcy if my breast cancer
       returns.
     * [108]Jessica R., Hendersonville, TN

[109]Jessica R., Hendersonville, TN
       I have the ability to ensure that I can care for my current child
       by having access to free birth control. I also don't have to worry
       about my brother losing his health care because of his pre-existing
       condition.

[111]Benay G., Charleston, SC
       Obamacare is working for me because it is working for so many
       uninsured Americans.Â  We are fortunate to have medical insurance
       but so many people do not.Â  Obamacare works for America!Â
       Affordable healthcare works for America.

[113]Donna M., Wakefield, RI
       Obamacare works for my 2 young adult children (21 and 23) who both
       had ACL surgery months apart. With one still in college and the
       other starting his adult life, the surmountable bills of surgery
       and rehab would have left them destitute.

       I am a single mom with a low income and having access to free
       family planning helps to control a female medical condition I

       My husband is 66 years old and wants to retire. I am 61. He is
       working so I can have insurance. I have lupus and cannot work. I
       have been too ill to work long enough to get SSD.
       In January he can get Medicare and I can get Obamacare. He can
       retire! Also my 20 yr old granddaughter can stay on her father's
       insurance.

       My 20 yr old daughter is a full time college student working a part

[127]Eliza B., Brooklyn, NY
       I am a freelance artist who teaches privately and as adjunct
       faculty at two different colleges. I am proud to say that I've made
       my living as an artist, but acquiring health insurance as a
       freelancer has always been a challenge.
       The ACA is making it possible for me and other freelancers like me
       to get the coverage we need at a rate we can pay. Where I could
       only afford indemnity insurance before, I will soon be able to buy
       full coverage for about the same price, chosen by me from a wider
       selection of insurance companies.
     * [128]Teresa V., Albany, NY

[129]Teresa V., Albany, NY
       Because it works for my daughter. She is 28 years old and was JUST
       eligible for health care via NYS.Â  However, she is fortunate
       enough to have landed a steady job making more money which will
       make her no longer eligible for the state insurance.
       A step forward yet a step back.Â  Her steady job does not offer
       health insurance for their associates at her level. Obamacare will
       be there for her and for that I am grateful.

[133]Gabrielle A., NV
       Obamacare has had a huge, positive impact on my life. Instead of
       having to pay $900 a year in birth control to prevent pregnancy, I
       pay $0. That's an extra month's worth of student loan payment.
     * [134]M.K.G., Vadito, NM

[135]M.K.G., Vadito, NM
       I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. In January I will be
       eligible to have insurance again because they cannot discriminate
       against me, based on a pre-existing condition. (NM has red flagged
       me for insurance, because of a cancer diagnosis even though I had a
       bilateral mastectomy to alleviate this condition.) I have no way to
       get any gyno care without the existence of Planned Parenthood â¦

[139]Julia C., Mt Laurel, NJ
       I have MS. Before, I was constantly worried that I would be dropped

       As a new mom, I want to do everything I can to help my baby be
       healthy. Now that the Affordable Care Act has kicked in, I am able

       breast milk even after I go back to work! Obamacare is helping me
       keep my baby, and myself, healthy.

[143]Ginny S., Henniker, NH
       In September, I will be working 2-3 jobs yet I will not have access

       affordable health care act, I will have access to affordable care.

[145]Ira J., Lincoln, NE
       As a military veteran I am blessed to have access to the VA Health
       Care System and it provides me with peace of mind.Â  Why shouldn't
       every American have this same access and peace of mind of knowing
       that they and their families will not be forced into bankruptcy or
       have to choose between health care, rent, food or medicines.
       Let's also not forget this fact:Â  The elected officials who have
       voted 40 times to repeal Obamacare have tax payer subsidized health
       care for themselves and their familiesâ¦.

[147]Debbie H., Omaha, NE
       I'm very much in favor of the Affordable Care Act - this is such a
       rich country, we should provide medical care for everyone who can't
       afford it - it says a lot that isn't pretty about us that we don't
       do that. But I don't have much personal experience with Obamacare
       because I'm a senior on Medicare and haven't had to use it yet.

       I just had a baby 4 weeks ago.Â  I was able to get a breast pump at
       no cost through my health insurance thanks to the ACA.Â  Breast
       pumps are very expensive and I probably wouldn't have been able to
       afford a double electric pump on my own.Â  Because I have one, I am
       able to pump and freeze breast milk so I can better feed my
       daughter in the future (when I return to work).
       I am so thankful for this!

       I can now get my OB/GYN exams with no co-pay. I also need birth

       I have had health insurance for the last 19 years, but until last
       year, it had been at least 7 years since I had had a
       wellnessÂ checkup or mammogram because I couldn't afford it.
       Since it is now mandatory for the insurance to cover these costs I
       have been able to have those tests without additional cost to me.Â
       Thank you President Obama.Â  Also the fact that the insurance
       companies now have a cap on their profits is a bonus.

       My wife and I are self-employed and in our early 50s. Over the last
       five years, our health insurance premiums have risen about 10%
       annually.
       This year, for the first time I can ever recall, our health
       insurance premiums are not rising at all! As documented in other
       places (e.g. New York State), Obamacare is finally bringing
       insurance industry premiums under control and making it affordable
       for people like us to remain insured.

       As an educator in rural Maine, who works with a special education
       population I have seen many students over the years who, along with
       their families, did not have access to health care. Now they will
       have the opportunity to receive the care they all so desperately
       need.

[175]Martha H., Takoma Park, MD
       We were able to keep our 25 year old son on our insurance while he
       completed an internship and worked in other low-paying jobs that
       gave him the experience he needed to land a good job with benefits
       in his chosen field.
       Also, I am retired now because of health reasons but not yet old
       enough for Medicare.Â  The ACA will allow me to buy insurance to
       bridge the gap between my COBRA coverage and Medicare, despite my
       pre-existing conditions.

       I'm lucky enough to have excellent insurance coverage that is
       well-subsidized by my employer, as well as access to a Healthcare
       Savings Account. However, I no longer have out-of-pocket expenses
       related to birth control since my generic brand is covered under my

       I am able to get blood tests without copayments.Â  I have
       hypothyroidism and need to take blood tests periodically in order
       to keep my thyroid level at the right place.Â  I am also able to
       take mammograms, well women's care checkups and an annual physical
       without a copayment.Â  My birth control medicine that allows me to
       regulate my menstrual cycle also has no copayments.
       I did the math not long ago and I save well over $200 a year thanks
       to Obamacare.Â  When I recently saw my pharmacist for a refill and
       we noticed the lack of a copayment, I commented to the pharmacist,
       ''Thank you, Mr. President!'' and she agreed wholeheartedly.Â  To
       sum it all up I am grateful to you, Mr. President, for working hard

       diligently trying to find work in their areas of interest and have
       part-time jobs.Â  Fortunately, they are able to get health
       insurance through their parents' plans because of Obamacare.

       My son will turn 25 in a couple of days. He works outside and has
       gotten poison ivy/oak/sumac with a vengeance several times a year.
       Without the ACA he would be paying for all those ER visits himself.
       The ACA let him stay on my medical insurance, so he could go to the
       ER and get treatment for those incredibly awful bouts of poison
       ivy.
       When he turns 26 he'll be able to join the insurance exchanges at a
       rate that a young healthy adult can afford.

       I work on the board of The Family Health Centers in Louisville
       Kentucky and we have been gearing up with great excitement since
       the earliest notions of ''Obamacare''. It works for me because at
       last health care will work for everyone.
       We are family centered and our patients are quite often quite
       poor.Â  We provide care no matter what and it is a joy to watch
       health care givers that go about their work with real joy and
       commitment.Â  They have much to be proud of....and we are thrilled
       with the notion that everyone, rich or poor, will be treated with
       grace, competency and the understanding that all of us are entitled
       to a decent health care system in this great country of ours.

       It is because I am a Chaplain in a large Catholic Hospital and have
       seen people who came in and died because they did not have any
       money or insurance to go to a Doctor. Also I want all of those who
       do not have insurance to be able to have Health Care.
       I lived in England and had three children, the health care there
       was so good and we need that for our country.

       My daughter has had endometriosis since age 14. After she turned 22
       it was a burden to pay her monthly prescriptions & Dr.âs
       appointments.
       Obamacare helped tremendously from age 24-26. Plus the
       pre-conditions made it impossible for her to get her own insurance.

       My son died because Obama care was not yet available.
       The insurance companies denied him because he had a pre-existing
       condition.Â  I used up all the money I had, all the value of my
       home, and all of my retirement pension trying to help him, but when
       the money ran out, he died.Â  He was only 49.

       We were able to cover our daughter even though she was older and
       even though she had a ''pre-existing'' condition.Â  She had
       leukemia as a 7th-grader, then relapse in her junior year.
       This delayed her start in college so normally she would have had to
       find her own coverage at 23, but because the age changed to 26, we
       were able to keep her on our policy as she finished college.
       Also she would have had trouble finding a policy, as a cancer
       survivor, but now she cannot be discriminated against because of
       this.

       I think it's silly that we are one of only a few developed nations
       in the world that donât offer universal health care coverage for
       its citizens.
       Further, medical costs in the United States are much higher
       compared with other developed countries, so a universal health care
       system with many participants would give the government more
       leverage to control health care costs.

[223]Janny K., Milford, DE
       I've been disabled since 2006 with chronic low back/leg pain. My
       medical expenses were running almost $12,000 annually until the ACA
       began to close the Medicare Part D payment gap. This year I
       estimate expenses of about $6,500, and am encouraged that they will
       be less and less as the payment gap closes.
       I was close to bankruptcy before the ACA I'd downsized and cut
       every possible expense.Â  Like many, I was jeopardizing my health
       by skipping doses, splitting pills and my nutrition was poor.
       I'm now able to eat properly and can afford (mostly) the medication
       that I need to be minimally functional.Â  Knowing this will improve
       with the ACA gives me light at the end of the tunnel of despair and
       pain.

       Both my 20 and 24 year olds have been able to stay on my health

       job but my insurance is better and by staying on my plan he takes
       home more money which he then has available to put towards paying
       off student loans.
       I also am able to avail myself of a heath care FSA through my job
       and Obamacare which helps me save money on taxes and gives me more

       insurance companies continue to profit off of people, especially
       since they arbitrarily deny people medications and services for no
       reason other than increasing their bottom line?
       Why is being a woman considered a pre-existing condition? Why

       imagine being all of 9 years old and NEVER being able to get
