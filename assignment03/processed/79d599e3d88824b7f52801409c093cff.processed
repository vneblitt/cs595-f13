   BLACKSBURG, Va., Jan. 30, 2013 - The [160]Association of Collegiate
   Schools of Architecture has recognized [161]Donna Dunay, G.T. Ward
   Professor of Architecture in the [162]College of Architecture and Urban
   Studies, with the 2012-13 Distinguished Professor Award.

   The prestigious national award is only presented to four professors
   annually in recognition of their achievements in teaching, design,
   scholarship, research, or service.

   "This award acknowledges the contributions that Professor Dunay has
   made to advancing architectural education in both academic and
   professional arenas. In particular, she has demonstrated outstanding
   leadership through the integration of critical knowledge evidenced in
   her teaching, community service, and research. Her capacity for
   significant contributions to and through the students in her design
   studio and her `What Makes a Town' course have been outstanding,
   leaving a three-decade legacy of excellence that stands as a tribute to
   the profession," said Jack Davis, Reynolds Metals Professor of
   Architecture and dean of the College of Architecture and Urban Studies.

   The Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture encompasses more
   than 250 schools and 5,000 architecture faculty in the United States
   and Canada. The Distinguished Professor Award will be presented during
   the association's 101st annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif., on
   March 22.

   Dunay received her master's and bachelor's in architecture from
   Virginia Tech, and has been teaching in the [163]School of Architecture
   + Design at the university since 1975. She is one of a distinguished
   few to be named an American Institute of Architects Fellow, an honor
   only 2 percent of professionals in that organization attain.

   Her areas of specialty include research on design studies, urban
   design, architecture, and community identities as well as product
   design and production. She explores cultural and civic understanding in
   practice through design research, and her work has gained a wide
   audience through her leadership as chair of the [164]International
   Archive for Women in Architecture and director of the International
   Archive for Women in Architecture Center.

   Dunay has curated numerous exhibits showcasing the significant works of
   women working in architecture nationally and internationally. In 2011,
   as chair of the International Archive for Women in Architecture, she
   collaborated with the International Union of Architects in presenting
   the exhibit [165]"For the Future: Pioneering Women in Architecture from
   Japan and Beyond In Celebration of 25 years of the IAWA" in Tokyo,
   Japan.

   In addition to her significant professional contributions, Dunay is
   also active in her local community, serving the Town of Blacksburg,
   where she resides, as part of the Arts and Cultural District Committee,
   Townscape Committee, Sixteen Squares ad hoc Study Committee, and the
   Downtown Revitalization Committee.

   Virginia Tech's [166]College of Architecture and Urban Studies is
   composed of four schools: the School of Architecture + Design,
   including architecture, industrial design, interior design and
   landscape architecture; the School of Public and International Affairs,
   including urban affairs and planning, public administration and policy
   and government and international affairs; the Myers-Lawson School of
   Construction, which includes building construction in the College of
   Architecture and Urban Studies and construction engineering management
   in the College of Engineering; and the School of the Visual Arts,
   including programs in studio art, visual communication and art history.
