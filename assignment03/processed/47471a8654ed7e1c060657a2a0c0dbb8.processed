[63]Discovering The Small Miracle Of The Soup Dumpling

   [64]A xiao long bao, or soup dumpling, in a large spoon.

   September 1, 2013 Soup dumplings are a miracle of transubstantiation,
   and the reciprocal of every other dumpling you've had. If they're made
   right, the dough will release the broth and fade away as you snap
   through the meaty filling.

[67]Dumplings Taste Better When Filled With Memories

   [68]Just about every culture has a dumpling. For many immigrants and
   first-generation Americans, dumplings serve as a delicious taste of
   home and heritage. Pierogis are the Polish take on the form.

   August 30, 2013 Just about every culture has dumplings. For the Polish,
   it's pierogi, and as Morning Edition editor Renita Jablonski writes,
   this little dumpling plays a big role for many Polish-Americans in
   preserving and celebrating their heritage.

[85]Our Quest To Build A Great Global Dumpling List

   [86]Khinkali dumplings hail from Georgia and Azerbaijan.

   August 27, 2013 The pot sticker and the ravioli are global superstars,
   but most dumplings are known only regionally. And it's the lesser-known
   examples, like the Cherokee grape and the Russian pelmeni, that show
   how truly universal dumplings are. Help us create a master list.

[89]Tortellini, The Dumpling Inspired By Venus' Navel

   [90]Even in Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus, the
   goddess's belly resembles a plump, firm tortellino.

   August 27, 2013 Legend has it that an innkeeper caught a glimpse of the
   goddess of love in her bedroom and then rushed to his kitchen to create
   an egg pasta inspired by Venus' belly button. Today the art of making
   tortellini is endangered, but several groups are devising creative ways
   to preserve the tradition.

   August 26, 2013 From Warsaw to Wuhan, people around the world love
