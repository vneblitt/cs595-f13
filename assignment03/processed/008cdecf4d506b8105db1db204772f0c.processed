Pentagon Spec Ops Chief Sees '10 to 20' More Years of War Against al-Qaida

   The war in Afghanistan may be winding down. But the Pentagon's chief of
   irregular warfare still sees a war against al-Qaida that will last
   decades, all over the world -- a prospect that prompted astonishment
   and constitutional debate in the Senate.

   Asked at a Senate hearing today how long the war on terrorism will
   last, Michael Sheehan, the assistant secretary of defense for special
   operations and low-intensity conflict, answered, "At least 10 to 20
   years."

   It was just two months ago that the top U.S. intelligence official
   testified that al-Qaida had been [122]battered by the U.S. into a state
   of disarray. A year ago, the current CIA director, John Brennan, said
   that "For the first time since this fight began, we can look ahead and
   envision a world in which the al Qaeda core [123]is simply no longer
   relevant." Just this week, the commander of the Joint Special
   Operations Command, Army Lt. Gen. Joseph Votel, told a Florida
   conference that he was [124]looking at missions beyond the
   counterterrorism manhunt.

   Yet a spokeswoman, Army Col. Anne Edgecomb, clarified that Sheehan
   meant the conflict is likely to last 10 to 20 more years from today --
   atop the 12 years that the conflict has already lasted. Welcome to
   America's Thirty Years War.

   There is no geographic limit to that war, Sheehan and others testified,
   thanks to the seminal law authorizing it in the days after 9/11, known
   as the Authorization to Use Military Force. Thanks to that relatively
   terse authorization, U.S. counterterrorism stretches "from Boston to
   the FATA," Sheehan said, using the acronym for Pakistan's tribal areas.
   Sheehan told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he believed
   "associated forces" of al-Qaida can be targeted anywhere around the
   world, including inside Syria, where the rebel Nusra Front
   [125]recently allied itself with al-Qaida's Iraq affiliate, or even
   what Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) called "boots on the ground in Congo."

   Asked if individuals who were not born on 9/11 but join al-Qaida are
   legal targets for the U.S. military, acting Pentagon chief lawyer
   Robert Taylor answered, "As long as they become an associated force
   under the legal standard that was set out."

   That extensive authority, particularly inside the United States
   prompted a [126]highly publicized protest on the Senate floor by Sen.
   Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in March. Members of the panel expressed shock that
   Sheehan and Taylor envisioned such a broad, long war.

   "You guys have essentially rewritten the Constitution here," said Sen.
   Angus King (I-Maine). King pointed out that the 2001 Authorization to
   Use Military Force against al-Qaida, or AUMF, was specifically bounded
   to avenging the 9/11 attacks, and [127]does not contain the words
   "associated forces" repeatedly invoked by Taylor, the top Pentagon
   lawyer.

   "You guys have invented this term, associated forces, that's nowhere in
   this document," King said. "It's the justification for everything, and
   it renders the war powers of Congress null and void." Sen. John McCain
   (R-Ariz.), expressed incredulity over the Pentagon's broad
   interpretation of the AUMF. "None of us" who voted for the law in 2001
   "could have envisioned [granting] authority [to strike] in Yemen and
   Somalia," McCain said.

   The panel's chairman, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), jumped to the
   Pentagon's defense, saying that "any co-belligerent" was an appropriate
   target under established principles of international law.

   While the Pentagon takes an expansive view of the powers Congress
   granted it under the AUMF, it has resisted for years efforts by
   Congress to revise the document. Taylor's predecessor, Jeh Johnson,
   [128]rejected the House Armed Services Committee's 2011 push to vote on
   an updated AUMF, although more than half of currently-serving
   legislators were not serving when the 2001 law passed. It's unclear how
   much appetite Congress has for revising the AUMF; nor whether such a
   revision would restrict U.S. counterterrorism efforts or expand them
   even further, to target groups or individuals unrelated to al-Qaida.

   The only circumstances under which the administration might need new
   authorities for counterterrorism, Sheehan said, would be if a new
   terrorist group unaffiliated with al-Qaida arose to threaten the United
   States. Sheehan said that he saw that as a mere hypothetical. "Existing
   authorities are adequate for this armed conflict," Taylor reaffirmed
   today.

   [129]Like Johnson did last year, the Pentagon officials also said that
   they saw "a tipping point" whereby al-Qaida is defeated. When that
   happens, the officials testified, the armed conflict against al-Qaida
   will end. ("That day, unfortunately, is a long way off," Sheehan said.)
   Taylor added that such a conclusion to the conflict won't necessarily
   nullify the AUMF. "If the president were to issue a declaration that
   the conflict against al-Qaida has been concluded," he said, "I think
   that would constitute an end," as would a repeal by Congress.

   "I've never seen such an accomplished group of people give such muddled
   answers," testified Rosa Brooks, a former Pentagon policy official.
