Frank Sewell, Mystery Candidate for Mayor

   Posted by [86]Will Sommer on Sep. 11, 2013 at 12:45 pm

   photo (19)

   LL's been seeing these flyers promoting mayoral candidate Frank Sewell,
   and they raise a lot of questions. For example, what's "Honest Next
   Leadership?" And who the heck is Frank Sewell?

   There's not much public information available on Sewell, who previously
   ran in 2004 for the Ward 8 D.C. Council seat. His campaign, such as it
   is, hasn't registered with the Office of Campaign Finance. Maybe
   Rev. Anthony Motley, the Marion Barry [87]chum who's listed on the
   flyer as Sewell's campaign chairman, can explain.

   Or not. "I have no idea what that's all about," says Motley.

   Sewell and Motley are family friends, Motley says, but he never agreed
   to be the chairman for Sewell's "campaign."

   Sewell didn't respond to LL's request for comment, and LL's not holding
   his breath. Consider the Washington Post's [88]take on his 2004 run:

     Another challenger in the Democratic primary, Frank Sewell, has hung
     campaign posters, but he has not been highly visible or responsive
     to requests for information about his candidacy.

   Motley is talking, though, and he's not happy. "I told him to go back
   on the street and take everything that he's distributed--take it off
   the street," he says.
