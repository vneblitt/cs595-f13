Arnold, McGee kick off `Science and Cooking' series

   September 10, 2013 | Editor's Pick

   New York Times columnist Harold McGee used history as his backdrop when
   kicking off the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences' "Cooking
   and Science" lecture series.
   By Valerie Vande Panne, Harvard Correspondent

   Four years ago, "Science and Cooking" was whipped up by the [83]Harvard
   School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and the [84]Alícia
   Foundation in Spain. The wildly popular public lecture series and
   companion course mix the culinary with the lab. World-class chefs and
   Harvard faculty illuminate research through experiments with food.

   On Monday, author and New York Times columnist [85]Harold McGee opened
   this year's series with an aphorism from Jean Anthelme
   Brillat-Savarin's "Physiology of Taste": "The discovery of a new dish
   confers more happiness on humanity than the discovery of a new star."

   McGee dove into the history of science and cooking, starting locally
   with Woburn-born Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford (1753-1814),
   widely considered the founder of kitchen science and the backer of a
   physics professorship at Harvard. It was a Rumford professor, [86]Eben
   Norton Horsford, who gave us, in the mid-19th century, the baking
   powder we find so useful today, McGee added.

   Until recently, McGee said, scientific focus on cooking was always on
   safety, hygiene, and industrial manufacturing (such as how to can clams
   so they don't spoil).

   Among his demonstrations, chef Dave Arnold showed how a "Chinese
   popping machine" was used to puff rice in the early 20th century.

   Today, the study of [87]gastrophysics draws from psychology, culture,
   food structuring, and quantum chemistry, among other disciplines.

   Chef [88]Dave Arnold followed McGee with experiments and a discussion
   of torching, broiling, heat, and flambé. He peppered his talk with
   kitchen tips such as, "Almost everything in the kitchen should be
   [measured] by weight, not volume" (with alcohol being a notable
   exception). He also demonstrated a "Chinese popping machine" to show
   how cereal manufacturers puffed rice in the early 20th century. The
   machine made a loud clang, and had quite a few people in the front rows
   squirming, as if it were about to blow up. Arnold accidently overheated
   the contraption, burning the rice, and then used a long metal stick to
   pry it open. With a startling bang and big puff, plumes of smoke poured
   out and rose in the hall, setting off fire alarms.

   There were cheers and hollers of delight, until someone came in and
   gently reminded the audience the alarms meant they had to evacuate.

   The "Science and Cooking" public lecture series runs through Dec. 9.
   Click [89]here for more information. Beginning in October, the course
   will be offered through HarvardX, the University's online learning
   initiative. Watch the course trailer [90]here.
