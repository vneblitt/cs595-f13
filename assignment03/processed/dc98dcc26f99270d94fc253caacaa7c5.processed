   Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. September 4, 2012 (Transcript Below)
   Jimmy Fallon: The other thing I appreciate and we tweet about this back
   and forth is you are a...might be the biggest Springsteen fan I know.
   You love Bruce Springsteen.
   Governor Christie: I do. I do.
   Jimmy Fallon: You just saw him last night.
   Governor Christie: Yes in Philly.
   Jimmy Fallon: And what number show is this?
   Governor Christie: It was my 130th show last night.
   Jimmy Fallon: This guy is...I mean wow.
   Governor Christie: Well it started when I was 13 and I'm going to be 50
   so that's a lot of years but...
   Jimmy Fallon: Did you start back in Asbury Park or where...
   Governor Christie: First show I saw him at was Seton Hall University in
   the Walsh Gym in...it was 1975.
   Jimmy Fallon: Gosh. So I know exactly who you are by the way because
   I've been to Springsteen shows. You're the guy that screams all the
   words louder than Bruce Springsteen behind me. Pumping his fists, yeah.
   Governor Christie: Yes. Absolutely.
   Jimmy Fallon: That's you, yeah. Like what...can you give us a little
   taste?
   Governor Christie: I was doing it last night.
   Jimmy Fallon: Could you do a little Thunder Road or something?
   Governor Christie: Me and you? Yeah let's do it.
   [Jimmy Fallon and Governor Christie sing Thunder Road by Bruce
