Secrets of Whale Shark Migration Revealed

The world's biggest fish travels far and wide, a tracking study shows.

   Published August 21, 2013

   The world's biggest fish are hungry migrators on a mission, according
   to a tracking study that mapped [125]whale sharks' long journeys around
   the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean to a favorite feeding hot spot off the
   Yucatan Peninsula.

   And one whale shark's incredible 5,000-mile (7,200-kilometer) swim
   could even help solve the long-standing mystery of where whale sharks
   give birth--an event no scientist has ever seen.

   The largest-ever study of whale shark migrations, nine years in the
   making, shows that the hundreds of school bus-sized animals that feed
   in a plankton-saturated stretch off the Mexican coast come from far and
   wide.

   The gentle giants--which can reach up to 40 feet (12 meters) or longer
   in length, and weigh an average of 5 tons--use mouth filters to feed on
   the tiny plankton and small fish or eggs.

   Whale sharks are known to gather at a dozen major feeding locations
   around the world, from western Australia and Indonesia to Belize. But
   between May and September, the waters of Mexico's Quintana Roo state,
   on the northeastern [126]Yucatan Peninsula, draw far more animals than
   other spots and attract an estimated 800 or more in a given season.

   "From this one feeding area, these animals spread out over vast parts
   of the region--throughout the Gulf of Mexico, down into the Caribbean
   Sea, through the Straits of Florida up into the open Atlantic Ocean,"
   said study co-author[127] Robert Hueter, director of the[128] Center
   for Shark Research at Mote Marine Laboratory. "We found animals coming
   back for as many as six years at a time. Clearly they are returning to
   this site to fuel up on the rich food that's there to carry them
   through much of the rest of the year."

   (Related pictures:[129] "Biggest Whale Shark 'Swarm' Found.")

   Analyzing the Data

   The reliable numbers and accessibility of whale sharks at the site
   prompted Hueter in 2003 to begin accumulating the nine years of tagging
   and satellite tracking data that formed the backbone of the recent
   study by the Mote Marine Lab and Mexico's[130] National Commission of
   Natural Protected Areas.

   The amount of time invested, and data collected, by the study's authors
   is nothing short of phenomenal, said whale shark researcher[131] Mike
   Maslanka, the Head of Department of Nutrition Science at Smithsonian's
   National Zoo in Washington, D.C.

   "The summer work we do [at feeding aggregations] is just a tiny
   snapshot in the life of a whale shark," he said. "These tagging efforts
   allow us to discover more about what happens when they aren't gathering
   to feed in the summer. Without the tagging we wouldn't even have a
   glimpse into that part of their lives. That's the really cool part of
   this study."

   Maslanka added, "These things are so big, to think that they
   'disappear' is pretty amazing. It's the largest fish in the ocean and
   we don't know where it goes for six months of the year."

   (The whale shark research was partially funded by a grant from the
   National Geographic Society.)

   Birthing Mystery Solved?

   Among more than 800 individuals studied, one animal stood out.

   A mature and presumably pregnant female called Rio Lady was tagged and
   then tracked along an odyssey of some 4,800 miles (7,800 kilometers),
   which ended when her tag came off after five months of observation.

   "She just kept going," Hueter said. "She swam out between Brazil and
   Africa until she passed the Equator, and that's where her tag came
   off."

   But her journey, and other whale shark sightings in the remote region,
   could help answer a question that has plagued whale shark researchers
   for years: Where are all the females? Quintana Roo is more than 70
   percent male, and other global aggregations show the same gender
   imbalance.

   "You can't have a stable population with that many males. You don't see
   that in nature," Hueter said.

   "The females have to be somewhere, and we hypothesize that mature,
   pregnant females undergo long migrations to the middle of the ocean,
   near seamounts or remote islands ... and that's where they give birth,"
   Hueter explained. "In coastal zones where the feeding aggregations are,
   their young-which are less than two feet long at birth--might be
   subject to higher predation."

   He added, "We feel good about the hypothesis, but it's out there to be
   tested. So now we'll have to see if it's proven right in the years to
   come."

   Few very young whale sharks have been seen in nature. And discovering
   where the animals give birth, Maslanka said, is "the holy grail of
   whale shark biology." [132](Related: "Smallest Whale Shark
   Discovered--On a Leash.")

   But the story isn't as simple as finding out what area or areas they
   use to pup. The find would lead to greater understanding of basic whale
   shark biology, much of which is still lacking because so much of the
   animals' lives are lived out of our sight.

   "And from the perspective of ecosystem management, we'd want to make
   sure that area was protected over time so they could continue to pup in
   an unmolested state," he said.

   Protecting the Gentle Giants

   Using this study and others to determine where the animals travel,
   feed, and reproduce is key to protection of a species that is becoming
   increasingly beloved by ecotourists and others. (See[133] video of
   divers swimming with a whale shark.)

   "It's the largest fish in the ocean, and it's a real representative of
   healthy marine ecosystems," Maslanka said. "It can be a real flagship
   species for protecting the oceans, especially in the band that
   stretches around the Equator."

   But as Hueter's group makes clear, conservation of the far-roaming
   animals will take international cooperation because whales spotted in
   one area may depend, in other seasons, on resources located many
   hundreds of miles away.

   And while mating remains a mystery, whale shark genetics suggest that
   animals swap genes among far-flung geographic locales, and that only
   two large metapopulations exist--one in the Atlantic and another in the
   Indo-Pacific.

   Each population requires management on a broad scale. The species as a
   whole is currently listed as vulnerable on the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [134]Red List of Threatened Species and
   is still hunted for fins and oil in some Asian waters. (Related:[135]
   "Whale Sharks Killed, Displaced by Gulf Oil?")

   Hueter said he's encouraged that whale sharks can be protected by the
   process that's already begun, notably in his study area, with the
   Mexican government's designation of a Whale Shark Biosphere Reserve in
   the feeding aggregation grounds.

   There's more work to be done, he cautioned, but the species definitely
   warrants the effort.

   "This is the largest fish that has ever lived, and it's charismatic,"
   Hueter said. "It poses no danger to people who love to see it and swim
   with it in the wild. It might be the largest animal on the planet that
   you can be close to in it's natural environment and not be in any
   danger whatsoever."

   Thanks NG. The continued existance of these beautiful,
   vulnerable creatures, like that of the wild elephant, is imminently in
   our hands. Let's hope we find ways to respectfully co-habit this
   earth for the benefit of their offspring and ours.

   I wonder how such a big animal keep its life a secret. But pollution
   may be killing the plankton on which it depends for food.I hope they
   will survive into the future.

   I'd prefer that we look at the dolphins migration off the coast of VA
   here in the US so that we can once and for all determine if Corexit is
   the cause of the mass die off of the dolphins that's been happening
   since 2010.

   I have a better idea. Leave the sharks alone with their privacy,
   instead of letting everyone in the world know where they go and where
   they give birth. They may last longer. U-U

   I live on the west coast of Mexico in a town called Puerto Escondido
   and have lots of friends who scuba and free dive. They always have
   stories about the amazing wildlife they see while diving, and about two
   weeks ago, a friend told me how he saw whale sharks swimming 200 meters
   from shore at a place called Punta Colorada.

   Unfortunately, Punta Colorada is being threatened by an independent
   project to put in a large wharf that will host cruise ships and large
   fishing boats.

   Not only does this take away jobs from the local fishermen, but it
   leads to over fishing and added pollution. Not to mention, the
   beautiful reef with all its wildlife will be covered in concrete.

   If you love whale sharks, the ocean, and the beaches and ecosystems
   that come with keeping the area clean, natural, and healthy, please
   sign this petition.

   Thank you,

   When I was in the Galapagos, the dive guides said that almost all of
   the whale sharks they see (and all of the ones I saw) are females.  And
   most of them are very large both in length and in girth and it is
   thought that they are pregnant.

   - how do they navigate in time and space to be able to return to the
   feeding location at the same time of the year ?

   - how do they learn to go there ?

   The new information on this gentle giant is captivating to our
   knowledge. Just wanted to note that they also appear at least once a
   year in our central Pacific Ocean during the Summer. Out here when they
   show up Fishermen that are fortunate to run into them always make good
   tuna catches as they lured bait fish that attracts tuna.
