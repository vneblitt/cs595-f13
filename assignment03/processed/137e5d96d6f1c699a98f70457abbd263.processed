Head Start Cuts Services For More Than 57,000 Children Due To Sequestration

   WASHINGTON -- Head Start, the federal pre-K education service for
   low-income families, has eliminated services for [276]more than 57,000
   children in the coming school year as a result of the federal budget
   reductions known as sequestration.

   The cuts include a shorter school year and shorter school days, as well
   as laying off or reducing the pay for more than 18,000 employees
   nationwide. Others eliminated medical and dental screenings and bus
   routes.

   The latest numbers, [277]first reported by the Washington Post, come
   from "reduction plans" Head Start grantees submitted to the Department
   of Health and Human Services. Head Start had to absorb a 5.27 percent
   reduction to its [278]$8 billion in funding.

   All told, 57,265 children (nearly 6,000 of whom attend Early Head
   Start) saw their services eliminated, according to data provided to The
   Huffington Post by HHS. The state to take the biggest hit was
   California, where 5,611 Head Start kids were denied a spot in the
   program. In Texas, that number was 4,410. In New York it was 3,847. But
   underscoring just how widespread the effects of sequestration have been
   felt, even smaller states were impacted. In North Dakota, Head Start
   eliminated 194 slots in its program. In Rhode Island, it cut 450
   positions. Even in far-flung Hawaii, 72 Head Starts slots were slashed.

   Head Start is best known for providing preschool to low-income
   students, but it supplies many of its 960,000 children with two hot
   meals a day, transportation to and from school and basic medical care.
   When these services are eliminated, it also affects parents, who often
   must find difficult-to-afford day care services or take off days of
   work to tend to their children. HHS data says that Head Start will have
   administered 1,342,015 fewer days of service nationwide because of
   sequestration cuts.

   Starting on Monday, Head Start will be holding [279]events in
   congressional districts around the country -- while lawmakers are home
   for recess -- to raise awareness of sequestration's harmful effects.
   Supporters will be lining up empty child-size seats or cribs in front
   of Head Start buildings to show how many children will be losing out.

   "[280]Child care can cost $540 a month. And if you are 200 percent
   below the poverty line, then you are going to have a hard time
   providing that," Dr. Barbara Coatney, executive director of the Gulf
   Coast Community Action Agency, which oversees eight Head Start centers,
   told The Huffington Post. "Some of the poorest children in Mississippi
   won't be able to get child care through Head Start because of
   sequestration."

   All part of the plan I'm sure.  The continual merry-go-round for the
   middle class and the poor while the wealthy are exempt from all that is
   happening.  We have a situation where children will be behind in their
   education, we have children that will eat less or improperly because
   they are unable to get the meals provided while they are attending
   school, also too, we will have children that will [319] Read More...
   not be screened for disease or maybe not properly immunized because
   parents simply can't afford child care all  of the extra things that go
   along with the depriving them of the help our government has been
   giving corporations in order for them to be able to exploit the parents
   while the children are at school.   So now, what will happen?  Will we
   wait the corporations can figure out how to exploit the taxpayer by
   offering privatized head start programs that will be run to their
   specifications with government dollars?  Will this be the way they try
   to get in on the ground floor of education while claiming to be
   providing a service?  Will this be the manner in which the government
   eventually begins funneling more taxpayer dollars to the wealthy,
   through privatization as they have prisons and other government run
   facilities?  I wonder.....Guess we will have to stay tuned.

   I hate to say it but I volunteered at a headstart. and all the kids did
   everyday was color and play with blocks. I saw so many mother's that
   didn't hold a job drop off their child just to be free. The teacher
   that taught there went into the hospital and never came out (41 a
   husband and father). My son was at the doctor office constantly from
   picking up germs from the sick kids or it could have been the rug they
   sat on everyday. I taught/challenged my son with his spelling and math.
   He has been on the Honor roll (Gifted Program) straight A's since 9 y/o
   and now 13 and will be taking AP classes to prepare him for AP High
   school classes. Teaching begins at home.

   I am surprised when liberals who support immigration, work visas,
   student visas, trade with slave labor dictatorships (like China), and
   amnesty for illegals...they support ALL these policies that offshore
   jobs, suppress wages, raise costs for tuition...and then they expect us
   to spend more and more on the poor THEY helped to create!
   So you offshore my job then want to keep taxing my labor to pay for the
   poor which YOU profit from creating?!

   Studies have shown that headstart is little more than babysitting. My
   daughter was in headstart, and trust me she learned more at home from
   her big sister who was 3 grades ahead of her when they played school.
   That being said, when are people interested in finding common ground?
   We both want kids to have a good start at school, and there are better
   ways than government funded programs. Why does no one who supports
   Obama think he should spend less on his vacations, and revoke
   tax-breaks to companies like farming corporations and oil companies.
   Who doesn't agree that companies should win or lose on their own merit?
   All everyone wants to do is argue with the other side.

   You would of made good points towards the end, but trotting out the
   vacation crapola just shows that you are parroting the company line.
   Your post also does not mention that you pulled your child out of the
   program early, so I must conclude that what was good for your family is
   no longer ok for others, because you got yours.
