   By Rich Campbell, Tribune reporter

   8:54 p.m. CDT, September 14, 2013

   Former Bears running back Rick Casares died Friday at his Florida home,
   the Tampa Tribune reported. He was 82. Casares was a member of the
   Bears' 1963 NFL championship team, which coincidentally is being
   honored at halftime of Sunday's game against the Vikings at Soldier
   Field.

   Casares, who played for the Bears from 1955-64, led the NFL in rushing
   in 1956. He played in five Pro Bowls.

   He was the Bears' all-time leading rusher with 5,657 yards until Walter
   Payton surpassed him in 1979. He still is the third-leading rusher in
   club history.

   "He was he toughest guy I ever played with," former Bears tight end and
   coach Mike Ditka told the Tampa Tribune. "I remember him playing on a
   broken ankle. On the field, he was all business. Off the field, he was
   a real sweetheart.''

   Casares fondly remembered his playing career during an interview with
   the Chicago Tribune in 2010 upon his induction into the Italian
   American Sports Hall of Fame.

   "The best years of my life were in Chicago," he said. "I loved being
   there and playing for the Bears from the first day I got there."

   The Bears drafted Casares in the second round in 1954. He told the
   Chicago Tribune in 2010 that he believed he could have run for 10,000
   yards if owner/coach George Halas had not changed the offensive scheme
   in 1961 and traded quarterback Ed Brown.

   Casares didn't like the changes and he told legendary Bears beat
   reporter Ed Stone, then of the Chicago American, of his
   dissatisfaction. Stone said it was the first time anyone remembered an
   active player publicly criticizing Halas.

   Casares retired to Tampa, Fla., where he liked to fish. He was
   remembered for his prolific career at Jefferson High School and the
   University of Florida. He was named in 2007 to the Florida High School
   Athletic Association's All-Century Team.

   Football took a major toll on his body. He had two knee replacements,
   an ankle replacement and a shoulder replacement. He also had wrist and
   rib surgeries. He estimated he suffered six severe concussions and told
   the Chicago Tribune this year that he was starting to get forgetful.

   He died peacefully, drifting off to sleep in his den, his wife, Polly,
   told the Tampa Tribune. He reportedly wanted to attend Sunday's
   ceremony at Soldier Field but did not feel well enough to make the
   trip.
