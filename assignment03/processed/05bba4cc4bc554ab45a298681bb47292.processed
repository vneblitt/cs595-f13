Entomologists promote prevention as a defense against bed bugs

   Bed bugs are natural parasites of people, evolving with human
   populations for the past 35,000 years. Insecticides developed in the
   20th century nearly eradicated bed bugs from developed nations, but
   since the early 2000s, population growth and increased international
   travel, as well as mounting pesticide resistance, have brought bed bugs
   back with a vengeance.

   "There are not a lot of cost-effective options for dealing with them.
   And because they are so highly resistant to the pesticides we use for
   their control, they are spreading faster than ever," said Dini Miller,
   urban pest management specialist for [83]Virginia Cooperative Extension
   and associate professor of entomology in the [84]College of Agriculture
   and Life Sciences.


   Associate Professor Dini Miller, at left, and master's student Molly
   Stedfast Associate Professor Dini Miller, at left, and master's student
   Molly Stedfast are studying bed bugs and teaching people how to manage
   infestations in homes and businesses.

   Miller and her colleagues at the Virginia Tech [85]Dodson Urban Pest
   Management Laboratory began investigating bed bugs in 2004 by studying
   pesticide resistance and new approaches to their control. A large part
   of their work involves teaching people how to manage bed bug
   infestations in homes and businesses. In addition, Miller works with
   home health care workers, social services, apartment and shelter
   managers, and school facilities personnel to raise awareness.

   Miller's team is focusing on the growing bed bug problem in multi-unit
   housing complexes, particularly those whose tenants have limited
   resources. "Elderly and disabled residents are particularly vulnerable
   to bed bugs. They may not be able to see them or to defend themselves
   against receiving hundreds of bites a night," Miller said.

   Bed bugs are a nightmare for housing managers.

   "When bed bugs get into the walls, they can spread from unit to unit,
   so instead of one unit being infested, multiple units may be infested
   within a period of months," Miller said. Some apartment complexes have
   seen their pest management costs increase by $30,000 or even $100,000
   in one year. "We are working with apartment complexes to get them to
   invest in a prevention program to keep bed bugs from spreading."

   Molly Stedfast of Norfolk, Va., a master's student in [86]entomology
   who works with Miller, said, "Our research is based on the idea that if
   we can teach people easy, inexpensive, nonchemical methods they can use
   to better protect themselves from bed bugs, we can reduce the problem
   overall."


   Bed bugs All life stages of the bed bug are visible to the naked eye.
   Adults are flat and about 4 to 5 millimeters long, about the same shape
   and color as an apple seed. Immature bed bug nymphs are translucent and
   yellowish in color and about 1.5 millimeters long, about the size of a
   comma in a paperback book.

   Stedfast has traveled to several locations affected by bed bugs,
   including Harrisonburg and Richmond, Va., and New Orleans. At each
   apartment complex, she uses simple methods to train staff members and
   residents to recognize and safely prevent bed bug infestations.

   In her presentation to the apartment staff, Stedfast demonstrates how
   to apply diatomaceous earth -- a nontoxic dust made from fossilized
   remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae -- to the inside
   perimeter of an apartment. The dust has been used as a form of pest
   control for more than 100 years.

   When bed bugs walk through the dust, it clings to their exoskeleton and
   absorbs their wax layer, causing them to die of dehydration, Miller
   said. "We treat the perimeter of the apartment to isolate infestations
   in one unit and not allow them to spread. It is a lot less expensive to
   treat one apartment than every unit in the building."

   "When well-off people get bed bugs, it's an inconvenience. But when
   low-income families get them, there aren't many options," Stedfast
   said. "Those who can't afford the treatments end up living and
   suffering with bed bugs for a long time."

   Sonya-Lee Zezza, social services coordinator at a Richmond apartment
   complex, said the information from training session is important for
   her staff to know. "The presentation for the staff and residents
   reinforced the facts about bed bugs. It was also helpful to be able to
   ask questions and clarify information," she said. "It is very important
   to keep the education ongoing and to clear the myths from the facts.

   "Our partnership with Virginia Tech is a win-win for everyone because
   bed bugs are not going to go away, so we all need to learn and assist
   each other on this sensitive and growing matter," Zezza said.

   Although it is difficult for Stedfast to measure the impact of her
   research and training programs, she said she thinks it has been
   effective in changing the way people think about bed bugs, even if on a
   small scale.

   "Most grad students don't get to see their research actually help
   people face to face," she said. "It's been really great to help people
   all the way from Virginia to New Orleans and to have people from all
   over the country call and ask questions. It makes me feel good about
   what I'm doing. I feel like I'm making an impact."

   multi-unit housing complexes to [89]manage and prevent infestations.

Fact or fiction?

     * Myth: Bed bugs are only found on beds. As natural parasites of
       humans, bed bugs need to live near humans so they can feed. The bed
       is a common place for bed bugs to live because people are
       relatively motionless while sleeping, providing bed bugs with easy
       access to uninterrupted feeding. But they can be found anywhere in
       a home, including ceilings, dressers, couches, wheelchairs, and
       walls.
     * Myth: Bed bugs only bite at night. Bed bugs commonly bite at night
       because they are active at night. But if a bed bug is hungry, it
       has no problem biting at any time during the day or night.
     * Myth: Bed bugs transmit diseases. Bed bug bites can lead to stress,
       anxiety, sleeplessness, and even secondary infections. But a bed
       bug has never transmitted a disease to a human.

Bed bug resources

       Bed bugs

   Information about bed bugs can be found on the [90]Virginia Department
   Agriculture and Consumer Services website.

   Associate Professor Dini Miller created 13 fact sheets about bed bugs
   in English and Spanish. In 2011, the fact sheets were downloaded
   314,000 times. The following year, the number of downloads rose to 1.8
   million.

   The publication "Bed Bugs: How to Protect Yourself and Your Home" is
   available in PDF and ebook format on the [91]Virginia Cooperative
   Extension website.
