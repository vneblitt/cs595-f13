   By John Byrne, Chicago Tribune reporter

   12:02 a.m. CDT, September 14, 2013

   Mayor Rahm Emanuel began last week on David Letterman's couch, telling
   the late-night host and a national TV audience that he wouldn't start
   campaigning for re-election for more than a year.

   Then the mayor returned to Chicago and continued a recent run of
   announcements that could resonate with African-American voters, a key
   group in deciding city elections. Emanuel unveiled plans to eventually
   put a Whole Foods in economically distressed Englewood, apologized for
   the decades-old torture of black suspects led by a notorious former
   police commander and moved to rename a street after a prominent black
   pastor.

   African-Americans overwhelmingly supported Emanuel's first election.
   But a Tribune poll in May found that midway through his term, nearly
   half of black voters disapproved of Emanuel's job performance, up from
   a third a year earlier.

   And that survey came before thousands of children were forced to begin
   attending new schools in many cases farther from their homes because
   the mayor's Board of Education shuttered dozens of schools, mostly in
   black neighborhoods.

   South Side Ald. Willie Cochran said Emanuel is keenly aware of his
   standing among African-Americans and is working to make sure they don't
   think he's taking them for granted.

   "Especially the mayor, who's a professional politician, knows how to
   use polls," said Cochran, 20th. "Every poll I see says he's losing
   support in the African-American community. If he wants to be
   re-elected, he needs to shore that up."

   The Tribune asked the administration about the timing of the mayor's
   recent announcements and why he's taken on these issues. The mayor "is
   constantly doing events in the African-American community, as he is in
   every community of the city," the Emanuel press office responded in an
   email. The recent initiatives are just a few among a number of "major
   events that have a lot of relevance to the African-American community,"
   including the Red Line renovation and spending on parks and
   playgrounds, among others.

   On Wednesday the mayor asked the City Council to rename Stony Island
   Avenue from 56th Street to 130th Street "Reverend Bishop Brazier
   Avenue" in honor of the late Arthur M. Brazier, a revered
   African-American civic leader who founded the Woodlawn Organization and
   was pastor of the Apostolic Church of God in Woodlawn for 48 years.

   Emanuel said he would leave "to the cynics" the question of whether the
   Brazier street-naming was politically motivated to curry favor with
   black voters.

   "If you didn't do it, somebody would say you're slighting somebody. If
   you do it, you're saying it's political," he told reporters.

   Late Friday afternoon, the Rev. Byron Brazier, son of the late pastor,
   called the Tribune and said the mayor's office asked him to "go on the
   record" that he asked the mayor to rename the street this fall to help
   the church's charity raise money from corporations that set their
   donation budgets before the end of the year.

   The street renaming request came a week after Emanuel announced that
   come 2016, a Whole Foods would go up along a once-bustling stretch of
   63rd Street in Englewood. While the mayor posited the high-end grocery
   store as an anchor for a revitalization of the area near Kennedy-King
   College, Cochran wonders whether it's a good fit.

   "There was no community input at all," the alderman said. With other,
   less pricey grocery stores already in the vicinity, many area residents
   had hoped for a Wal-Mart so they could buy clothing and household
   goods, he said.

   Last week also saw Emanuel's apology for the actions of former police
   Cmdr. Jon Burge.

   The mayor previously had been pressed by reporters to say he was sorry
   about the systematic torture of mostly African-American criminal
   suspects by detectives overseen by the former South Side police
   commander during the 1970s and 1980s. Emanuel declined to do so at that
   time, saying he was "focused on the future of the city, not just about
   the past."

   After the City Council on Wednesday approved another settlement for
   Burge victims, $12.3 million for two men wrongly convicted of murder,
   Emanuel offered the apology.

   "Here's what I mean: I am sorry this happened. Let us all now move on,"
   he said during his post-council news conference.

   Ald. Leslie Hairston, 5th, said "it was decent" of Emanuel to throw the
   weight of the mayor's office behind an apology for the Burge torture,
   some of which took place while former Mayor Richard M. Daley was Cook
   County state's attorney.

   "This was something (Emanuel) inherited," Hairston said. "He had
   nothing to do with it, but for him to take that step was the right
   thing to do."

   It was a week that also featured Emanuel introducing Illinois Secretary
   of State Jesse White at the popular African-American statewide
   official's campaign kickoff, as well as a mayoral appearance at a
   ribbon-cutting for a new Wal-Mart store in the Pullman neighborhood.

   Hairston said the mayor is giving the impression he's finally putting
   some energy behind the promises he has made to address the concerns of
   the city's African-American residents. But she said it's going to
   require more work on Emanuel's part for the good feelings to gain
   momentum and coalesce into votes.

   "He really can't count on (African-American) support," said Hairston,
   who indicated the mayor's layoffs of teachers and CTA workers "is
   decimating the African-American middle class in this city."

   "If he wants people to back him, he has to show he's serious about
   dealing with some of our problems out in the neighborhoods, not just
   downtown."
