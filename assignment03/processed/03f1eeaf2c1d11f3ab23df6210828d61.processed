     * [42]Tell climate deniers the threat is real

       In the photo above, OFA Miami volunteers rally to demand action on
       climate change.
       There are currently 135 [45]climate change deniers in Congressâthat
       we know about. If you want a sense of why Congress has failed to
       take meaningful action to combat climate change, that number speaks
       volumes.
       That's why tomorrow, OFA supporters are coordinating a nationwide
       day of action to tell members of Congressâin personâthat it's time
       to get serious about climate change.
       In climate deniers' districts, we'll be calling them out and
       shining a big old light on their denial of climate science. And in
       other areas, we'll be thanking elected officials for being part of
       the solutionâand asking them to continue to lead.
       [46]Will you join us on Tuesday?
       The scientific community has reached [47]a level of consensus that
       you don't often see regarding the reality of climate change and its
       consequences. NASA and the national academy of sciences of every
       major country in the world have all said that climate change is
       realâand manmade.
       That's not reflected in our leadership in Washington. And it starts
       at the top in the House of Representatives. Speaker John Boehner,
       House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and nearly every member of House
       Republican leadership continue to insist there's no problem.
       This congressional failure of leadership demands a response. It's
       time to get the backs of everyone in Washington who's willing to be
       a champion on this issue. That's what Tuesday is all about.
       RSVP for a climate change [48]day of action event in your
       neighborhood.
