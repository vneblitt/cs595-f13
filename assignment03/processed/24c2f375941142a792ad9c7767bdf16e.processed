     * [42]March on Washington, 1963

       It was August 1963 in Hartford, Connecticut. I was 24 years old. I
       was a mom. I was white. I had heard about the March‚everyone
       had‚and I knew I had to go. I wanted to be part of the movement, I
       wanted to help make a statement.
       The morning of August 28th came: I arrived in Washington, DC, with
       a few friends. There was a sense of history in the air. The police
       were tense and rigid, yet the crowd remained joyous. Color didn't
       matter; blacks and whites came together, hugging‚there was no
       difference between us.
       Music set the mood‚Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, The Mamas and The
       Papas‚these artists and their songs were the poetry of our time. We
       were never going to stop. We had no fear.
       You could feel the thunder on the ground. I can still feel the
       ground under my feet moving, conjuring up the memory of what ended
       up being one of the largest political rallies for human rights in
       United States history.
       Times were changing. Hundreds of thousands of people had gathered
       in this one place to stand up for jobs and freedom‚seeing it come
       together and knowing activists made it happen was a very powerful
       feeing. The voices of each and every American could make a
       difference.
       The March helped me see just how much there was to stand up for. In
       the five decades since, I have been devoted to activism. To this
       day, I continue to volunteer for [45]Organizing for Action to
       ensure the voices of the American people are being represented.
       Saturday, nearly fifty years later, I attended an event to
       commemorate the anniversary of the March. Reverend Al Sharpton
       renewed our mission to go back and continue working. He brought it
       all together: We need to keep fighting, we need to keep [46]the
       dream alive.
