   Jane Lynch
   'I Kinda Like Being Single'
   Exclusive
   [41]091313_jane_lynch_launch
   It's clear marriage wasn't right for Jane Lynch -- at least not now --
   'cause the "Glee" star tells TMZ she's really diggin' the single life
   at the moment.
   The always friendly Lynch was out in Bev Hills the other day when we
   asked her if she's ready to meet some new ladies, now that a couple of
   months have passed since she and wife Lara Embry split up.
   But Lynch says she's not sure she wants to jump back into a
   relationship -- telling us, "I kinda like being single."
   Makes sense, considering Lynch's divorce recently turned nasty -- with
   Embry trying to nail Jane to the wall with more than $93k per month in
   spousal support.
   With those kinda problems, single life kinda makes sense ... right?

   It's amazing the amount of greed there is from even these short-lived
   relationships. Get with someone rich for a couple of years and expect
   to be set up for life with spousal support. Sickening.

   I love Jane Lynch and always watch your videos of her. I like how she
   warned the camera guy not to run into people. (common decency, camera
   guy)

   I'm interested now in how Jane and Embry met.

   If Embry came on to Jane as "Her Biggest Fan."

   What kind of doctor Embry is, what she practices, when she practices,
   and patient referrals, etc.

   Jane always takes the high road, to Jane's credit.

   But Embry having a clear grasp of Jane's assets from moment-one, then
   publishing such?

   Embry's understanding of Jane's growing wealth?

   Down to a decimal point?

   Made my nose start itching.

   Since she's asked Jane to support her in the "Lifestyle she's become
   accustomed."

   To what lifestyle WAS Embry accustomed?

   Before Jane?

   Did Embry even HAVE ... an actual practice?

   I've met a lot of wacky Los Angeles people.

   Insisting on the title of "Doctor."

   Border-line neck adjustment people.

   "Psychologists with online degrees."

   Professional students -

   All with business cards saying doctor.

   Doctor this, doctor that, doctor the other thing.

   ...borderline/alleged medical degrees, etc.

   ...Embry sounds as if she bought nothing into this relationship -

   Except maybe a title, good looks, decent bod, etc.

   And one of those ever-pleasing and supportive personalities...

   -As she now goes for Jane's throat.

   What if we're FOOLED, tricked into not deploying a pre-nup?

   I've been fooled by two of the slickest women God ever placed on this
   Green Earth.

   Would have SWORN these two had character.

   -Played me to the 17th.

   Destroying my ability to trust my OWN perception from that point
   forward.

   If you determine after-the-fact someone's pushed all of the right
   buttons so you DON'T do a pre-nup?

   Do you have any legal recourse.

   Not that Embry is - who knows ...

   But Sociopaths are beyond our understanding of treacherous -

   Easily able to use our own compassion/empathy - against us.

   They see compassion as weakness - exploit potential -

   Like Spyware that glances over your registry values/start-up menu.

   For opportunity.

   Better get to Church.

   I'm The Sociopath -Whisperer.

   That's how I arguably know so much about Sociopaths.

   Only from my own world and experience, not Jane's, not anyone else's.

   As a four/five year old I recognized both parents were misfits of a
   professional nature.

   Dangerous, unfeeling, violent.

   Mixed with a twisted need to dupe Society.

   I had a choice.

   Be destroyed by them as my four siblings were.

   Or use the opportunity to study them - like lab rats.

   For 32 years, or right during grad school

   When I dropped the hammer on them.

   Outed them publicly.

   For crimes vs children, including molestation, criminal acts of child
   abuse.

   Which included being slashed at age two.

   Sociopaths/psychopaths haven't the capacity to feel.

   We're like a fence post in their view.

   Something to urinate on.

   As children we were props.

   Used for food stamps, welfare, housing, medical care, sympathy.

   Good to see with the advent of gay marriage that they ALSO get to
   experience the joys of divorce and all the bills that go with it.
   And as in Jane's case, once again the man get's hit with the bill...
   LOL !!
   But hey, as usual, any price is worth being rid of the bitch....
