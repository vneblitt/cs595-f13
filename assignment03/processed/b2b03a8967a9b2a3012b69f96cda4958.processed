   ISSUE: FALL 2013

   leaders and trailblazers who encourage us to pursue our dreams, explore
   the unknown, and stand up for those without a voice.

       One Asian women of influence that I would love to see you do an
       article about is two time Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan. She
       has had the most influence on me than anyone I have been inspired
       by. Her achievements are too numerous to mention. Michelle Kwan is
       an Asian American women who has influenced many all over the world.

       Alex Wagner is a media Schill and nothing but a talking head. She
       is not influencial in the least and very rude during her
       interviews. Putting her on this list shows bad taste.
