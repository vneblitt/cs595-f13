   BLACKSBURG, Va., March 29, 2013 - Recognizing the continuing growth of
   the [160]Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets and its need to house more than
   1,000 cadets, the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors initiated on Monday
   planning efforts to address the buildings on the Upper Quad while
   honoring the historic nature of that precinct.

   University planners envision replacing [161]Brodie and [162]Rasche
   halls with state-of-the-art residence halls to house more than 1,000
   cadets. A new Corps Leadership and Military Science building will house
   the Corps of Cadets administrative staff, the Rice Center for Leader
   Development, Military Science (ROTC) staff, and other program needs
   such as corps and ROTC training rooms.

   [163]Lane Hall will be placed on the National Registry of Historic
   Sites and steps will be taken to preserve it for decades to come.


   an Aerial Photo of the upper quad The current configuration of the
   Upper Quad showing Brodie Hall (lower left), Rasche Hall (lower right),
   and Lane Hall (center).

   At the completion of the phased construction, [164]Thomas and
   [165]Monteith halls will be razed with no current plans for
   replacement.

   "The corps represents one of our oldest programs and traditions, but
   has long ago outgrown its current facilities. It needs modern buildings
   to reflect its modern role in university life, while maintaining the
   heritage of the Upper Quad," said Sherwood Wilson, vice president for
   administration.

   Brodie and Rasche halls, the main dormitories for the corps were built
   in 1894 and 1900 respectively, and the "new" sections were added in
   1957.

   "Unfortunately, the structure and infrastructure of these old buildings
   are so dated as to make infeasible simply refurbishing them," said
   Jason Soileau, assistant vice president for university planning. "Some
   rooms are too small, others too large, and the total square footage
   available is inadequate to provide sufficient bed spaces for today's
   larger corps. We envision two new residence halls of about 95,000
   square feet, each holding at least 500 cadets."

   Cadets are currently spread among four halls in the Upper Quad.

   "It is interesting to look back over a 20 year time span and see in
   1992 the Corps of Cadets totaled just 404 cadets as compared to Fall
   2012, where we reached 1,066 participating cadets. This new number of
   cadets represents our largest corps since 1968," said General Randal
   Fullhart, commandant.

   "The university's Corps of Cadets is vital and strong with continuing
   demand for admission. Needs are quite different for today's cadets.
   Like all 21st century students, they create electrical and
   communications infrastructure demands that far exceed designs from over
   a half century ago. In addition, they also are issued far more
   equipment than in years past. Cadets and the corps in general have much
   larger storage requirements in rooms today," said Fullhart.

   The Office of University Planning commissioned an architectural design
   competition to develop concepts for repurposing the campus Upper Quad.
   Four national design firms: AECOM, Cannon, Clark-Nexsen, and Sasaki
   were selected to present their conceptual designs to the campus
   community.
     * [166]See each firm's concepts on the Facilities Services website.

   "We are very pleased with the results of the design competition and the
   creative efforts brought forth by each firm. Once selected, the design
   firm will work closely with us as we further the Upper Quad precinct
   design. This will allow all stakeholders and the board of visitors to
   make a very informed decision on the future of the Upper Quad," said
   Soileau.

   The proposed 63,000-square-foot Corps Leadership in Military Science
   building will consolidate operations now scattered among five buildings
   in the Upper Quad precinct. Faculty and administrative offices for the
   Military Sciences Department and the Corps of Cadets will be located
   here along with modern classrooms.

   University planners see consolidation of the corps and military science
   operations within these three new buildings and Lane Hall as win-win
   for the campus and the occupants bringing more efficient and effective
   operations throughout.

   [167]Femoyer Hall, currently home for some of these operations, could
   be repurposed.

   "I am very excited about the possibilities created by addressing the
   needs of the Upper Quad," said Wilson. " Not only can we create
   desperately needed and appropriate spaces and facilities for the corps
   and military sciences program, we have a chance to establish the
   university's iconic collegiate gothic design in an area built on
   century old traditions."

   Lane Hall, with its archetypal military-post architecture common to
   many land-grant universities, will be preserved and repurposed.

   Recently, Doug Domenech, Virginia's Secretary of Natural Resources,
   toured the Upper Quad with Kathleen Kilpatirck, director of Virginia's
   Department of Historic Resources, and university leaders to discuss the
   need for the proposed renovations and to appreciate the steps being
   taken for Lane Hall's preservation.

   "Lane Hall is of unquestionable importance, reflecting the university's
   earliest  history  and the corps' proud  traditions. So too are the
   program needs of the modern corps critically important and the case for
   new facilities is compelling," said Kilpatrick.  "Saving Lane and
   recognizing it on the Virginia State Landmarks Register and the
   National Register of Historic Places strikes a good balance and
   demonstrates Virginia Tech's commitment to honoring its history and
   buildings of enduring value while moving forward," she said.

   Ironically, designs uncovered from the early 1900s demonstrate
   proposals to expand the Upper Quad facilities by enveloping them in
   collegiate gothic trim. Although not feasible at the time, these
   concepts, drawn either by J. Ambler Johnston or Ralph Adams Cram,
   served as the inspiration for the first McBryde Hall, which established
   the architectural vernacular now intrinsic to the Virginia Tech campus.


   Architectual rendering of campus circa 1903 In the early 20th century,
   Virginia Agricultural & Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute
   President John McBryde commissioned designs for converting the red
   brick core campus, then centered on the upper quad, to the then
   emerging collegiate gothic style of architecture. Though never built,
   these concepts inspired Virginia Tech's campus architecture prevalent
   today.

   Cram, a highly respected Boston architect and known as the nation's
   "high priest" of Gothic Revival architecture, mentored the young
   Johnston, VPI Class of 1903. Johnston later became a prolific architect
   and partner in the Richmond firm, Carneal and Johnston, which designed
   many buildings at Virginia Tech throughout the early and mid-20th
   century.

   "I find it fitting that two of our earliest traditions, the Corps of
   Cadets and our unique collegiate gothic architecture, can come together
   in this special way," said Wilson.

   The board of visitors approved $5.8 million in planning efforts for the
   residence halls, currently estimated to cost about $90 million total.
   No estimate was given for the Corps Leadership and Military Science
   building.

   In addition to the Upper Quad, Domenech also toured other areas of
   campus including Solitude. After his tour Domenech wrote to Wilson,
   "Just a note to thank you for hosting me on campus for the tour of
   planned activities on the historic military quad, and at Solitude.
   Both places demonstrate Virginia Tech's commitment to history and
   tradition.  I am proud to be a Tech grad and that, in this job, I have
   been able to interact with the university on a number of issues."

   Dedicated to its motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), [168]Virginia
   Tech takes a hands-on, engaging approach to education, preparing
   scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the
   commonwealth's most comprehensive university and its leading research
   institution, Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree
   programs to more than 30,000 students and manages a research portfolio
   of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of
   transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and
   by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and
   across Virginia.

About the corps

       The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets has been producing military and
   corporate leaders since the university was founded in 1872.

   The [177]Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets has been producing military and
   corporate leaders since the university was founded in 1872. It is one
   of just two remaining military corps within a large, primarily civilian
   university.

   The corps' commitment to the D-Day Memorial earned cadets a
   [178]commendation from the Virginia House of Delegates in 2007.
