Participate!

   According to the UN, there are more than a billion persons with
   disabilities in the world.

   They face physical, social, economic and cultural barriers that hinder
   their access to education, employment, health services, justice system
   and, more broadly, society. Now is the time to help break barriers and
   open doors. Here are some ideas on how you can participate:
     * In the lead up to the UN High-level Meeting on Disability and
       Development on 23 September, you are encouraged to share ideas on
       how to enable everyone, everywhere. Join the global conversation on
       [24]Facebook and [25]Twitter (using #thisability) and and submit
       your ideas, like Rebecca has in the video below.
