U.S., Russia reach agreement on seizure of Syrian chemical weapons arsenal

   [296][TS-Par7657788.jpg]

   Video: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister
   Sergei Lavrov reached agreement Saturday on a framework for Syria to
   destroy all of its chemical weapons.

By Anne Gearan and [297]Scott Wilson, E-mail the writers

   GENEVA -- The United States and Russia agreed Saturday on a plan to
   bring Syrian chemical weapons under international control, a rare
   diplomatic victory in a brutal civil war that appears to head off a
   punitive U.S. military strike on Syria in the near future.

   In announcing the deal, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and his
   Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said the agreement would be backed
   by a U.N. Security Council resolution that could allow for sanctions or
   other consequences if Syria fails to comply.

   military force.

   [308]Security Council passes accord on Syria's chemical weapons

   Colum Lynch and Anne Gearan

   Damascus ordered to destroy its chemical arsenal, but resolution does
   not specify consequences if it fails.

   Kerry said the first international inspection of Syria's chemical
   weapons stockpile is set for November, with destruction to begin next
   year. But Lavrov added a more cautious note to what was an otherwise
   jubilant moment in Geneva, where the talks took place.

   Lavrov stressed that the documents released Saturday, outlining the
   transfer of Syria's large chemical weapons arsenal and its destruction,
   constitute only an "agreed proposal" that does not yet have the force
   of law. The plan drew sharp anger from Syria's U.S.-backed rebels and
   received decidedly mixed reviews from the U.S. Congress, across party
   lines.

   "Providing this effort is fully implemented, it can end the threat
   these weapons pose not only to the Syrian people, but also to their
   neighbors, to the region," Kerry said.

   The agreement, if successfully implemented, marks a modest victory for
   the Obama administration in its mostly arms-length engagement with
   Syria's 2Ω-year-old conflict.

   It was [309]President Obama's threat of U.S. military strikes after
   Syria's Aug. 21 alleged use of chemical weapons -- killing an estimated
   1,400 people, hundreds of them children -- that began the process
   culminating Saturday in an agreement for Syria to give up its chemical
   stockpile.

   Over the years, that arsenal has provided Syria with a strategic
   benefit against Israel, with whom it is formally at war, and most
   recently with Syrian rebel forces seeking to topple President Bashar
   al-Assad's government.

   More than 100,000 people have died in the Syrian uprising since Obama
   in 2011 called for Assad to step down, arguing that he had lost the
   moral legitimacy to lead the country.

   While removing the threat of chemical weapons from the battlefield
   benefits Syria's rebels and reduces the chance of a regional war over
   their use, the deal does not change the basic trajectory of the civil
   war, in which Assad and his Russian-supplied weapons clearly hold the
   upper hand against a less cohesive rebel force.

   News of the agreement drew immediate criticism from prominent
   Republicans in Congress, [310]some of whom had supported the idea of
   airstrikes against Assad after last month's use of chemical weapons,
   putting them briefly on the same side as Obama.

   "What concerns us most is that our friends and enemies will take the
   same lessons from this agreement -- they see it as an act of
   provocative weakness on America's part," Republican Sens. John McCain
   (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) said in a statement Saturday. "We
   cannot imagine a worse signal to send to Iran as it continues its push
   for a nuclear weapon."
