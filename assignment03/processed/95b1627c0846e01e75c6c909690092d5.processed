   David Tutera, Former Partner
   Split Babies
   in Half
   Exclusive Details
   0913_david_ryan_01
   David Tutera -- the host of "My Fair Wedding" -- followed the biblical
   path in his split with Ryan Jurica  -- he gets one of their twins, and
   Ryan gets one.
   The two men had a 10-year domestic partnership that blew apart in
   January ... and it got UGLY.  And there was a big complication -- they
   had fraternal twins through a surrogate in July, and that triggered a
   bitter custody battle.
   Now here's the complication.  Each man fertilized an egg that was then
   implanted in the same surrogate, who gave birth to the two babies at
   the same time.  It appears the eggs are from the same biological
   mother.
   Sources familiar with the situation tell TMZ ... a judge has issued a
   temporary custody arrangement in which David gets custody of his
   biological child, baby girl Cielo, and Ryan gets custody of his
   biological child, Cedric.

   We're told David and Ryan are "close" to a final settlement, where the
   temporary custody arrangement will become permanent.
   We're also told the two men are getting along.  It's unclear if they
   will each get visitation rights of each other's kid. So we gotta ask
   ...
   FYI, Tutera had a chance to explain himself on "The View" this morning.
   Check the clip.

   So a judge actually split the babies up and gave one to each man? They
   are humans not a sandwich!!! I hear a lot of stories about gay people
   wanting the right to get married to their partner, they get married and
   then less than a year later they are splitting up, what gives?

   It's scientifically proven that babies that share the same womb share a
   special conmection. It's a travesty that they are separated and will
   not get to grow up together in the same home as siblings should. Shame
   on the judge that co-signed on this epically bad agreement......

   the only ones that seem to benefit from these divorces are the
   lawyers.... omg poor, poor babies... losing a family home and now their
   twin sibling... in a hetero divorce would twins be split up? i hope
   this temporary arrangement does not become permanent...
   and as for the so-called "fathers", you'd think their children would be
   first but no, revenge seems to be the order of the day.... grow the eff
   up for your kids' sakes...

   These babies are merely a couple months old, so they will be fine.
   There are situations where siblings who've grown up in the same
   household for a time are split up during a divorce (kids have told
   judges they want to go with either their mom or dad). That's much
   harder than it would be on an infant.
   What would be nice is if both men eventually get over the bullcrap that
   split them up, become friends and let the kids get to know one another
   as they grow up.

   Yea... THIS IS A GREAT IDEA! "Because we're gay... SELFISH... parents
   that are divorcing AND... should have NEVER been legally married in the
   first place... impregnating a woman with both of our wormy spermies...
   NOW that our relationship has failed... LET'S DIVIDE UP THE TWINS!??"
   It's NOT like they have a say so anyways... right? I say... "A lawyer
   needs to step in AND... fight for their little rights!!" This is
   simply... DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Give these precious children
   a life AND... place them into a NORMAL... loving family... that will
   NOT ever witness a walk in on daddy... daddy relationships!! UGH...
