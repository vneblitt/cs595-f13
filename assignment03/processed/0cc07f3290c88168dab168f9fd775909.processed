[31]Welcome to Post-Constitution America: What If Your Country Begins to
Change and No One Notices?

   By [32]Peter Van Buren

   Crossposted from [33]TomDispatch
   On July 30, 1778, the Continental Congress created the first
   [34]whistleblower protection law, stating "that it is the duty of all
   persons in the service of the United States to give the earliest
   information to Congress or other proper authority of any misconduct,
   frauds, or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons in the
   service of these states."

   Two hundred thirty-five years later, on July 30, 2013, Bradley Manning
   was found [35]guilty on 20 of the 22 charges for which he was
   prosecuted, specifically for "espionage" and for videos of [36]war
   atrocities he released, but not for "aiding the enemy."

   Days after the verdict, with sentencing hearings in which Manning could
   receive 136 years of prison time ongoing, the pundits have had their
   say. The problem is that they missed the most chilling aspect of the
   Manning case: the way it ushered us, almost unnoticed, into
   post-Constitutional America.

   The Weapons of War Come Home

   Even before the Manning trial began, the emerging look of that new
   America was coming into view.  In recent years, weapons, tactics, and
   techniques developed in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as in the war on
   terror have begun arriving in "the homeland."

   Consider, for instance, the rise of the [37]warrior cop, of
   increasingly up-armored police departments across the country often
   filled with former military personnel encouraged to use the sort of
   rough tactics they once wielded in combat zones. Supporting them are
   the kinds of weaponry that once would have been inconceivable in police
   departments, including armored vehicles, typically bought with
   Department of Homeland Security [38]grants. Recently, the director of
   the FBI informed a Senate committee that the Bureau was [39]deploying
   its first drones over the United States.  Meanwhile, Customs and Border
   Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security and already
   flying an expanding fleet of Predator drones, the very ones used in
   America's war zones, is eager to [40]arm them with "non-lethal"
   weaponry to "immobilize targets of interest."

   Above all, surveillance technology has been coming home from our
   distant war zones. The National Security Agency (NSA), for instance,
   pioneered the use of cell phones to track potential enemy movements in
   Iraq and Afghanistan. The NSA did this in one of several ways. With the
   aim of remotely turning on cell phones as audio monitoring or GPS
   devices, rogue signals could be sent out through an existing network,
   or NSA software could be implanted on phones disguised as downloads of
   porn or games.

   Using fake cell phone towers that actually intercept phone signals en
   route to real towers, the U.S. could harvest hardware information in
   Iraq and Afghanistan that would forever label a phone and allow the NSA
   to always uniquely identify it, even if the [41]SIM card was changed.
   The fake cell towers also allowed the NSA to gather precise location
   data for the phone, vacuum up metadata, and monitor what was being
   said.

   At one point, more than 100 NSA teams had been scouring [42]Iraq for
   snippets of electronic data that might be useful to military planners.
   The agency's director, General Keith Alexander, changed that: he
   devised a strategy called [43]Real Time Regional Gateway to grab every
   Iraqi text, phone call, email, and social media interaction. "Rather
   than look for a single needle in the haystack, his approach was, `Let's
   collect the whole haystack,'âEURS" [44]said one former senior U.S.
   intelligence official. "Collect it all, tag it, store it, and whatever
   it is you want, you go searching for it."

   Sound familiar, Mr. Snowden?

   Welcome Home, Soldier (Part I)

   Thanks to [45]Edward Snowden, we now know that the "collect it all"
   technique employed by the NSA in Iraq would soon enough be used to
   collect American metadata and other electronically available
   information, including credit card transactions, air ticket purchases,
   and financial records. At the vast new $2 billion [46]data center it is
   building in Bluffdale, Utah, and at other locations, the NSA is
   following its Iraq script of saving everything, so that once an
   American became a target, his or her whole history can be combed
   through. Such searches do not require [47]approval by a court, or even
   an NSA supervisor. As it happened, however, the job was easier to
   accomplish in the U.S. than in Iraq, as [48]internet companies and
   [49]telephone service providers are required by secret law to hand over
   the required data, neatly formatted, with no messy spying required.

   When the U.S. wanted something in Iraq or Afghanistan, they sent guys
   to kick down doors and take it. This, too, may be beginning to happen
   here at home. Recently, despite other valuable and easily portable
   objects lying nearby, [50]computers, and only computers, were stolen
   from the law offices representing State Department whistleblower
   Aurelia Fedenisn. Similarly, a Washington law firm representing NSA
   whistleblower [51]Tom Drake had [52]computers, and only computers,
   stolen from its office.

   In these years, the FBI has brought two other NSA wartime tools home.
   The Bureau now uses a device called [53]Stingray to recreate those
   battlefield fake cell phone towers and track people in the U.S. without
   their knowledge. Stingray offers some unique advantages: it bypasses
   the phone company entirely, which is, of course, handy in a war zone in
   which a phone company may be controlled by less than cooperative types,
   or if phone companies no longer cooperate with the government, or
   simply if you don't want the phone company or anyone else to know
   you're snooping. American phone companies seem to have been quite
   cooperative. [54]Verizon, for instance, admits hacking its own cellular
   modems ("[55]air cards") to facilitate FBI intrusion.

   The FBI is also following NSA's lead [56]implanting spyware and other
   hacker software developed for our war zones secretly and remotely in
   American computers and cell phones. The Bureau can then remotely turn
   on phone and laptop microphones, even webcams, to monitor citizens,
   while files can be pulled from a computer or implanted onto a computer.

   Among the latest examples of war technology making the trip back to the
   homeland is the [57]aerostat, a tethered medium-sized blimp. Anyone who
   served in Iraq or Afghanistan will [58]recognize the thing, as one or
   more of them flew over nearly every military base of any size or
   importance. The Army recently announced plans to operate two such
   blimps [59]over Washington, D.C., starting in 2014. Allegedly they are
   only to serve as anti-missile defenses, though in our war zones they
   were used as massive surveillance platforms. As a taste of the sorts of
   surveillance systems the aerostats were equipped with abroad but the
   Army says they won't have here at home, consider [60]Gorgon Stare, a
   system that can transmit live images of an [61]entire town.  And unlike
   drones, an aerostat never needs to land. Ever.

   Welcome Home, Soldier (Part II)

   And so to Bradley Manning.

   As the weaponry and technology of war came home, so did a new,
   increasingly Guantanamo-ized definition of justice. This is one thing
   the Manning case has made clear.

   As a start, Manning was treated no differently than America's
   war-on-terror prisoners at Guantanamo and the [62]black sites that the
   Bush administration set up around the world. Picked up on the
   "battlefield," Manning was first [63]kept incommunicado in a cage in
   Kuwait for two months with no access to a lawyer. Then, despite being
   an active duty member of the Army, he was handed over to the Marines,
   who also guard Guantanamo, to be held in a military prison in Quantico,
   Virginia.

   What followed were [64]three years of cruel detainment, where, as might
   well have happened at Gitmo, Manning, kept in isolation, was deprived
   of clothing, communications, legal advice, and sleep. The [65]sleep
   deprivation regime imposed on him certainly met any standard, other
   than Washington's and possibly Pyongyang's, for torture. In return for
   such abuse, even after a judge had formally ruled that he was subjected
   to excessively harsh treatment, Manning will only get a [66]112-day
   reduction in his eventual sentence.

   Eventually the Obama administration decided Manning was to be tried as
   a soldier before a military court. In the courtroom, itself inside a
   [67]military facility that also houses NSA headquarters, there was a
   strikingly gulag-like atmosphere.  His trial was built around secret
   witnesses and secret evidence; severe restrictions were put on the
   press -- the Army [68]denied press passes to 270 of the 350 media
   organizations that applied; and there was a clear [69]appearance of
   injustice. Among other things, the [70]judge ruled against nearly every
   defense motion.

   During the months of the trial, the U.S. military refused to release
   official transcripts of the proceedings. Even a private courtroom
   sketch artist was [71]barred from the room. Independent journalist and
   activist [72]Alexa O'Brien then took it upon herself to attend the
   trial daily, defy the Army, and make an [73]unofficial [74]record of
   the proceedings by hand. Later in the trial, armed military police were
   stationed [75]behind reporters listening to testimony. Above all, the
   feeling that Manning's fate was predetermined could hardly be avoided.
   After all, President Obama, the former Constitutional law professor,
   essentially proclaimed him [76]guilty back in 2011 and the Department
   of Defense didn't hesitate to [77]state more generally that "leaking is
   tantamount to aiding the enemies of the United States."

   As at Guantanamo, rules of evidence reaching back to early English
   common law were turned upside down. In Manning's case, he was convicted
   of espionage, even though the prosecution did not have to prove either
   his intent to help another government or that harm was caused; a
   civilian court had already [78]paved the way for such a ruling in
   another whistleblower case. In addition, the government was allowed to
   label Manning a [79]"traitor" and an "anarchist" in open court, though
   he was on trial for neither [80]treason nor [81]anarchy. His Army
   [82]supervisor in the U.S. and Iraq was allowed to [83]testify against
   him despite having made biased and homophobic statements about him in a
   [84]movie built around portraying Manning as a sad, sexually-confused,
   attention-seeking young man mesmerized by WikiLeaks founder Julian
   Assange. Finally, the same judge who essentially harassed the press
   throughout Manning's trial [85]issued a 24-hour advance notice of her
   verdict to ensure maximum coverage only of the denouement, not the
   process.

   Given all this, it is small comfort to know that Manning, nailed on the
   Espionage Act after [86]multiple failures in other cases by the Obama
   administration, was not convicted of the extreme charge of "aiding the
   enemy."

   Not Manning Alone

   Someday, Manning's case may be seen as a bitter landmark on the road to
   a post-Constitutional America, but it won't be seen as the first case
   in the development of the post-Constitutional system. Immediately
   following 9/11, top officials in the Bush administration decided to
   "[87]take the gloves off." Soon after, a wounded [88]John Walker Lindh,
   the so-called [89]American Taliban, was captured on an Afghan
   battlefield, held in a windowless shipping container, refused access to
   a lawyer even after he demanded one as an American citizen, and
   interrogated against his will by the FBI. Access to medical care was
   used as a bribe to solicit information from him. "Evidence" obtained by
   such means was then used to convict him in court.

   [90]Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who clumsily plotted to detonate a
   [91]nonexistent "dirty bomb," was held incommunicado for more three
   years, over a year of which was in a South Carolina military jail. He
   was arrested only as a [92]material witness and was not formally
   charged with a crime until years later. He was given no means to
   challenge his detention under habeas corpus, as President Bush
   designated him an "[93]enemy combatant." [94]Pictures of Padilla being
   moved wearing sound-proof and light-proof gear strongly suggest he was
   subjected to the same psychosis-inducing sensory deprivation used as
   "[95]white torture" against America's [96]foreign enemies in
   Guantanamo.

   Certainly, the most egregious case of pre-Manning post-Constitutional
   justice was the execution of American citizen [97]Anwar al-Awlaki by
   drone in Yemen, without due process or trial, for being an al-Qaeda
   propagandist. In this, President Obama and his top counterterrorism
   advisors quite literally took on the role of judge, jury, and
   executioner.  In a similar fashion, again in Yemen, the U.S. [98]killed
   al-Awlaki's American teenage son, a boy no one claimed was connected to
   terrorism. Obama administration lawyers went on to claim the [99]legal
   right to execute U.S. citizens without trial or due process and have
   admitted to killing [100]four Americans. Attorney General Eric Holder
   [101]declared that "United States citizenship alone does not make such
   individuals immune from being targeted."

   Then-FBI Director [102]Robert Mueller, asked in a Congressional hearing
   if the FBI could assassinate an American citizen in the United States,
   replied that he simply [103]did not know. "I have to go back. Uh, I'm
   not certain whether that was addressed or not." He added, "I'm going to
   defer that to others in the Department of Justice." As if competing for
   an Orwellian prize, an unnamed Obama administration official [104]told
   the Washington Post, "What constitutes due process in this case is a
   due process in war."

   Post-Constitutional America

   So welcome to post-Constitutional America. Its shape is, ominously
   enough, beginning to come into view.

   Orwell's famed dystopian novel 1984 was not intended as an instruction
   manual, but just days before the Manning verdict, the Obama
   administration essentially [105]buried its now-ironic-campaign
   [106]promise to protect whistleblowers, sending it down Washington's
   version of the [107]memory hole. Post-9/11, torture famously stopped
   being torture if an American did it, and its users were [108]not
   prosecutable by the Justice Department.

   Similarly, full-spectrum spying is not considered to violate the Fourth
   Amendment and does not even require [109]probable cause. [110]Low-level
   NSA analysts have desktop access to the private emails and phone calls
   of Americans. The Post Office photographs the envelopes of every one of
   the 160 billion pieces of mail it handles, collecting the [111]metadata
   of "to:" and "from:" addresses. An Obama administration [112]Insider
   Threat Program requires federal employees (including the [113]Peace
   Corps) to report on the suspicious behavior of coworkers.

   Government officials concerned over possible wrongdoing in their
   departments or agencies who "go through proper channels" are [114]fired
   or [115]prosecuted. Government whistleblowers are commanded to return
   to face [116]justice, while law-breakers in the service of the
   government are allowed to flee [117]justice. CIA officers who destroy
   evidence of [118]torture go free, while a CIA agent who blew the
   whistle on [119]torture is locked up.

   [120]Secret laws and secret [121]courts can create [122]secret law you
   can't know about for "crimes" you don't even know exist.  You can
   nonetheless be arrested for committing them. Thanks to the PATRIOT Act,
   citizens, even [123]librarians, can be served by the FBI with a
   [124]National Security Letter (not requiring a court order) demanding
   records and other information, and gagging them from revealing to
   anyone that such information has been demanded or such a letter
   delivered.  Citizens may be held without trial, and denied their
   Constitutional rights as soon as they are designated "[125]terrorists."
   Lawyers and habeas corpus are available only when the government
   allows.

   In the last decade, [126]10 times as many employers turned to FBI
   criminal databases to screen job applicants. The press is restricted
   when it comes to covering "open trials." The [127]war on whistleblowers
   is metastasizing into a [128]war on the First Amendment. People may now
   be convicted based on secret testimony by unnamed persons. Military
   courts and jails can replace civilian ones. Justice can be twisted and
   tangled into an almost unrecognizable form and then used to send a
   young man to prison for decades. Claiming its actions lawful while
   shielding the [129]"legal" opinions cited, often even from Congress,
   the government can send its drones to assassinate its own citizens.

   One by one, the tools and attitudes of the war on terror, of a world in
   which the "gloves" are eternally off, have come home. The comic strip
   character Pogo's classic [130]warning -- "We have met the enemy and he
   is us" -- seems ever less like a metaphor. According to the government,
   increasingly we are now indeed their enemy.

   Peter Van Buren blew the whistle on State Department waste and
   mismanagement during Iraq Reconstruction in his first book, [131]We
   Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of
   the Iraqi People. A TomDispatch regular, he writes about current events
   at his blog, [132]We Meant Well. Van Buren's next book, [133]Ghosts of
   Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent, will be available March 2014.

       [202]What Bradley Manning's Sentence Will Tell Us About Our
