Snapshots from NYPL by Denise Canniff, Director of Engagement August 12, 2013

   We all have great memories about our local library--old and new--the
   favorite book series we checked out when we were young, pictures we
   drew during a class, or how we used the quiet space for study and
   research. We thought, wouldn't it be great to offer our patrons a
   unique way to capture a moment from their library visit? Will they tell
   us how they use the library? Could we make it easy for them to share
   the moment with others?

   We ultimately decided to install photo booths at two of our libraries.
   Photo booths, after all, have a rich history in American culture. There
   are [127]books written about their legacy and artists have used them
   for experimentation and expression for decades. In the 1960s, [128]Andy
   Warhol was seemingly obsessed with the use of photo booths, producing
   portraits of himself and famous faces of the era.

   Even with the widespread use of photo-enabled smartphones and
   social-networking sites like Instagram, photo booths remain popular
   today. In the few weeks since installing the booths, we've gotten more
   than 1,900 photographs that represent a fascinating portrait of our
   patrons, from light-hearted to serious-minded individuals, couples, and
   families.

   One booth is located at the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building in Astor
   Hall and the other is at Mid-Manhattan Library, on the ground floor
   near the entrance. The locations were chosen based on their close
   proximity to each other and to the office of the Multimedia team
   responsible for the installation and ongoing maintenance of the
   equipment. (Huge thanks to Richert Schnorr and other members of
   Multimedia who spent countless hours on this project!)

   We decided to offer patrons preselected options for what brings them to
   the Library--borrowing, exploring, learning, reading, researching,
   studying, visiting, writing--and where they are from--Bronx, Brooklyn,
   Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, outside the New York region. By
   providing these options, it is quick and easy to participate and it
   should allow us to easily aggregate the data the way we would with
   traditional survey methodology. The photographs are sent to the email
   address provided to us and we hope our patrons will share the image,
   their library moment, with friends and family.

   Visit Mid-Manhattan Library or the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, take
   your picture, and share with others how you use the Library. Share with
   us, too, on [129]Instagram by using #NYPL and #NYPLPhotobooth
   hashtags. We will continue to highlight ones here on the Inside NYPL
   blog channel, and on [130]Facebook and [131]Twitter.

   For a brief history of the photo booth and its inventor, Siberian
   immigrant Anatol Josepho (March 31, 1894 - December 1980), read
   this [132]blog post written by Billy Parrott, Managing Librarian at
   Mid-Manhattan Library, Art and Picture Collections.

[136]Photo Booth Pics

   Submitted by Rudy on August 14, 2013 at 11:14 AM.

   This very much reminds me of JR's recent project in Times Square where
   he set up a photo booth and took pics of passers-by.

   Regardless, I feel that the white background in the above pics is a bit
   harsh. I would use something of a darker color. It would add a bit of
   richness to the photo and also help absorb the harsh lighting.

   Otherwise, I think that this is a great idea to get patrons involved
   and make the library more of a personal experience.

[138]Thanks for your comment

   Thanks for your comment Rudy,

   As the photo booth project continues to evolve and grow, feedback from
   patrons like you will help us make it a continued success. So, I really
   do appreciate you taking the time to write a comment.
   I hope you'll be able to stop by and take a photo soon if you haven't
   already.

   Best,

[140]A Couple of Ideas to Make a Great Idea Greater

   Submitted by Anonymous on August 16, 2013 at 11:35 AM.

   Love this idea, but I think in addition to flickr, the NYPL Photobooth
   should have its own Instagram feed. I tagged my photo on IG, but only
   spotted a couple of other booth pics on IG. Also what would be great if
   there were some props - like copies of most loved books, library cards,
   etc. for people to use in their pics. It's the library and it's an
   awesome place - think it should be more incorporated/represented in the
   pictures!

   Thanks for your comment! We are continuing to experiment with how to
   get our users to share their photos in many ways, including Instagram.
   We will definitely take your suggestions into account as we continue to
   refine the booths and make them even better.

   Thanks for your question,

   Currently you cannot search the Flickr feed by name. That's a feature
   that we're looking at adding in our next round of software updates,
   possibly next month. Many of the improvements we're looking into
   involves how to more easily use the data, such as the date the photo
   was taken, and name and location of the user. Currently, the Flickr
   stream displays the images by most recent photographs.

[148]Photobooth set-up

   Submitted by Anonymous on August 23, 2013 at 10:41 AM.

   What a great idea! No doubt other libraries and museums may be
   interested in creating a similar opportunity. Did you use actual photo
   booth equipment or design your own system to take the snapshots and
   post them?

   We worked with MVS Studio ([151]http://www.markvans.com) on the
   production of the booths. They were great to work with and their
   experience in the field was invaluable.

   This project is forward-thinking and a lot of fun. I'm very curious
   about the staff requirements to keep it running, the equipment, etc.
   Would you consider sharing that information with museums and galleries
   as well as with other libraries? It would make a fascinating
   presentation at a conference, or maybe a google hangout for other
   people in the industry. Thanks for sharing.
