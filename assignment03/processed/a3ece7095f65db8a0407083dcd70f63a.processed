Webhooks Are Here!

   Posted on [7]August 5, 2013 by [8]Stuart Larson

   Weâre happy to announce the launch of webhooks in our [9]developer API!
   Webhooks provide a way for apps to be notified when there is a change
   to a user's board, card, list, or any other model. This is perfect for
   developers working on third party apps that need data to be in sync.

Why We Need âem

   There are a number of third party apps that either use Trello as their
   backend or have Trello integrated as part of a larger product. With our
   current API set up, third party apps need to constantly poll for
   updates in order to stay in sync, even if there isn't anything new. For
   some third party apps, thatâs a Trello request every few seconds per
   user they manage.

   webhooks-old

   As you can imagine, this is super demanding on both Trello and the
   third-party appâs servers. With webhooks, we monitor specific models
   like cards and boards and only send an update to the user when somebody
   performs an action, like moving a card or adding a comment. There's no
   needless polling and our servers can sleep a little more peacefully.

Get Started

   If you want to play around with webhooks, weâve got a basic how-to in
   our API documentation which you can read [10]here. Itâs not exactly
   âplug and playâ, but we hope you find it useful once you set it up.
   Happy developing!

   Got questions about webhooks? Let us know on the [11]webhooks card on
   our Trello Development Board or ask away on [12]Twitter.
