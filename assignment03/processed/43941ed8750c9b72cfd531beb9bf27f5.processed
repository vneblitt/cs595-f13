Veterinary college maintains blood bank for animals

   BLACKSBURG, Va., Aug. 21, 2013 - Giving the gift of life through blood
   donations is not only confined to humans. At the Virginia-Maryland
   Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, dogs and cats regularly donate
   blood to the college's blood bank.

   A critical supply of blood must be maintained year round at the
   [160]Veterinary Teaching Hospital where both emergency and routine
   surgeries are daily occurrences. Dogs and cats have different blood
   types just like humans, so it is necessary to keep a supply of all
   canine and feline blood types on hand.

   Dr. David Grant, associate professor of internal medicine in the
   Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, and veterinary technician
   Melanie Gevedon are in charge of maintaining the hospital blood bank.

   "We currently have 23 canine and feline blood donors," noted Gevedon.
   "The majority of these donors are owned by students and staff at the
   veterinary hospital and college." Donors are solicited through
   announcements made in classes and flyers posted throughout the college.

   Just like with human blood donations, a minimum weight exists for
   animal donors. An age range is also enforced. Dogs must be between one
   and eight years old and weigh a minimum of 50 pounds. Temperament is
   also important since the dog must lie quietly on its side while blood
   is drawn.

   Feline donors must be between one and eight years old, weigh a minimum
   of 11 pounds, be an indoor-only cat, and the owner must agree to have
   the cat sedated for blood draws. Both dog and cat donors must pass
   several tests and screenings including health testing, vaccinations,
   and be in good body condition.

   Owners typically bring in their dogs three to five times a year for an
   early morning appointment. Because the need for feline blood is not in
   as high demand as canine, the hospital does not store a large number of
   units. Instead, cat donors are on call. It's not unusual for a cat
   owner to get a phone call in the middle of the night because the
   hospital is in need of their cat's blood. Blood transfusions for cats
   are also more complicated than those for dogs because cats must receive
   their specific blood type.

   "The donors aren't coming in when it's convenient for them," said
   Grant. "They're coming in when we need them."

   The donors and their caretakers do receive some compensation for their
   sacrifice of blood and time.  Annual health care exams, vaccinations,
   heartworm prevention, flea prevention, worm prevention, and blood tests
   are covered by the hospital.

   Amanda Weakley of Madison, Va., a fourth-year veterinary student,
   faithfully brings in her seven-year-old calico cat, Cali, to donate
   blood at the veterinary hospital.

   "As a veterinary student, I have seen first-hand the need for blood
   transfusions, and the fact that Cali can supply a unit of blood for
   another animal is heartwarming," said Weakley.

   Cassie Wedd, a recent Doctor of Veterinary Medicine graduate from
   Richmond, Va., brings her seven-year-old greyhound, Reesee "Pieces"
   Wedd, to donate blood. However, Reesee isn't the only one who has
   regular appointments to donate.

   "I also try to schedule a blood donation for myself on the same day
   that Reesee donates.  It's a good thing for both of us to do and it
   keeps us on a schedule," said Wedd. "It's nice when dogs can give back
   to the community too."

A sacrifice to save lives

   When humans want to donate blood, they generally make an appointment at
   a blood center or take a trip to the local bloodmobile. Risks are very
   minor, and donors can donate blood, then go about their day in as
   little as 30 minutes.

   The same can't be said for animal donors. In addition to having to set
   up specific appointments or be called-in to donate, cats have to be
   anesthetized since they will not hold still for the draw. Just like
   with human anesthesia, there is always a possibility that the animal
   may not wake up. This has never happened at the veterinary hospital,
   but owners are fully aware of the risk.

   "It does not deter the animals and their owners from sacrificing to
   save the lives of others," noted Gevedon, who has been working with the
   blood bank for 14 years.

   Dogs must lie on their side for their blood draw and are not
   anesthetized. A small portion of the dog's neck is shaved, and the
   blood is drawn from the jugular vein. Each draw from a dog results in
   450 milliliters of whole blood, which is then separated into one unit
   of packed red blood cells and two plasma units. Each draw from a dog
   can help as many as three other dogs.

   Cat donors are anesthetized, and their blood is also drawn from the
   jugular vein. Each draw from a cat results in 53 milliliters of whole
   blood, and those packs are occasionally separated into red blood cell
   and plasma units, but it's not as common as with dogs' blood.

   The need for canine or feline blood is not as high as the constant need
   for human blood. However, thanks to the faithful donors at the
   veterinary hospital, along with some supplementary purchased blood, the
   annual need for animal blood at the veterinary college is met.

   Despite the financial compensation of free annual health care, Grant
   and Gevedon note that this perk doesn't come close to the sacrifice
   that is made by the animals and their owners.

   "The owners are willing to bring their animals here, and the animals
   are willing (to donate)," said Gevedon. "They're real heroes and we
   just want to say how much we appreciate their sacrifice in helping us."
   The [161]Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine is a
   leading biomedical teaching and research center, enrolling more than
   500 Doctor of Veterinary Medicine students, master of public health,
   and biomedical and veterinary sciences graduate students. The college
   is a partnership between the land-grant universities of Virginia Tech
   and the University of Maryland. Its main campus in Blacksburg, Va.,
   features the Veterinary Teaching Hospital and large animal field
   services which together treat more than 79,000 animals annually. Other
   locations include the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center in
   Leesburg, Va., and the Gudelsky Veterinary Center in College Park, Md.
