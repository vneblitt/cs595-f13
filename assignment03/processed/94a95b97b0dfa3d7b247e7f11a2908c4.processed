   ROANOKE, Va., Sept. 16, 2013 - Researchers at the [160]Virginia Tech
   Carilion Research Institute have reported the first experimental
   evidence that supports the theory that a soccer ball-shaped
   nanoparticle, commonly called a buckyball, is the result of a breakdown
   of larger structures rather than being built atom-by-atom from the
   ground up.

   Technically known as fullerenes, these spherical carbon molecules have
   shown great promise for uses in medicine, solar energy, and
   optoelectronics. One small hiccup, however, has hindered development of
   a deeper understanding of these peculiar structures over the past few
   decades: No one knows exactly how they are formed.

   Although several processes for making fullerenes are well documented,
   there are two competing theories about the mechanisms at work at the
   molecular level. The first and oldest is the "bottom-up" theory, which
   says these carbon cages are built atom-by-atom, like the slow
   construction of a Lego model. The second, more recent theory takes a
   "top-down" approach, suggesting instead that fullerenes are formed when
   much larger structures break into constituent parts.

   After several years of debate with little more than computational
   models in support of how the top-down theory might work, researchers
   led by [161]Harry Dorn, a professor at the Virginia Tech Carilion
   Research Institute, report the discovery of the missing link:
   asymmetrical fullerenes that are formed from larger structures that
   appear to be in the process of settling into stable fullerenes.

   The discovery appeared online Sept. 15 in the journal Nature Chemistry.

   "Understanding the molecular mechanics of how fullerenes and their many
   variations are formed is not just a curiosity," said Dorn, who has been
   researching metallofullerenes - fullerenes with a few atoms of metal
   held within - for more than two decades. "It would give us insights
   into new, better ways to prepare them. Fullerenes and metallofullerenes
   are already involved in hundreds of biomedical studies. The ability to
   create large numbers of a wide variety of metallofullerenes would be a
   giant building block that would take the field to new heights."

   The medicinal promise of metallofullerenes stems from the atoms of
   metal that are caged within. Because the metal atoms are trapped in a
   cage of carbon, they do not react with the outside world, making their
   side-effect risks low in both number and intensity.

   For example, one particular metallofullerene with gadolinium at its
   core has been shown to be up to 40 times better as a contrast agent in
   magnetic resonance imaging scans for diagnostic imaging than options
   now commercially available. Current experiments are also directed at
   using metallofullerenes carrying therapeutic radioactive ions to target
   cancer tissue.

   "A better understanding of the formation of fullerenes and
   metallofullerenes may allow the development of new contrast agents for
   magnetic resonance imaging at commercial-level quantities," said
   Jianyuan Zhang of Beijing, a graduate student in Dorn's laboratory and
   the first author of the paper. "These larger quantities will facilitate
   a next generation of contrast agents with multiple targets."

   Dorn's new study hinges on the isolation and purification of
   approximately 100 micrograms - roughly the size of several specks of
   pepper - of a particular metallofullerene consisting of 84 carbon atoms
   with two additional carbon atoms and two yttrium atoms trapped inside.
   When Dorn and his colleagues determined the metallofullerene's exact
   structure using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and single crystal
   X-ray analysis, they made a startling discovery. The asymmetrical
   molecule could theoretically collapse to form nearly every known
   fullerene and metallofullerene. All the processes would require would
   be a few minor perturbations - the breaking of only a few molecular
   bonds - and the cage would become highly symmetrical and stable.

   This insight, Dorn said, supports the theory that fullerenes are formed
   from graphene - a single sheet of carbon just one atom thick - when key
   molecular bonds begin to break down. And although the study focuses on
   fullerenes with yttrium trapped inside, it also shows that the carbon
   distribution looks similar for empty cages, suggesting the formation
   process of regular fullerenes is the same.

   "Not only are the findings presented in Dr. Dorn's paper extremely
   interesting, but the study represents a real milestone in the field,"
   said Takeshi Akasaka, a professor of chemistry at the University of
   Tsukuba in Japan and an internationally renowned scientist in
   metallofullerenes, who was not involved in the research. "The study
   presents physical evidence for a process of metallofullerene creation
   that most scientists in the field initially scoffed at."

   "Ever since it was discovered that fullerenes were formed from
   asteroids colliding with Earth and fullerenes were found in
   interstellar space, scientists have questioned the bottom-up theory of
   their formation," said Dorn. "With this study, we hope to be that much
   closer to understanding their formation and creating entirely new
   classes of fullerenes and metallofullerenes that could be useful in
   medicine as well as in other fields that haven't even occurred to us
   yet."

   "Dr. Dorn's insight into the fundamental process whereby fullerenes are
   formed is a major contribution to the field," said [162]Michael
   Friedlander, executive director of the Virginia Tech Carilion Research
   Institute. "Understanding the molecular steps in their formation is key
   to realizing fully the potential of this versatile and potentially
   potent family of chemicals in medicine. Dr. Dorn's contributions to
   understanding these molecules are paving the way for the formulation of
   targeted novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and the combination of both
   -- theranostics. This approach will provide an important component for
   tomorrow's arsenal of precision medicine."

   The study is titled "A missing link in the transformation from
   asymmetric to symmetric metallofullerene cages suggesting a top-down
   fullerene formation mechanism." Joining Dorn and Zhang on the paper are
   Faye Bowles, a graduate student researcher at the University of
   California, Davis; Daniel Bearden, a research scientist in the Hollings
   Marine Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology; W. Keith Ray, a senior research associate in biochemistry
   at Virginia Tech; Tim Fuhrer, now an assistant professor of chemistry
   at Radford University; Youqing Ye of Shanghai, a graduate student in
   chemistry at Virginia Tech; Caitlyn Dixon of Raleigh, N.C., an
   undergraduate student in chemistry at Virginia Tech; Kim Harich, an
   analytical biochemist at Virginia Tech; Richard Helm, an associate
   professor of biochemistry at Virginia Tech; Marilyn Olmstead, a
   professor of chemistry at the University of California, Davis; and Alan
   Balch, a distinguished professor of chemistry at the University of
   California, Davis.

   Institute joins the basic science, life science, bioinformatics, and
   engineering strengths of Virginia Tech with the medical practice and
   medical education experience of Carilion Clinic. Virginia Tech Carilion
   is located in a new biomedical health sciences campus in Roanoke at 2
   Riverside Circle.
