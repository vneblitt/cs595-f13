     * [42]Speaking truth to power about Obamacare

       During the August congressional recess, lawmakers are in their home
       districts to speak to constituents face-to-face. Many are holding
       town halls, where people can make their voices heard on the issues
       that matter to them. And there's one law in particular
       representatives are hearing a lot about, especially if they've
       voted to repeal it on 40 separate occasions: Obamacare.
       At several town halls all over the country, constituents who have
       seen for themselves that the law is working have been fact-checking
       their elected representatives' claims and calling them out over
       their votes to take Obamacare away.
       North Carolina [45]Congressman Patrick McHenry and Florida
       [46]Congressman Daniel Webster both got called out in front of
       dozens of people at town halls in their districts. Representatives
       McHenry and Webster both voted to repeal Obamacare, and they have
       vocal constituents who don't agree with their stance on the law.
       In Nevada, a small businessman [47]took a stand against Congressman
       Joe Heck's efforts to repeal Obamacare. Ron Nelsen asked his
       representative why he is trying to take away the positive
       contributions Obamacare will make to his family's and his
       employees' health care.

       Finally, in Pennsylvania, Representative Dent was [49]confronted by
       constituents who challenged his misleading claims about rising
       health care costs.
       This is a big deal. One by one, lawmakers are seeing that their
       votes for repeal aren't just about political posturingâthey're
       about taking benefits away from the people in their communities who
       are benefitting from the law.
       Now is the time to make your voice heard, and show your
       representatives where you stand. Momentum is building as more and
       more Americans stand up for Obamacare, and call out representatives
       who are trying to take affordable health care away from millions.
