   Wage and Hour Division (WHD)

   Overtime Pay

   Overview

   The federal overtime provisions are contained in the Fair Labor
   Standards Act (FLSA). Unless exempt, employees covered by the Act must
   receive overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek at a rate
   not less than time and one-half their regular rates of pay. There is no
   limit in the Act on the number of hours employees aged 16 and older may
   work in any workweek. The Act does not require overtime pay for work on
   Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or regular days of rest, unless overtime
   is worked on such days.

   The Act applies on a workweek basis. An employee's workweek is a fixed
   and regularly recurring period of 168 hours -- seven consecutive
   24-hour periods. It need not coincide with the calendar week, but may
   begin on any day and at any hour of the day. Different workweeks may be
   established for different employees or groups of employees. Averaging
   of hours over two or more weeks is not permitted. Normally, overtime
   pay earned in a particular workweek must be paid on the regular pay day
   for the pay period in which the wages were earned.
