Engineering students gather on Saturdays for Deep Dives

   On a cold Saturday morning in February 2013, a dozen or so [83]College
   of Engineering students assembled in a second floor lab at the Virginia
   Tech [84]Corporate Research Center. A snowstorm was forecast, but they
   hunkered down for a chance to brainstorm and put the university's
   "Hands-On, Minds-On" approach to education to work in a single-day
   event known as [85]Deep Dive.

   "They are just a fun time to work on something with your hands just for
   the sake of learning something new," said Chris Guida of Leesburg, Va.,
   a master's student in [86]industrial and systems engineering.


   Mohammed Shafae of and Devita McCullough assemble the frame of a
   touchscreen computer display table at a Deep Dive event. Mohammed
   Shafae of Alexandria, Egypt, and Devita McCullough of Colonial Heights,
   Va., assemble the frame of a touchscreen computer display table at a
   Deep Dive event. Both are doctoral students in industrial and systems
   engineering.

   Deep Dive is an informal session for students to work as a team to
   crack a specific engineering problem crafted by Jaime Camelio,
   associate professor of industrial and systems engineering  and director
   of Virginia Tech's [87]Center for Innovation-based Manufacturing.
   Student participants also propose issues.

   "Traditionally, we solve long-term, specific-research problems, but we
   do not have many opportunities to solve smaller problems," Camelio
   said. "We wanted to solve simple problems quick."

   Camelio and former graduate student Marek Zareba started Deep Dive in
   2009. They based the concept on a California consulting firm that took
   on the task of redesigning the shopping cart in a single week. When
   Camelio heard of the story, the idea clicked as an education effort.

   The events are akin to overnight "lock-ins" that churches have with
   youth groups -- but without the game or movie marathons. Rather,
   students "lock" themselves inside a lab and take on the day's problem,
   not letting themselves out until the task is solved.


   Wenmeng Tian and Anna Schuh assemble the support legs of the display
   table. Wenmeng Tian of Tianjin, China, and Anna Schuh of St. Paul Park,
   Minn., assemble the support legs of the display table. Both are
   doctoral students in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems
   Engineering.

   Students, of course, are free to come and go as they please, but most
   do remain for the day. The sessions are open to all students, not just
   those in engineering.

   At past Deep Dives, students created a vision recognition tool that
   compares the number of holes in a stamped metal part with its original
   CAD model and developed a new way to visualize quality-control data of
   a product -- in that day's case, a car -- in a 3-D viewing environment.

   On the snowy February day, about 20 students gathered to build a
   touch-screen computer display table. Unlike previous Deep Dives, set
   instructions already were known, but nothing went as planned. A mirror
   arrived cracked, but a backup had been preordered. A projector for the
   table proved an ill fit. Plans had to be improvised and tested.

   "There is always something that will go wrong," said Greg Purdy of
   Beaverton, Ore., a doctoral student in industrial and systems
   engineering who served as team leader. When students needed to gut a
   floppy disk for a part, and none was readily available, a participant
   joked, "Let's time travel back to 1994."

   Hiccups have purpose. "The biggest gain for the students is that they
   discover that they have the ability to learn and implement new
   knowledge faster than they thought," Camelio said.


   Lee Wells, Cory Niziolek, and Arvinth Chandar Rathinam perform final
   user tests on the touch-screen computer display table. Lee Wells of
   Allegan, Mich., Cory Niziolek of Newark, Del., and Arvinth Chandar
   Rathinam of Chennai, India, perform final user tests on the
   touch-screen computer display table. Wells is a doctoral student in
   industrial and systems engineering. Niziolek and Rathinam are master's
   students in the program.

   "The events allow us to come together to solve a specific, interesting
   problem that's generally outside of our `daily grind' of classes,
   research, and other lab activities," said Anna Schuh of St. Paul Park,
   Minn., an industrial and systems engineering doctoral student. "The
   touch-surface computer is not just a new piece of equipment, it's a new
   piece of equipment we all helped build together."

   Building the table took longer than expected. "This is really the core
   of why I attend the Deep Dives," Purdy said. "It is not just the final
   product or revelation, which is amazing, it is seeing the power of
   collaboration at work."

   Deep Dives are normally held twice per semester on Saturdays. Sessions
   begin at 8 a.m. Locations vary according to the topic.

   Events are open to all Virginia Tech students, not just engineering
   majors. For more information, contact Associate Professor [91]Jaime
   Camelio at 540-231-8976.

Who is Jaime Camelio?

       Jaime Camelio

   [92]Jaime Camelio is an associate professor and assistant department
   head of the [93]Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering.

   He also is the director for the [94]Institute for Critical Technology
   and Applied Science's [95]Center for Innovation-based Manufacturing and
   the manufacturing systems director for the [96]Commonwealth Center for
   Advanced Manufacturing.

   His research focuses on assembly systems, uncertainty management,
   systems diagnosis/prognosis, active monitoring, and remanufacturing.

About the Center for Innovation-based Manufacturing

   The multi-disciplinary [97]center focuses on solving current
   manufacturing issues and assists Virginia Tech in commercializing new
   technologies discovered or created at the university. Its
   innovation-based manufacturing goal is to boost the commercialization
   potential of basic research that is constrained by a lack of adequate
   processes and systems.
