   There are a number of books in yesterday's New York Times Review which
   you don't have yet. This has been going on for the last few years.
   Just a few years ago all of the titles in the Times would have been on
   order or in the branches by Monday. What's happened?

[133]The NYPL automated sorters impact on staffing levels

   Submitted on May 19, 2010 at 8:57 AM.

   No NYPL jobs were lost as a result of automating sorter operation. To
   achieve the sorters amazing speed and efficiency a full complement of
   sorting staff is required. We have the same number of full-time
   permanent staff now as we did before we installed the automated sorter.
   Through the
   automated sorters' speed and efficiency, the library was able to
   eliminate the use of non-library temporary hourly workers that were
   used during heavy sorting volume days. The automated sorter also allows
   us to eliminate many hours of costly, unwanted overtime that was
   exhausting the staff. This has created much-needed economic savings
   during difficult financial times and boosted staff morale.

   No NYPL jobs were lost. But jobs were lost. In your own words "the
   library was able to eliminate the use of non-library temporary hourly
   workers".

   Great machine, well done, congratulations. But lets not try to hide the
   costs.

[137]Hooray for efficiency, but...

   Submitted on May 15, 2010 at 6:02 PM.

   What happened to the two-thirds of the sorting staff that were made
   redundant?

   I've long complained about the sloooooow nature of NYPL's book
   transfers. It was the one complaint I've ever had about the entire
   system, which I love and support. And I've noticed the recent new speed
   of transfers and truly appreciate it.

   But I would rather wait weeks and know some folks are employed than get
   my book tomorrow. In this economy, if these workers were laid off, it
   would be a tragedy.

   put the books?? We see them sliding into bins. Explain! Show the path
   of one book, for instance. Cut out the non-music and give us some
   information. This could have been very amusing and instructive.

   This is so fabulous.
   I have been a lover of the NYPL since 1945 when my mother
   taught me to read. I spent so many days over the years at
   branches from Yorkville to Jefferson to 58th Street to the
   Lost Donnell and, naturally, the Big One as I used to say
   as a child.
   But never in all these years have I seen such a terrific
   new machine that will bring such wonderful experiences
   to all New Yorkers.
   Bravo/Brava to the NYPL.

   Thank goodness (and the government) for the NY Public Library! After I
   lost my job, the library became a life saver. I used to buy a lot of
   books and also get them for free through my job. There has barely been
   a bump in my reading life since I started using the library. In fact,
   I'm reading more! I am so grateful -- for myself, and for all the
   people who depend on the library for access to life sustaining
   resources.

   Glad to hear the library is trying to cut time between reserve requests
   and delivery to the patron, especially since reducing requests nimbers
   to ten and slowing delivery. The reserve system is the best part of the
   libray for me.

   The video would have been interesting if we were told the step-by-step
   process of a book getting from one branch to another using the new
   system. Showing books whiz by on a conveyor without explaining the
   process made the video underwhelming.
