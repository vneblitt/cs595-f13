   John Lewis is the only person to have spoken at the 1963 March on
   Washington who is still alive. He was just 23 years old when he
   addressed the crowd of more than 200,000 at the Lincoln Memorial 50
   years ago.

   Lewis is a pillar of the civil rights movement. The son of
   sharecroppers in rural Alabama, he went on to become the president of
   the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and then
   eventually, a U.S. Congressman from Georgia.

   His story has been told before in documentaries and books, but now he's
   putting his life story into the form of a graphic novel, March. Every
   superhero has an origin story â and so does the graphic novel of John
   Lewis' life.

   A bunch of staffers on the Lewis' 2008 re-election campaign were
   sitting around, talking about what they would do next, including
   staffer Andrew Aydin.

   "Unashamed, I said I would be going to a comic book convention. And
   there was a little teasing, but Congressman Lewis stood up for me,"
   recalls Aydin.

   "And I just said, 'You shouldn't laugh. At another time in another
   period there was a comic book called the Montgomery story â Martin
   Luther King Jr. and the Montgomery story â that inspired me â"

   Imagine a young John Lewis in 1958 â 18-years old â having arrived at
   college, picking up a comic book. Lewis says the comic tuned him in to
   the greater story:

   The comic book tells the story of Rosa Parks' symbolic refusal â but it
   also gives a detailed account of how to protest non-violently. It was a
   lesson Lewis took to heart when he staged sit-ins at segregated lunch
   counters in Nashville in the late '50s.

   "It was on February the 13th and we had the very first sit in here. I
   took my seat at the counter, I asked the waitress for a hamburger and a
   coke," Lewis says in a 1960 NBC documentary.

   Lewis' staffer, Andrew Aydin, knew the history but didn't know about
   the old comic book. Aydin became convinced Lewis should tell his story
   as a graphic novel. But Lewis wasn't so sure.

   "I thought he was somewhat out of his mind? Why would I be writing a
   comic book?" Lewis says.

   But then he thought back: "I do remember reading the Montgomery story
   comic book, and I said, 'Yes, if you would do it with me.' And it's
   been a labor of love."

   That labor brought them all the way to San Diego's Comic Con â the geek
   and supernatural mecca known for its outlandish costumes and.

   Waiting in line were three Dr. Whos, four Wolverines, and that one guy
   in an elaborate Transformers outfit. But they weren't waiting to see
   the stars from the latest sci-fi movie. Hundreds of people stood in
   line to have Congressman Lewis sign their copies of March.

   Among the Comic Con fans was Mary Clark, a teacher at San Elijo Middle
   School in San Marcos, Calif.

   "This will go into my library collection â as a graphic novel,
   sometimes students who aren't really enthusiastic readers will pick it
   up thinking its about the pictures â so to be able to give them a story
   along side those pictures... and something as powerful as Congressman
   Lewis' story..." says Clark.

   That story Âspanning the Congressman's seven decades, will be told in
   three books. March is the first.

   It begins with John Lewis as an old man waking on a dark early morning
   in Washington, D.C. ÂIt's 2009, the day of President Barack Obama's
   inauguration. Quickly the reader is sent back in time â to Lewis'
   childhood, when he was taking care of his sharecropper parents'
   chickens â [55]practicing sermons on the young birds. The pictures are
   black and white, and graphic artist Nate Powell renders Lewis' life in
   shadow. Powell says he drew the story close to the ground, the way a
   child would experience the world.

   I could slip into his shoes for that second and I knew precisely what
   it was like to witness the baptism of these chickens â the loss of a
   beloved hen down a well. Hiding under the porch so that he could sneak
   away from his house in order to get an education each day and hop on
   the bus with his mom chasing after him.

   The up-close perspective â sometimes so close you only see what Lewis
   is seeing â gives way to wide shots and birds' eye views as the story
   shifts to sit-ins and marches. Powell says there were things that were
   tough to draw.

   "Trying to find the appropriate and powerful way to respectfully depict
   the murder of Emmett Till," Powell said, for instance.

[64]'March' Sheds New Light On A Civil Rights Hero

   Till was a 14-year-old boy brutally killed in Mississippi for allegedly
   whistling at a white woman. His murder received national attention and
   helped galvanize the civil rights movement. In the graphic novel, we
   see an image of Till's mangled body. Drawn from above, after Till has
   been dragged from the river, Powell makes thin jagged lines of ink to
   create a sense of human flesh that's turned into broken twigs.

   Lewis says, just like the Martin Luther King comic book that inspired
   him, March is also a primer on non-violence. The Congressman says this
   is a lesson he and his co-authors, Aydin and Powell, want to keep
   alive.

   "I remember hearing Martin Luther King Jr. preach from time to time,"
   says Lewis. "And his father would be in the pulpit. And he would say,
   'Sonâmake it plainâmake it plain.'Â So between Nate and Andrew, they
   made it plain."
