   WASHINGTON ([40]The Borowitz Report)--Attempting to quell criticism of
   his proposal for a limited military mission in Syria, President Obama
   floated a more modest strategy today, saying that any U.S. action in
   Syria would have "no objective whatsoever."

   "Let me be clear," he said in an interview on CNN. "Our goal will not
   be to effect régime change, or alter the balance of power in Syria, or
   bring the civil war there to an end. We will simply do something random
   there for one or two days and then leave."

   "I want to reassure our allies and the people of Syria that what we are
   about to undertake, if we undertake it at all, will have no purpose or
   goal," he said. "This is consistent with U.S. foreign policy of the
   past."

   While Mr. Obama clearly hoped that his proposal of a brief and
   pointless intervention in Syria would reassure the international
   community, it immediately drew howls of protest from U.S. allies, who
   argued that two days was too open-ended a timeframe for such a mission.

   That criticism led White House spokesman Jay Carney to brief reporters
   later in the day, arguing that the President was willing to scale down
   the U.S. mission to "twenty-four hours, thirty-six tops."

   "It may take twenty-four hours, but it could also take twelve," Mr.
   Carney said.

   "Maybe we get in there, take a look around, and get out right away. But
   however long it takes, one thing will not change: this mission will
   have no point. The President is resolute about that."
