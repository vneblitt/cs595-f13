There's a map for that: MarineTraffic.com (again!)

   [3]MarineTraffic.com is a favorite of The Rachel Maddow Show (see
   [4]here and [5]here) and this may be the coolest use of it I've seen
   yet.

   First a bit of back story: The Koch Brothers own a giant pile of
   high-sulfur, high-carbon petroleum waste called petroleum coke, sitting
   on the bank of the Detroit River. By "giant pile" I mean three stories
   high and a block long. There is a refinery across the river that
   processes tar sands from Canada. The coke is a waste byproduct of that
   refining process.

   Naturally, [6]the locals are not too keen on it.

   But one man's waste is another man's low-cost, high pollution power
   plant fuel, so that's where the Koch Brothers have a business angle.
   That raises the next question of concern to environmentalists (and
   people with lungs and... earthlings): if the Koch brothers are selling
   piles of their black mountain to be burned, who's doing the burning?

   Enter our hero, MarineTraffic.com. The International Maritime
   Organization requires all ships over a certain size to carry something
   called an AIS transponder. The AIS transponder transmits basic data
   like position, speed, course, and the ship's name. MarineTraffic.com
   maps that data.

   So when observers see a ship called the Atlantic Huron being loaded up
   with the Koch's coke, they enter the name and track it. One of the
   options in the vessel's search result is "Show Vessel's Track" and
   clicking that gives you a green line that shows roughly a day's worth
   of travel. When I looked yesterday, the green like started at the mouth
   of the St. Lawrence River and when down to Quebec City. Right now it
   looks like it's docked in Montreal.

   I don't know if the Atlantic Huron is still doing petcoke deliveries,
   but when it was spotted at the Kochs' black heap, observers were able
   to follow where it went next, all the way to Nova Scotia where they
   figured out there are two plants licensed to burn coke fuel.

   [7]Mystery solved.

   Boy oh boy are the Canadian Maritimes losing their environmental cred -
   as if they ever had any with the mass murder of the seal pups every
   year.

   Canada's whole scam as "the civilized sector of North America" is
   unraveling, what with the Coke Mayor of Toronto, this stuff, the
   Alberta travesty, the deforestation of British Columbia...

   This high sulfur tar sands byproduct is being exported to developing
   nations to burn in power plants that don't even have the basic
   technology in stack scrubbers.

   Petcoke is created when any kind of petroleum is refined, not just
   bitumen from tar sands.

   There are other uses besides burning, such as in batteries and
   electrodes.

   Some has high sulfur, regardless of its source. If foreign countries
   burn it without a sulfur dioxide scrubber, shame on them.

   This was reported on in the Detroit newspapers early in May but not
   much has been said since. The property upon which the pet-Koch mountain
   grows is owned by Matthew (Mattie) Maroun, the same guy who owns the
   Detroit-Windsor Ambassador Bridge and is fighting tooth and nail to
   stop construction of the new Detroit International Bridge crossing.
   Maroun is a real piece of work right up there w/the Koch brothers, but
   not as wealthy.

   No, he's not as wealthy, but he tried real hard to prevent the new
   bridge with that state constitution amendment that was on the ballot in
   2012. We call him Moron up here in Yooperland.

   NO. The limeballs are now putting their profits and your savings
   (leveraged you know) into building PRIVATE CITIES that will house the
   executives, enforcement managers, and like minded deprivers and
   thieves, as they are now doing in GUATAMALA.

   Once the OWNERS CLUB is able to secure the pimped out political
   criminals to do their bidding, voting will simply be a contest of "WHO
   WILL KILL YOU THE LEAST" throo desparation via deprivation.

   Well now either they are going to build a self sufficient city under a
   bio dome or they will die off with everyone else.

   If they build a bio dome they better have great security and the guards
   are not about to live outside so they will need a very big dome.

   I think they actually plan to escape in some type of space craft. In
   fact we might be Martians ourselves that left Mars as the sun changed
   in size and the pollution we caused there killed off food
   sources.(imagination is cool sometimes)

   Like dumping nuclear waste into the ocean reduced the cost of nuclear
   power? Or like letting oil companies write their own regulations on
   deep oil drilling reduced the cost?

   One thing we can count on is they will call for less regulations and
   demand these shipments be protected from prying eyes as a matter of
   national security.

   I am personally as liberal as they come, but I worked in the pet coke
   business for years. Pet coke is higher in sulfur than most coal, and
   higher in other pollutants too, but also higher in BTUs when burned .
   When sold to US and Canadian companies, it is blended with coal in
   percentages that still allow their emissions to be legal.

   Pet coke sold for export, though, is subject only to the users' home
   regulations. Europe--probably OK. Other places--not so much.

   Burning pet coke releases sulfur dioxide. Period. The boilers licensed
   to do this are on the Atlantic coast and far from large populations,
   indicating that they probably got the licenses because the waste gases
   get blown over the ocean and not over Canada.

   This same stuff could be used to generate electricity and useful
   chemicals, such as methanol (used for plastics and other materials), at
   plants with essentially zero emissions (e.g. the Kingsport facility
   owned by Eastman Chemical). Because the pollution of the North Atlantic
   and the Arctic is allowed ('not our problem'), the burning of this
   stuff is more profitable than using it at a plant with zero emissions.

   The current major industrial source of methanol is synthesis from
   natural gas. Instead of turning clean-burning natural gas into methanol
   and burning pet coke, we could cleanly burn the natural gas and use the
   pet coke to make basic chemicals such as methanol and sulfuric acid.
   The way to do this is to tighten emission standards on power plants,
   even if the emissions are blown out of our and into someone else's
   territory.

   So acid rain that forms and acidifies the ocean killing off Coral where
   many fish breed or the fact that once picked up by upper air currents
   these gases get carried around the globe anyway, escapes their logic?

   We have known since the seventies that Virginia forests that were dying
   did so because of pollution from the west coast. We live in a closed
   system.

   This will continue unless enough people put the right kind of pressure
   on elected officials to end it. The constant mantra of 'cheap energy'
   and 'energy independent' has swayed people to the wrong side of this
   issue. The public needs to realize the trade-off of this kind of energy
   for the environmental damage that is happening and will continue to
   worsen will prove to be a bad deal for everyone and for the planet.

   Look what is happening in China and the quality of the air and water,
   not to mention what they are doing to their environment through the
   relentless exploitation of their natural resources. And, it's not only
   in China but they are going whole hog in places like Africa, Australia
   and soon in Canada with tar sands oil. What will be left for us is lots
   of petroleum coke, sludge, spills and other waste. Do people who want
   the Keystone XL really want this?

   Cheap energy has its cost, my friends....

   burning petcoke is "GREENER" than burning coal! I saw this on the news

   Maybe they should be called The Coke Brother's Pollution

   [86]http://www.citizenkoch.com/pages/about-the-film

   The media is all owned by JP Morgans General Electric. Until the public
   understands the magnitude of these people owning and misleading the
   entire inhabited earth nothing will be done. They own everything and
   control what they don't own and I'm not making this up.
