No Opera, No X-Rays!

   August 23, 2013 by [14]Jennifer Harbster

   The following is a guest post by Emmy-Award-winning engineer Mark
   Schubin who is a frequentÂ researcherÂ at the Library of Congress. He
   has been writing about the intersecting histories of opera and media
   technology since 1972 and currently serves as engineer-in-charge of the
   Metropolitan Operaâs Media Department. In October 2011, Mark gave a
   presentation at the Library on the âFandom of the Opera: How a
   400-year-old Art Form Helped Create Modern Media Technology.â You can
   view his lecture as a [15]webcastÂ or on ourÂ [16]YoutubeÂ [17]channel.
   You also might wish to check out a post he wrote for us last year-
   Â [18]Watching Baseball at the Opera House. Â

   Sitzungs-berichte Physikalisch-medicinische Gesellschaft zu Wurzburg,
   no. 1, 1896.

   This is about two once-deadly arts. One seems dangerous even today.
   When a dentist covers you with lead protection before taking an X-ray
   of your teeth, you know something requiring precautions is being done.
   Unfortunately, that knowledge was not available to early radiologists.

   Wilhelm Roentgen (RÃ¶ntgen) submitted to the secretary of the
   Physical-Medical Society at WÃ¼rzburg (Germany) his preliminary
   communication (VorlÃ¤ufige Mittheilung) about X-rays on December 28,
   1895*. Â Roentgen used the letter X to represent the unknown; others
   used âRoentgen raysâ to honor the discoverer. By the following spring
   Ernest Amory Codman, who was the first âskiagrapherâ (shadow printer)
   at Bostonâs Childrenâs Hospital, was already qualified as an âExpert in
   X-rayâ in a Boston court.

   The title of this post (No opera, no x-rays!) complete with exclamation
   point, first appeared in Merrill C. Sosmanâs âRoentgenology at Harvardâ
   (Harvard Medical Alumni Bulletin, v.21, 1947: 65-76). This article was
   about the history of roentgenology (radiology) according to notable
   figures in the field, many of whom were graduates of Harvardâs medical
   school. The phrase âNo opera, no x-rays!" was written by Percy Brown.
   Brown was the 11th president of the American Roentgen Ray Society and
   was the first head of the Roentgenology Department at Boston Childrenâs
   Hospital. He is more famous, however, as the author of the book
   [19]American Martyrs to Science through the Roentgen Rays (Springfield,
   Ill., Baltimore, Md., C.C. Thomas [c1936]). Brown himself had to have a
   number of fingers amputated and eventually died of X-ray induced
   carcinoma.

   The brilliant electrical engineer Nikola Tesla thought nothing of
   exposing himself to X-rays at the time. He was quoted in the article
   â[20]X Ray Wondersâ published in the St. Paul Daily Globe on March 11,
   1896, âThere is a general soothing effect, and I have felt a sensation
   of warmth in the upper part of the head.â

   As for opera, it, too, could be deadly. It wasn't boredom, the deaths
   of characters in plots, or the occasional accident, act of war, murder,
   suicide, or end of life by natural causes in an opera house; it was the
   lighting.

   The Opera House, the inauguration of the opera, Paris, France (between
   ca. 1890 and ca. 1900]). Photochrom print collection.

   Today opera houses are lit by electricity, but for most of operaâs
   history they were lit by some form of flame, whether gas in the 19th
   century or oil lamps and candles earlier. One danger, of course, was a
   conflagration. Artist Henri Matisse was at the OpÃ©ra-Comique in Paris
   the night of a deadly 1887 fire. According to Hilary Spurling in
   [21]The Unknown Matisse (New York : Alfred A. Knopf, 1998.), he âfought
   his way down to the ground floor, where he found thirty bodies piled up
   against a glass-paneled door that opened inwardsâ but was rescued by
   firefighters who broke in. Given the danger, large opera houses
   pioneered âfireproofâ construction and fire extinguishers and often had
   their own fire departments. But there were also less-obvious evils.

   We think of candlelight today as romantic, but thatâs from the sort of
   candles pioneered in the middle of the 19th century, as described in
   physicist Michael Faradayâs [22]The chemical history of a candle, a
   course of lectures delivered before a juvenile audience at the Royal
   Institution (edited by William Crookes, London, Chatto & Windus, 1874).
   Those modern candles, by the way, were perfected, in part, thanks to
   the paraffin-molding work of opera technical director Antonio Meucci.
   Older candles were smoky, stinky, and prone to bending over. In his
   book [23]Listening in Paris: a cultural history (Berkeley, University
   of California Press, c1995), James H. Johnson offers a contemporary
   18th-century account of an âintervening haze between the actors and the
   spectatorsâ and even found a complaint about candle smoke from Marie
   Antoinette. Early candles could also emit toxins, and their wicks
   weren't consumed, forcing singers to trim those on stage with special
   scissors called snuffers.

   Opera houses learned to make do. A 17th-century [24]handbook by Nicola
   Sabbattini (Pratica di fabricar scene e machine neâ teatri) has a
   diagram of a candle-based lighting dimmer. A contemporary account of a
   candle-lit chandelier rising into the ceiling at the beginning of an
   opera and thereby darkening a 17th-century auditorium may be found in
   A. M. Naglerâs [25]A Source Book in Theatrical History (New York :
   Dover Publications, 1959, c1952.). The darkening was a side benefit;
   bringing the chandelier up let technicians trim the candle wicks and
   kept hot-wax drips off patrons.

   As late as the end of the 19th century, flame-based lighting was still
   an opera house problem. [26]Ventilating and Heating by John Billings,
   published in 1893, includes a study of the Theatre Royal in Manchester,
   England. At a time when the outdoor temperature was 36 degrees
   Fahrenheit, it was 121 in the gallery seating. The outside air in the
   coal-burning industrial city had 530 parts-per-million of carbon
   dioxide; inside the level was 1,690, enough to affect respiration.

   Bacteria, mold, and other organic matter in the air were also many
   times higher indoors than out. And, while convection was roasting the
   upper opera-goers, it was freezing those below, sucking in cold air to
   replace the vented hot.

   Showing Harold Wellington Jones with C.B. Wormelle, Percy Brown, Arthur
   T. Legg, and Nathaniel Allison as interns at The Children's Hospital,
   Boston (1901). Image from the National Library of Medicine.

   So opera houses were among the first to adopt electric lighting,
   starting in 1881, before power companies (in 1849, the Paris Opera used
   an electric arc for a special effect and had to come up with a way to
   precipitate the toxic fumes from the acid-based batteries used). And
   the X-rays? Boston had one of the first opera houses with its own
   electric generators, something the city's Childrenâs Hospital lacked.
   Hereâs radiologist Brownâs full quote:

     The first X-ray department at the Children's was limited in its
     function by reason of the fact that the hospital was not equipped
     with electric current, and was obliged to obtain its power from the
     Opera House nearby. A wire was run from the Opera House to the
     Hospital, but when there was no music there was no current. No
     opera, no X-rays!Â "

   âSince we are on the topic of opera, the Library of Congress has opened
   a [27]new exhibit about this art form in the Performing Arts Gallery.
   My fellow blogger Cait Miller for In the Muse talked to the curators
   about the exhibit- see Â [28]NewÂ [29]Exhibit: Night at the Opera.

   * According to Harold S. Klicksteinâs [30]Wilhem Conrad RÃ¶ntgen On a
   New Kind of Rays:Â  A bibliographical study (1966), RÃ¶ntgenâs
   manuscript was submitted to the printer immediately for publication in
   the societyâs final report of 1895 as Ueber eine neue art von strahlen:
   Sitzungs-berichte der Physikalisch-medicinischen Gesellschaft zu
   WÃ¼rzburg, no. 9, 1895: 132-141. Â It was also published as an offprint
   (or reprint) before the societyâs publication as Eine Neue Art von
   Strahlen (WÃ¼rzubrg, Verlag und Druck der Stahelâschen K. Hof und
   UniversitÃ¤ts-Buch- Und Kunsthandlung, Ende 1895), which RÃ¶ntgen sent
   to well-known scientists. Â The first English translation of this work
   is the following: RÃ¶ntgen, W.C. [31]On a New Kind of Rays. Nature, v.
   53, January 23 1896: Â 274-276.

       Very interesting all the way through. Kept trying to "predict" how
       the title would completely tie the two together. Great closer!
       Surprised me.
