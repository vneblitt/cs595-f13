Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Landmark Events of the Civil Rights
Movement

   The Schomburg Center kicks-off its 2013-2014 season with a celebration
   of the 50th Anniversary of some of the most memorable landmark events
   of the Civil Rights Movement from 1963-1965.

     Mississippi Goddam, the iconic protest song, encapsulates the
     profound turmoil of 1963: the murder of Medgar Evers in Mississippi,
     the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Alabama, and the
     attacks by vicious dogs against the non-violent freedom
     fighters--throughout the South. Nina Simone paints a stark picture
     of the price paid by many innocent victims as well as courageous
     fighters on the frontline of the struggle for Civil Rights.



WATCH

     Nina Simone [138]performing Mississippi Goddam in Holland in 1965
     Fifty years later, Nina Simone brings to life the history of an era
     like no other, a time when people stood up ready to die for change.
     Without excuse or apology, Simone's song stands as a powerful
     indictment against an unjust and racist society.--Clarisse Rosaz
     Shariyf, Programs Manager

LEARN

     The Civil Rights Movement teaches students the power of the people
     when they organize and act collectively towards a goal. Teaching the
     history of the movement to young people help them understand how our
     democratic rights can be exercised even when they are opposed and
     fully grasp how true change requires the engagement of the young,
     old, educated, workers, everybody--in unity.--Deirdre Hollman,
     Director of Education and the Junior Scholars Program
