Conservation agriculture lessons help West African farmers maximize their
resources

   Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences Professor Ozzie Abaye said she
   sees a bigger purpose in her work with silage and animals -- helping a
   country feed itself.

   Abaye, an expert in crop production and grassland management in the
   [83]College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, has worked in Senegal to
   set up a project in conservation agriculture. Conservation agriculture
   uses cover crops, crop rotation, and minimal tillage to improve soil
   health and increase crop production.

   The project is part of a larger, Virginia Tech-led program called
   [84]Education and Research in Agriculture in Senegal that is
   modernizing agriculture in the West African country.

   "We noticed that the villagers' practice was to move livestock out of
   the village during the growing season so that they don't disturb the
   row crops," Abaye said. "But during the rainy season, we discovered
   there's lots of forage that wasn't being used."

   Because Senegal has just one rainy period a year, Abaye said it was
   important to maximize forage production during the rainy season so
   livestock would have food in the dry season.

   Of several techniques that Abaye introduced to farmers, the practice of
   using reusable plastic bags to compress and store chopped foliage
   proved to be the most popular. "The prospect of preserving forage for
   use during the dry period appeared very exciting to many of the
   farmers," Abaye said. The technique protects the fodder from the
   elements, which can rob it of nutrients. The method is also easy and
   inexpensive to adopt.

   Livestock is important in Senegal because cows, goats, sheep, and
   donkeys contribute milk, meat, and labor to the local economy, Abaye
   said. Donkeys are relied on for transportation. Yet villagers, who
   often have no more than an elementary school education, may not be
   aware of the most effective techniques of growing feed for their
   animals. "We all need to learn new tools," Abaye said.

   Originally from Ethiopia, Abaye came to the United States as a
   17-year-old exchange student, landing on a farm in rural Pennsylvania.
   Like her new siblings, she was expected to get up at 4 a.m. to milk the
   cows, go to school, come home and grab a snack, then head out to help
   with the afternoon milking. "It was hard at first," Abaye said. "I used
   to cry about it. I thought life in the United States was supposed to be
   easy. But now I understand the value of hard work -- the satisfaction
   it brings you."

   Abaye completed a doctoral degree in agronomy, now called crop and soil
   environmental sciences, at Virginia Tech in May 1992 and began teaching
   on the Blacksburg campus that July. She has been at Virginia Tech since
   then.

   Colleagues testify to her dedication and commitment. "Ozzie is one of
   those people with boundless energy," said Wade Thomason, a fellow Crop
   and Soil Environmental Sciences professor. "She really cares about the
   students and seeing the light bulb come on with them. She has that
   gift, to stay with a student until they get it."

   Patrick Guilbaud, director of the Education and Research in Agriculture
   program based in Dakar, likewise acknowledges the value that Abaye
   brings to the table. "She is helping us extend the walls of the
   university, both back in the states and here in Senegal. She's helping
   us train the next generation of leaders."

   Patrick Trail, a graduate student in crop and environmental sciences
   from Grand Gaube, Mauritius, works on the conservation agriculture
   project with Abaye. "She really encourages me to think about the needs
   of the farmer. It's easy to suggest a certain practice for the farmer,
   but people often don't think about the extra work it means for him and
   his family."

   Additionally, Trail said, "It's always fun going out to the villages to
   meet farmers with Ozzie. They never know what to make of a woman
   showing them better ways to do things, but they soon get over it once
   they realize she has much to offer."

About the project

   Professor Ozzie Abaye's project is one facet of a larger program,
   [86]Education and Research in Agriculture in Senegal, that is part of a
   U.S. government initiative called [87]Feed the Future. The latter works
   to ensure that developing countries around the world can feed
   themselves.

   The program in Senegal is funded by the [88]U.S. Agency for
   International Development and managed by Virginia Tech's [89]Office of
   International Research, Education, and Development.

   The program works with other American universities to modernize
   agriculture education in Senegal:
     * University of Connecticut
     * Michigan State University
     * Purdue University
     * Tuskegee University
