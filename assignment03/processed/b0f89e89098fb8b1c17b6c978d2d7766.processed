   [58]Careers at NPR

Applying at NPR

   June 04, 2013 4:17 PM

   NPR Applicant Experience Pledge

   So, you're thinking about applying for a job at NPR? Excellent choice!
   We applaud your great taste and decision-making skills. Since the
   application process can be shrouded at times behind generic email
   addresses that seem to go down a black hole, let's pull back the
   curtain a bit and give you a glimpse into what you can expect from NPR
   every step of the way, from application to interview to job offer.

   Talent Wanted: Apply Here
   Let's start with the basics. When positions open up, the description
   and applicant requirements are posted in [59]our career portal site.
   Through this site you can search for openings by keyword, location and
   division. This is also where you will submit your application
   (including resume, cover letter and any additional materials)
   electronically. By creating a login and password you'll be able to
   check your application status at any time throughout the process.
   Pretty simple.

   Application Review Process: People, Not Robots
   You are human. We are human. Call us crazy, but we think that actual
   people make the best decisions when it comes to evaluating a resume.
   When reviewing your application, we don't rely on robots or
   keyword-matching software to select the strongest candidates. We rely
   on humans. Most often, this human is a member of the recruiting or HR
   team. Sometimes it's the hiring manager or someone who works closely
   with the hiring manager. In short, the people who know most about the
   position are reviewing each application to find the best candidates for
   the job.

   Our goal is to review all applications within two to four weeks of
   submission. On average, we receive 200 applications per role, and we
   review them all. Sometimes it may take us a bit longer due to volume
   and/or unexpected circumstances, but delays beyond four weeks are an
   exception.

   Check Your Status, Anytime
   Your time is valuable, so we do our best to review applications and
   provide feedback in a timely manner. At any time, you can review the
   status of your application by logging into your profile in our career
   portal site. If you're not selected for any reason, you'll see that in
   your status. This is our effort to keep applicants informed in
   real-time. In addition, when the position closes, we will send you an
   email formally letting you know the position has been filled.

   Interview and Beyond
   If your application is selected to move to the next stage of the
   interview process, a member of the hiring team will reach out to you to
   conduct an introductory interview, usually over the phone.

   When scheduling your phone and on-site meetings we'll be as flexible
   and accommodating as possible. Most of our roles require one on-site
   interview. Some require two. There may be rare instances when a third
   interview is required. That typically only happens for senior roles
   with a variety of stakeholders; it also means we really like you.

Have Questions?

   Email: [62]employment@npr.org
   Tweet Us: [63]@nprjobs

   Q: I applied to a position but want to change my cover letter or upload
   an updated resume. How do I do that?
   A: You can update your resume or upload your cover letter by logging
   back at this [64]link under the "Returning Users" section, then
   clicking on "Update My Profile". If you are interested in applying for
   multiple jobs, be sure to name the cover letters to correspond with the
   specific job(s) title.

   Q: I forgot my password. How do I retrieve it?
   A: You should make sure you use your e-mail address as your username.
   Log into our career site at this [65]link and click "Retrieve Password"
   to retrieve.

   Q: During my application I checked the box that I'd be interested in
   other opportunities in public media. What does that mean?
   A: At times, we may work with our Member Stations to help them find
   great talent for open roles. Checking this box lets us know you're
   interested in other public media opportunities, and open to us
   potentially sharing your resume with stations for future consideration.

   Q: I really want to work for NPR but don't have radio experience. How
   do I get that?
   A: Working or volunteering with your local Member Station is a great
   way to gain experience in public radio.

   Q: If I work for NPR, am I required to use a tote bag?
   A: No, tote bags are entirely optional.

   After the interviews, we'll conduct reference checks and a background
   check verifying employment, education, and any record of criminal
   conviction.

   Once that's clear, we'll present a competitive offer (see below). Then
   it's up to you: we hope you'll accept, given the excellent
   decision-making skills references in the introduction.

   If you aren't selected for the job, don't give up. Our hiring needs are
   constantly evolving and we have new openings regularly. You can log-in
   and [66]create an agent on our career site to be notified via email of
   future openings based on criteria you set.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Equal Opportunity

   NPR is an [67]Equal Opportunity Employer. We work hard to solicit
   candidates from a variety of sources to attract job applicants of
   diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities and veterans.
   All candidates are evaluated solely on their qualifications to perform
   the work required.

   Privacy and Confidentiality
   Applicants are entitled to the security and confidentiality of their
   personal and professional background and data. Any decision to make
   that data available to others must be at the specific request, or with
   approval, of the applicant.

   Compensation Clarity
   When you apply to a job with NPR, we owe it to you to set clear
   expectations around compensation ranges. These ranges are based on
   market data, internal equity, and are commensurate with experience. Our
   union positions have clear compensation levels set by the SAG/AFTRA and
   NABET contracts.

   Respect
   You deserve respect, and will be treated accordingly throughout the
   application and interview process. We will make every effort to provide
   consistent communications regarding the status of your candidacy,
   regardless of the outcome of your application.
