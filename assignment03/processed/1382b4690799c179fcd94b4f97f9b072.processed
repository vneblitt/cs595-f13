Explore Ancient Cave Dwellings at Tonta National Monument

   [56]image

   Summer is a great time to take advantage of our national parks and
   monuments. Many offer free or low-cost admissions and programs perfect
   for families. So this summer we will be featuring one of our country's
   public lands every week and highlighting things you and your family can
   do there.

Tonto National Monument

   Monument. Photo from the National Park Service.

   In Northeastern section of the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, ancient Cliff
   dwellings are impeccably preserved at [57]Tonto National Monument.
   These cliff dwellings house structures that once were filled with
   ancient people during the 13th,14th and 15th centuries. When you visit
   Tonto, you get to step back in time and learn how prehistoric people
   thrived in the harsh desert climate.

   When you arrive at Tonto National Monument be sure to stop by and check
   out the visitors center. At the visitors center you can watch an 18
   minute video about Tonto's past as well as look at the different
   artifacts found during archaeological excavation.

   Once you leave the visitors center you have a variety of different
   trails you can explore and outdoor activities you can tackle. While
   tours are only available from November-April at the Upper Cliff
   Dwelling you can still visit the [58]Lower Cliff Dwelling, only a half
   mile walk from the visitors center, year round.

   Situated within a cave, the Lower Cliff Dwelling houses the former
   prehistoric home of the "Salado" people and have been the focus of many
   archaeological excavations. For more than 100 years visitors of Tonto
   have been able to walk through the different rooms and structures.
   Before visiting these structures be sure to read the [59]site etiquette
   guide.

   Tonto National Monument is also a great place to enjoy the unique
   desert climate. The Sonoran Desert surprisingly holds a variety of
   different plant and animal life.  As you would expect, cacti are
   plentiful, but there are also trees and shrubs as well as an abundance
   of beautiful wildflowers. Explore the Cactus Patch trail to learn more
   about the plant life found in the Sonoran Desert.

   A variety of animals also call Tonto home. There are more than 160
   species of birds, 26 species of land animals, including badgers and
   bobcats and 14 species of bats including the big brown bat!

   Year-round there is always plenty to see and do at Tonto National
   Monument!
