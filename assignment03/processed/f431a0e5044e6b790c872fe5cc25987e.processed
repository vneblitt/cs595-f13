The Council Network

   Posted by [86]Mike Madden on Sep. 6, 2013 at 8:39 am

   Ward 6 Councilmember and [87]would-be Mayor Tommy Wells will take his
   campaign to Reddit this week, with an [88]Ask Me Anything discussion
   scheduled for Sunday. Which got us thinking: What would be the social
   networks of choice for other local political figures?

   Marion Barry

   Who: Ward 8 Councilmember Marion Barry

   What: [89]Twitter

   Why: From [90]old SNCC photos to [91]live updates on Scandal, Barry's
   Twitter feed is already one of the best in the District.

   Jack Evans

   Who: Ward 2 Councilmember (and [92]mayoral candidate) Jack Evans

   What: [93]Pinterest

   Why: [94]Evans loves photos of celebrities, politicians, local
   bigwigs--anyone, really, as long as they're posing with Evans. The 266
   photos on his John A. Wilson Building office wall are perfect for the
   image-heavy site. Plus, he can collect ideas for new office furniture.

   Muriel Bowser

   Who: Ward 4 Councilmember (and [95]mayoral candidate) Muriel Bowser

   What: [96]LinkedIn

   Why: Bowser's businesslike, on-message mayoral campaign would fit right
   in with the corporate-focused networking site. (But will voters ignore
   her appeals like users do connection requests?)

   Ron Moten

   Who: Former [97]Adrian Fenty confidante Ron Moten

   What: [98]Soundcloud

   Why: Moten's "Go-Go for Fenty" campaign put out some of D.C.'s best new
   music during the 2010 election, even if the anthem [99]"Don't Leave Us
   Fenty" didn't turn out to move many votes.

   Vince Gray

   Who: Mayor Vince Gray

   What: [100]StrikeBaseball.com

   Why: It calls itself a "diverse community of baseball players, coaches,
   parents and instructors." Where better for the [101]ex-pro-prospect
   mayor to distract himself from [102]federal investigations?

   David Grosso

   Who: At-Large Councilmember [103]David Grosso

   What: [104]Headbuzz.org

   Why: "Social networking for pot smokers and stoners," Headbuzz will let
   Grosso reconnect with his youthful days following the Grateful Dead
   around the country (and getting busted on a [105]misdemeanor weed
   charge in Florida 20 years ago).
