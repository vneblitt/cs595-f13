Navy Yard Shooting Kills 12 People; One Shooter Dead

   Posted by [86]Perry Stein on Sep. 16, 2013 at 8:55 am

   Navy Yard Shooting: Vince Gray and Cathy Lanier Speak

   Several people were shot and killed in the headquarters of the Naval
   Sea Systems Command in the Navy Yard this morning. The shooter is dead,
   according to the Metropolitan Police Department. One MPD officer and
   two other victims were taken to Washington Hospital Center for
   treatment. About 3,000 people work in the headquarters. See below for
   updates.

   Update, 4:36 p.m. The FBI has revealed the identity of the shooter who
   was killed earlier today. He was [87]34-year-old Aaron Alexis of Fort
   Worth, Texas, and the FBI has [88]posted information about him here. At
   a press conference, Valerie Parlave, the FBI assistant director in
   charge of the Washington field office, said anyone with information
   about Alexis should contact the bureau. "We are looking to learn
   everything we can about his recent movements, his contacts, and his
   associates," she said.

   Mayor Vince Gray said that the number of fatalities is now 13,
   following the death of one victim in a hospital. He reiterated that
   officials do not know the shooter's motive.

   MPD Chief Cathy Lanier said after the first shots were reported this
   morning, MPD officers were on the scene within two to three minutes, at
   which point security within Navy Yard had already engaged the shooter.
   Within seven minutes, Lanier says, an "active shooter team" was in the
   building and had "multiple engagements" with the shooter, the last of
   which resulted in his death.

   Update, 3:16 p.m. An MPD spokesman says the white man in the tan outfit
   is neither a suspect nor a person of interest. However, MPD is still
   searching for a person described as a black man with graying sideburns
   in an olive uniform.

   Also, tonight's Washington Nationals game at Nationals Park, just a few
   blocks from the shooting, has been postponed until tomorrow at 1 p.m.

   Update, 2:20 p.m. At a press conference, Mayor Vince Gray and Police
   Chief Cathy Lanier said there are at least 12 fatalities. "We have no
   known motive," said Gray, adding that they have "no reason" to think
   this morning's shootings were acts of terrorism.

   Lanier said MPD is searching for two potential suspects in addition to
   a shooter who was killed. She described one as a white male in a
   beret-style hat between 40 and 50 years of age, who was wearing a tan
   military-style uniform consistent with U.S. Navy garb; and a black male
   of medium complexion with gray sideburns, who was wearing an olive
   uniform, has gray sideburns, and who is about 5 foot 10 inches and 180
   pounds. She said investigators do not know if the suspects are members
   of  the Armed Forces.

   Asked why the men are suspects, Lanier said, "Right now we have
   multiple pieces of information that would suggestion we have at least
   two other individuals with firearms," adding, "We have reason to
   believe that these people may be involved, and we need to talk to
   them."

   Lanier said the FBI has taken the lead on the investigation, and that
   anyone with information should call 1-800-CALL-FBI.

   Another press conference is scheduled for 4 p.m., and officials have
   asked residents to stay clear of the Navy Yard area. "We are still
   doing an extensive search," Lanier said. "The remainder of the search
   could take a couple of hours."

   Update, 12:20 p.m. MPD Chief Cathy Lanier says one shooter is dead, and
   Mayor Vince Gray says "as far as we know, this is an isolated
   incident." Multiple victims are also dead, Lanier says. Police are
   still looking for what could be two more shooters, one a black man
   wearing an olive-drab military-style uniform, the other a white man
   wearing a short-sleeve khaki Navy-style uniform. "The big concern for
   us right now is that we potentially have two other shooters that we
   have not located at this point," Lanier told a press conference near
   the Navy Yard. "This is not confirmed... We have no information to
   believe either of those folks are military personnel, but we do have
   information that both of them are wearing military uniforms." If you
   see them, call police.

   Update, 12:01 p.m. The Navy says family members of people who work in
   the building can call for information:

     Family members looking for information about their loved ones can
     call 202-433-6151 or 202-433-9713. [89]#NavyYardShooting

     -- U.S. Navy (@USNavy) [90]September 16, 2013

   Update, 11:50 a.m. MPD spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump says reports that
   there was also a shooting at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling are false:
   "There was no shooting at Bolling."

   Update, 11:38 a.m. Three victims are at Washington Hospital Center, one
   an MPD officer and two civilians, Chief Medical Officer Janis
   Orlowski told a press conference there. All three are alert, but "they
   do have severe injuries." The MPD officer, a man, has gunshot wounds to
   his legs. One of the civilians, a woman, has a gunshot wound in her
   shoulder; the other has gunshot wounds in her head and hands. "Their
   chances of survival are very good," Orlowski says.

   Update, 10:51 a.m. A Metro spokeswoman says MPD requested at least four
   Metro buses to transport witnesses, which the transit agency has
   provided.

   Update, 10:37 a.m. A spokeswoman for Navy Public Affairs confirms there
   have been multiple fatalities. The Washington Post is reporting
   [91]that four are dead.

   Update, 9:58 a.m. A spokeswoman for MPD says 10 people have been shot.
   MPD describes the shooter, who is "still active," as a black male
   around six feet tall and 170 pounds wearing a black shirt and hat.

   Update, 9:35 a.m. [92]According to the Washington Post, an MPD officer
   was shot near a room where the shooter has barricaded himself. Police
   confirmed "multiple injuries" to City Desk, and said that the incident
   is still "active." Several news outlets are reporting that MPD says at
   least four people have been shot.

   Original post: At least least one person was shot this morning at the
   headquarters of Naval Sea Systems Command in Navy Yard, [93]according
   to the U.S. Navy. The Metropolitan Police Department and the Fire and
   Emergency Shooter Department are currently on the scene in on M Street
   SE responding to the "active shooting," according to D.C. officials.

   The police department confirmed at least one victim, though the D.C.
   Fire Fighters Association [94]tweeted at around 8:40 a.m. that there
   were multiple victims. According to the U.S. Navy's Twitter feed, the
   shooter is [95]"still active" as of 8:51 a.m.

   A U.S. Navy press release says a "shelter in place" order has been
   issued for Navy Yard personnel. About 3,000 people work in the Naval
   Sea Systems Command's headquarters.

   Due to an editing error, the post originally reported at least three
   people were shot, when, at the time, just one injury had been
   confirmed.
