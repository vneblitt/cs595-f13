   Sungwon Choi, 14, describes how he and his mother escaped from their
   ninth-floor apartment during an early morning fire in Glenview by
   climbing down a firefighter's ladder. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune)
   By Alexandra Chachkevitch Tribune reporter

   8:11 p.m. CDT, September 11, 2013

   Time seemed to slow for 14-year-old Sungwon Choi as he climbed down a
   100-foot ladder to escape a fire early Wednesday on the ninth floor of
   his Glenview condo building.

   "There were times I was so nervous I couldn't move," he said. "I was so
   high up in the sky."

   With thick smoke blocking their exit through the hallway, Choi and his
   mother were stuck on the balcony of their two-bedroom unit next door to
   the blaze. They yelled and waved for help.

   Firefighters rescued them several minutes after the fire broke out
   around 12:30 a.m. at 3925 Triumvera Drive, said Glenview fire Chief
   Wayne Globerger.

   Choi said that during the ordeal it felt like a 20-minute climb down
   the ladder, but he estimated from the safety of firm ground that it
   probably took less than five minutes.

   About 40 firefighters worked to extinguish the fire, evacuating every
   resident from the 16-story building, Globerger said. No one needed
   treatment at a hospital, the chief noted.

   The cause of the fire is under investigation. It started in a bedroom
   on the ninth floor. The man who lived in the unit left himself,
   Globerger said.

   The chief said the fire caused about $500,000 in damage to the
   building, mainly affecting two units on the ninth floor and one on the
   eighth floor.

   After a sleepless and stressful night, Choi, his mother and some other
   residents were greeted by soaked carpets, smoky air and ash-covered
   furniture once they were allowed to go back into their units. The
   teen's mother declined to be interviewed and asked not to be named.

   "It was a total disaster," Choi said, adding that his unit's floor was
   covered with water. "I didn't expect so much water."

   He said he and his mother, who have lived in the unit for about two
   years, will have to repaint walls and replace their carpets and a
   window.

   Choi, a Glenbrook South High School student, took off from class
   Wednesday to help his mother gather some of their belongings. Then they
   headed for a hotel. He's happy no one was hurt and expressed gratitude
   that the firefighters helped him and his mother evacuate.

   Other residents also were glad to be alive.

   Diane Davis, 54, who also lives on the ninth floor, said the loud
   banging of firefighters at her door woke her up. "I thought it was all
   in my dream," she said, adding that firefighters were about to break
   down the door when she finally roused.

   As Davis later examined her plants and other belongings for damage, she
   said she was grateful for the firefighters' efforts. "It was great that
   we all made it out."

   Local firefighters had a busy night. Globerger said they had to
   extinguish another fire before the Triumvera fire.

   At about 9 p.m. Tuesday, crews responded to a blaze at Castino
   Restoration and Home Services, 2820 Old Willow Road in Northbrook.
   Globerger said no one was in that building and firefighters were on the
   scene until about midnight -- and were called to the Glenview location
   a few minutes later.
