   Where to VotePolling places are located throughout the city. You can
   vote ONLY at your designated polling place. Make sure your are at the
   correct polling site and Election District/Assembly District (ED/AD)
   for your address.
   Polling Places open 6:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M. If you are not sure of that
   location you can find you poll site location by:
     * Search with the [69]Online Poll Site Address Locator
     *  Call the Voter Phone Bank at 1.866.VOTE.NYC
     *  [70]E-mail your complete home address to us at vote@boe.nyc.ny.us
       and we'll e-mail your polling place location back to you. (Please
       put in the subject line the borough in which you reside.)

   Making the Polls Accessible
   The Board has made a concerted effort to increase the polling place
   accessibility for senior citizens and handicapped voters by removing
   physical barriers to the voting area at New York City polling sites.
   The effort includes:
     * Installation of curb cuts to assist voters with wheelchairs in
       gaining access from street level
     * Construction of building ramps or temporary ramps for voters with
       canes or wheelchairs
     * Miscellaneous repairs to doors, handrails, light fixtures, and
       walkways

   In some cases, polling places have been relocated to more accessible
   buildings within the same Election District. 99% of all city polling
   sites are now barrier free, however, problems remain at some sites.
   Voters who feel that their site is inaccessible may [71]call the Voter
   Registration Unit of their local Borough office for information.
