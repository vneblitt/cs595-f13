Envisioning Earth from Space Before We Went There

   September 12, 2013 by [14]Jennifer Harbster

   The following is a guest post from Trevor Owens, Special Curator for
   the Library of Congress Science Literacy Initiative and Digital
   Archivist in the Office of Strategic Initiatives.Â

   Few images are as powerful as the[15] 1968 Apollo 8 Earthrise photo and
   the [16]1990 Pale Blue Dot photo from [17]Voyager 1. Seeing the Earth
   from space makes us appreciate just how small our world is. What you
   might not know is that there are scientific and artistic illustrations
   that anticipated these photographs. In this post I share a few examples
   of how books and magazines from over one hundred years ago envisioned
   the view of Earth from outer space.

   Aspect of an eclipse of the sun by the earth, as it would appear as
   seen from the moon by J. Nasmyth. From The moon: considered as a
   planet, a world, and a satellite by James Nasmyth and James Carpenter
   (1874)

An Eclipse of the Sun by the Earth, 1874

   The image to the right comes from the 1874 book [18]The moon:
   considered as a planet, a world, and a satelliteÂ (seeÂ [19]1885
   edition for the digital copy) by James Nasmyth and James Carpenter. The
   images in this book are mostly photographs of plaster models based on
   observations of amateur astronomer James Nasmyth. Most of the images in
   this book are modeled on their direct observations, but this one
   represents the view of the Earth from the moon. Part of considering the
   moon as a world, a place like Earth, required this kind of shift in
   perspective. Seeing the Earth eclipse the sun from the Moon makes it
   feel much more like a real world.

   The Earth Viewed from Mercury, p. 119. From Astronomy for Amateurs by
   Camille Flammarion (1904)

The Earth Viewed from Mercury, 1904

   French Astronomer Camille Fammarion wrote a range of popular astronomy
   books in the later half of the 19^th century. Fammarion was fond of
   including images of the Earth from other vantage points in the heavens
   in these books. This one, from an 1904 English translation of
   [20]Astronomy for Amateurs, shows the Earth as it would appear from the
   surface of Mercury. The little arrow points to where the Earth would be
   to any of the creatures on Mercury that might look out towards us.

   Near the image, Fammarion notes of the planet Mercury, âwe may well
   imagine that Natureâs fecundity can have engendered beings there of an
   organization different from our own, adapted to an existence in the
   proximity of fire. What magnificent landscapes may there be adorned
   with luxuriant vegetation that develops rapidly under an ardent and
   generous sun.â

   Fammarionâs use of images of how small Earth would look from other
   planets work to reinforce the point of much of his writings-that there
   are likely beings like us on other worlds in this and other solar
   systems.

   The most important thing in the universe by L.M. Glackens. Cover from
   Puck, v. 60, November 7, 1906.

The Most Important Thing in the Universe, 1906

   Outer space views of Earth arenât limited to science and popular
   science works. Showing Earth from space has long been a way to show how
   something that might seem very significant up close is at a distance
   not a particularly big deal. In this cartoon from the humor
   magazine[21] Puck, we find a perspective on Earth from Mars.

   This cartoon shows two Martians yawning and expressing relief that
   Charles Evans Hughes has been elected governor of New York. We can see
   fireworks marking the celebration back in New York from our point of
   observation on Mars. The caption reads in part âWe can get a little
   sleep now that we know how the New York election came out.â Some New
   Yorkers might not think they are at the center of the universe, but
   here their state politics are being watched with considerable
   anticipation from 40-300 million miles away.

   The Earth, the Moon and its inhabitants as seen from planet Mars
   through a huge telescope, pg. 48. From Trip to Mars by Marcianus
   Filomeno Rossi (1920)

A Trip to Mars, 1920

   In the 1920 science fiction story, [22]A Trip to Mars, we find an image
   of âThe Earth, the Moon and its inhabitants as seen from planet Mars
   through a huge telescope.â

   In this peculiar novel, a crew of explorers set out to visit Mars on a
   solar powered space craft. When they arrive, they find the planet is
   apparently home to the decedents of an ancient Roman civilization.
   Their captain is asked to give names to canals on the planet and
   chooses to name them for Schiaparelli (credited with having first
   observed the alleged canals on Mars) and Fammarion (who weâve already
   discussed as a popularizer of the idea of life on other worlds).

Earth from Space: What Do You Think?

   Do you have additional examples of representations of Earth from space?
   What do you think they say about what these images mean to us? And, do
   you have any further thoughts on what the four images Iâve shared mean?
   Please consider posting them in a comment.

       "Space artists" still play an important role in doing exactly this,
       i.e., "envisioning Earth from space before we went there. Some of
       my favorites are Chesley Bonestall (deceased), Robert McCall (also
       deceased), and (especially for their visions of Mars) Kim Poor and
       Pat Rawlings. Take a look at the following web site for many other
       examples !

       I had the "Peace on Earth" poster of that Apollo 8 earthrise on my
       wall all through high school and college!
