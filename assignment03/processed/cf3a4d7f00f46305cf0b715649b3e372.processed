   By Mary Ellen Podmolik Tribune staff reporter

   10:26 a.m. CDT, September 12, 2013
   Foreclosure activity in the Chicago area in August plunged from a year
   ago as the housing market continues its slow recovery, but Cook County
   did see activity increase from July, according to data released
   Thursday.
   Last month, 6,674 properties in the Chicago area received a notice of
   foreclosure activity, a decline of 5.7 percent from July and down 59
   percent from August 2012, RealtyTrac reported.
   In RealtyTrac's data, the boundaries of the Chicago area extend to
   Southeast Wisconsin and Northwest Indiana.
   Foreclosure activity in Cook County, the state's most populous county,
   declined 55 percent from a year ago, but the 4,078 foreclosure notices
   issued in August represented a 7 percent increase from July. However,
   the month-over-month gain was not in new foreclosure cases started.
   Instead, it was in properties that were already in the foreclosure
   pipeline and either were sent notices of a court-ordered sale of the
   property or notices that the property had been repossessed.
   The decline in foreclosure starts locally mirrored trends seen
   elsewhere. Nationally, foreclosure starts fell 8 percent in August from
   a year ago, to their lowest level since December 2005, Overall
   foreclosure filings in August were down 2 percent from July and down 34
   percent from August 2012.
