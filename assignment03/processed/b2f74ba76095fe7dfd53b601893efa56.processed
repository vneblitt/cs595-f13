     "Extraordinary challenges require extraordinary responses.  A
     generation ago, the world's nations agreed to act definitively to
     protect the ozone layer, initiating an inter-governmental process
     that blazed new trails. "

2013 Theme: A healthy atmosphere, the future we want

   In 1994, the UN General Assembly proclaimed 16 September the
   International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer,
   commemorating the date of the signing, in 1987, of the Montreal
   Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer ([22]resolution
   49/114).

   States were invited to devote the Day to promote activities in
   accordance with the objectives of the Protocol and its amendments. The
   ozone layer, a fragile shield of gas, protects the Earth from the
   harmful portion of the rays of the sun, thus helping preserve life on
   the planet.

   The phaseout of controlled uses of ozone depleting substances and the
   related reductions have not only helped protect the ozone layer for
   this and future generations, but have also contributed significantly to
   global efforts to address climate change; furthermore, it has protected
   human health and ecosystems by limiting the harmful ultraviolet
   radiation from reaching the earth.
