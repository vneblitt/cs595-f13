   Venric Mark hasn't relinquished his throne as king of Northwestern's
   read option, but in his absence, NU has added to its court.

   Mark sat out his second straight game Saturday against Western Michigan
   with what the team is calling a lower-body injury. He played sparingly
   in the season opener at Cal and has been a limited participant in
   practice since.

   In stepped junior Treyvon Green, who carried the ball 20 times for 158
   yards and two touchdowns in a 38-17 victory. It was Green's second game
   of more than 100 yards rushing this season.

   ``He had a really good bowl practice and offseason,'' coach Pat
   Fitzgerald said. ``He's probably in the best shape of his career here.
   He had an attitude and a look in his eyes that he was not happy with
   his role here.''

   With Mark out, the thought was that NU would suffer most when it came
   to the read option. The speedy combination of Mark and quarterback Kain
   Colter made it difficult to defend last season.

   The Wildcats didn't have anybody on their roster as fast as Mark. But
   Green not only has shown the ability to turn perimeter runs into big
   gains, he has used his 5-10, 215-pound frame to punish teams between
   the tackles.

   Already he has runs of 55 and 42 yards this season, the latter going
   for a touchdown Saturday.

   Even when Mark returns, Green has done enough to be NU's power runner
   long-term. He already has unseated senior Mike Trumpy, who was expected
   to fill that role.

   Trumpy lost a fumble in the third quarter Saturday and only had eight
   carries on a night when NU ran the ball 55 times.

   "Trey has been really solid here for the first three weeks of the
   season. Been really impressed by him," Fitzgerald said. ``He's looking
   like a much faster, stronger Trey Green that was here for us as a
   freshman.

   ``It's more about the skill set he can bring and what he can do [as
   opposed to who is healthy]."

   NU has been coy about the situation with Mark. Fitzgerald said Mark
   left camp ``close to 100 percent'' but has classified him as day to day
   since the Cal game, in which he played in the fourth quarter.

   On Saturday, NU burned the redshirt of freshman running back Warren
   Long despite having used four other running backs in the game. That
   gives reason to speculate that Mark's injury may be more serious than
   originally thought.

   Asked if he would have used Long if Mark were healthy, Fitzgerald said
   it was a hypothetical he couldn't answer. He did say Long has played
   well in practice and that using him had nothing to do with depth
   concerns.

   Long initially played on special teams but carried the ball twice for
   13 yards in the second half.
