Atop the Amazon rainforest

Harvard scientist, others study how pristine air becomes polluted, and how
that may change climate

   August 28, 2013 | Editor's Pick Audio/Video

   Ned Brown/Harvard Staff
   By Colleen Walsh, Harvard Staff Writer

   This is third in a [83]series of stories about Harvard's engagement in
   Latin America.

   MANAUS, Brazil -- Walking along a path in the Amazon rainforest,
   several overheated travelers come across a copper-colored brook
   rippling under a mossy wooden bridge. It's an inviting sight. But the
   beckoning waters could well camouflage a deadly predator.

   "The huge snake the anaconda loves to stay in these small rivers," said
   Bruno Takeshi, a tall, unflappable Brazilian, referring to the massive
   reptile that squeezes the life out of its prey.

   On this steamy afternoon in early August, Takeshi, who studies how
   changes in soil relate to climate science, and his collaborators,
   Harvard Professor [84]Scot Martin and Martin's Ph.D. student Suzane
   Simões de Sá, don't linger by the river. Instead, they continue their
   twisting trek through the thick forest ringing with the songs of unseen
   insects and birds, until they reach their incongruous goal, a 177-foot
   aluminum tower.

   The tower is used in climate research, and resembles a number of such
   structures that will soon be part of a massive, coordinated campaign to
   track something that, over decades, could prove more deadly than the
   Amazon's anacondas, something that floats invisibly, high above the
   pristine jungle: air pollution.

   Brown/Harvard Staff

   The research project is called [85]GreenOceanAmazon2014 (GoAmazon2014),
   a collaboration among the[86] U.S. Department of Energy and several
   Brazilian and other international partners. The program, for which
   Takeshi is project manager, studies the environmental impact of a
   growing pollution plume generated in Manaus, Brazil, a burgeoning
   industrial center carved from the dense forest.

   A busy city near an unbroken forest

   Researchers hope to ascertain how the city's smog is affecting some of
   the cleanest air in the world, changing cloud formation and rainfall in
   the region, and influencing global climate change. For scientists, the
   busy city encircled by miles of unbroken forest is a perfect natural
   laboratory, a kind of controlled experiment.

   "Manaus is a great test bed. It's an isolated urban region with 2,000
   kilometers of forest around it," said Martin, Harvard's Gordon McKay
   Professor of Environmental Chemistry, the principal investigator for
   the project. In "most places, there are so many possible pollution
   sources, it's very difficult to dissect and interpret the data. Here,
   it's a much more straightforward experiment, given there's only one
   major pollution source."

   On the hike to the tower, Martin pauses occasionally to wipe steam from
   his wire-rimmed glasses. In his checked shirt, khaki shorts, black
   sneakers, and bright yellow Brazilian national soccer team cap, he
   looks less like a jungle explorer than a casual tourist who took a
   wrong turn in the woods. But he is as comfortable and confident in this
   rugged environment as any whip-wielding Indiana Jones.

   Climbing the tower as it sways with the wind is not for the faint of
   heart. Slim aluminum scaffolding connects a series of equally thin
   platforms and ladders. For the first-time climber, the ground
   disappears at an alarming rate during the ascent as the green leaves of
   hundreds of species of trees quickly swallow the brown forest floor.
   Higher up, the incessant buzz of the jungle is replaced by a calm
   silence, the heat eased by a steady breeze. At the top, above the tree
   canopy, the view is of a "green ocean," an endless expanse of emerald
   in every direction.

   Martin's first Amazon climb took place in 2008 during a project called
   the Amazonian Aerosol Characterization Experiment (AMAZE08) that set
   the groundwork for the GoAmazon2014 campaign. Martin, whose research
   focuses on tiny atmospheric particles called aerosols and their impact
   on cloud formation, rainfall, and climate change, had spent years
   experimenting with the [87]Harvard Environmental Chamber, a giant,
   flexible Teflon bag within which he could study how aerosols reacted
   with things like ozone and highly reactive hydroxyl radicals to affect
   cloud formation. He was taking his first sabbatical and looking to
   branch out from the confines of his Harvard lab.

   An Amazon tower similar to the one Martin used during his 2008
   Amazonian Aerosol Characterization Experiment.

   Martin, who is married to a Brazilian, immediately thought of the Latin
   American country for his yearlong break. "I had never done any research
   outside of the laboratory before ... and if you are going to go to
   Brazil, what captures the imagination most is Amazonia." The isolated
   area was the perfect environment for studying atmospheric particles, a
   living lab with pristine air where he could explore the links between
   biological processes and climate.

   The influence of particles on climate shifts

   Martin's work is helping to illuminate a dark area in climate science.
   Though scientists have long understood the impact of carbon dioxide and
   methane gas on global warming, they know relatively little about the
   particles that Martin studies, or their possible influence on climate
   shifts and global warming trends.

   "The big uncertainties and controversy around climate change are really
   centered on these atmospheric particles," which are difficult both to
   control and to characterize, said Martin. Such particles vary widely in
   size, from 10 to 1,000 nanometers. They also have different chemical
   compositions. (Sulfate particles reflect solar radiation, while black
   soot particles mean energy gets absorbed in the atmospheric column,
   which in turn can change circulation patterns.) The particles also
   interact with clouds and can change precipitation rates.

   For years, scientists theorized that the air above the rainforest
   contained organic molecules released by plants in the forest below. The
   question, however, was whether those molecules reacted with chemicals
   in the atmosphere -- like ozone or a highly reactive molecule called
   hydroxyl radicals -- to create aerosol particles, and if and how those
   particles affected rainfall.

   During his 2008 sabbatical, Martin used a new 112-foot tower, where a
   slender copper tube sucked clean air from above the trees into a small
   steel container crammed with instruments, including the delicate mass
   spectrometer, a fine-tuned machine that can provide a fingerprint of
   the atmosphere and distinguish between primary organic molecules and
   the secondary aerosol particles they form. The results showed Martin
   and his colleagues that the aerosols did indeed come from chemical
   reactions between the organic molecules released by plants and
   chemicals in the atmosphere. Further testing and studies revealed that
   those aerosols were directly influencing levels of rainfall.

   "That sets up the background for the GoAmazon2014 experiment," Martin
   said, "because this means we can ask the question: `If emissions from
   the forest are controlling those aspects of climate, what does it mean
   when they couple to pollution?' "

   A similarly ideal condition for his current experiment -- and his
   second sabbatical -- is the proximity of Manaus. This busy industrial
   city, while bringing prosperity to many, has created a widening
   pollution plume.

   One hundred and fifty years ago, Manaus, the capital of the state of
   Amazonas, was awash in opulence, the result of a rubber boom that drew
   both workers and wealthy investors. But the city's fortunes dwindled
   after British explorer Henry Wickham smuggled thousands of rubber seeds
   out of the country in 1876, thereby ending Manaus' nearly exclusive
   control of the natural resource. After decades of poverty, Manaus
   slowly evolved again into an economic powerhouse, thanks to a decree
   making it a free-trade zone in the 1950s. Today, government tax
   exemptions and incentives have attracted a growing list of Fortune 500
   companies and their manufacturing plants. In 1970, Manaus had 500,000
   inhabitants. Now, it has close to 2 million.

   On Manaus' crowded streets, cars and motorcycles battle in daily duels
   of wit and will. Development plans displayed along the road offer a
   glimpse of the city's resurgence. A giant blue sign touts condos and
   ball fields. Nearby a massive shopping mall looms. On another busy
   stretch, large silver letters announce the industrial home of the
   electronics giant Pioneer. Farther on are a Coca-Cola plant and a
   brewery. High-rises, sprawling homes, and factories cover the ground,
   except for small sections of green where the Amazon simply refused to
   yield.

   One of the inevitable results of such size and growth -- along with
   overcrowding and a distinct disparity in resources among the population
   -- is the smog and soot that now plague the area.

   As Martin explains it, the city's primary pollutants dramatically alter
   the formation of atmospheric particles. Those changes then affect
   rainfall.

   Pollution comes mainly from sulfur and nitrogen oxides, which can
   change important chemical pathways and cause formation of many more
   tiny particles in the atmosphere. When a cloud forms, water condenses
   on background particles to form water droplets. In a pristine
   environment, there are "about 300 particles per cubic centimeter.
   Imagine, under polluted conditions, you have 3,000 particles per cubic
   centimeter," said Martin. The more particles there are per cubic
   centimeter, the smaller the water droplets are that form. And a cloud
   with smaller water droplets is more likely to evaporate than produce
   rain.

   "If you start changing the clouds and changing the hydrological cycle,
   it has big implications," said Martin. One of them involves climate
   change. "All of these are the tough issues of climate. So, in that
   context, our `slice' through it is to try to understand where the
   particles come from, what are the size of the particles, and how that
   links into cloud formation."

   Tracking the air as it migrates
   lab_570_1

   One of the many U.S. Department of Energy mobile labs that Martin and
   his collaborators will use during GoAmazon2014.

   To accomplish his task, Martin and his GoAmazon2014 partners will
   create four sites that allow them to track the air as it migrates from
   a clean environment through the city's pollution and beyond. "We will
   have one site up-wind of Manaus to measure the air parcel when it's
   clean, one in Manaus that captures the emissions, one just across the
   river from Manaus that gets the fresh pollution, and one an hour away
   from Manaus where we can get the aged pollution."

   It's that final site with which Martin is directly involved, an open
   pasture on a farm near the small city of Manacapuru. There, cordoned
   off in a field once reserved for grazing cattle, sits a 20-foot by
   10-foot white container, a mobile lab containing sensitive scientific
   equipment owned by the Energy Department. In the coming months, 14
   similar containers will arrive in advance of two intensive operating
   periods (IOPs) -- February through March and September through October
   2014 -- when the site will host upward of 50 Harvard and Brazilian
   researchers and students, working from dawn until dusk.

   Six small Department of Energy labs will sample the air. Each container
   will have a tube on its roof, consisting of a small copper wire,
   protected by a screen to filter out insects, and insulated by
   polyurethane to keep the air temperature consistent as it flows into a
   dryer that sucks away any condensation. Before the air reaches the mass
   spectrometer's container, another machine will filter out large dust
   particles that could damage the device.

   Other containers will house sensitive radar equipment that will measure
   the size of the clouds and the water they hold. Another batch of
   containers will monitor radiation levels and other phenomena. During
   the IOPs, an aircraft will regularly fly overhead, gathering more data
   on the clouds and the pollution plume.

   Still, this work is just the data-collecting phase for Martin, who
   along with his collaborators has submitted proposals for further
   funding that will, they hope, allow them to analyze the data they
   collect next year.

   "It's a multi-headed hydra that will get us across the finish line,"
   said Martin, who is quick with a laugh and quick to focus on the
   positive. "If you were here two years ago, you would know today that we
   are making progress."

   That progress could lead to key answers, as equatorial cities blossom
   in the coming decades.

   "Hopefully, we can provide a knowledge base, one that lets people
   consider transportation or energy systems that could have a
   significantly reduced effect on air quality and a reduced effect on
   climate change."
