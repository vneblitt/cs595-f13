   Inspiring Service

   HMS Physician Honored for Service to Vietnamese Children
   By OFFICE FOR ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL AFFAIRS
   September 5, 2013

   During a visit to her native country of Vietnam as a medical volunteer,
   Thanh-Nga Tran was struck by the tremendous medical and social needs of
   children with disfiguring birthmarks from hemangiomas and other
   vascular anomalies.

   "Many hemangiomas ulcerate during their growth phase, causing severe
   pain and a high risk of infection and scarring. Aside from the
   potential physical disability, psycho-social problems can occur in
   children who have been forced to live with a facial deformity during
   the formation of their initial self-image," said Tran, HMS clinical
   instructor in dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital.

   Tran's concerns for these children were augmented by their lack of
   access to modern health care and the prevalent use of outdated
   treatments that have the potential to result in further disfigurement.

   From this experience, Tran was inspired to start a free clinic to treat
   children with vascular anomalies while simultaneously educating
   Vietnamese physicians about modern treatments.

   Working with a team of collaborators from the United States and an
   established dermatologist in Vietnam, Tran co-founded the first
   vascular anomalies center in Ho Chi Minh City in 2009.

   In recognition of her efforts, Tran was recently recognized by the 2013
   Dean's Community Service Award sponsored by the [144]HMS Office for
   Diversity, Inclusion and Community Partnership.

   "The goal is to have the Vietnam vascular anomalies center closely
   model treatment centers in the U.S., where difficult cases that require
   multidisciplinary efforts are presented amongst member physicians and
   treatment options are outlined," said Tran.

   During the past five years, the center has evaluated more than 3,000
   children and treated more than 700. It has also developed an
   affiliation with the Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University
   that has facilitated international collaboration in teaching and
   research.

   For example, Tran and co-founder Richard Rox Anderson, HMS professor of
   dermatology at Mass General have recently launched a clinical trial in
   collaboration with their Vietnamese colleagues to assess whether early
   treatment of hemangiomas can prevent their subsequent growth and reduce
   the potential for disfigurement in affected children.

   Tran and her team members find continued sources of inspiration and
   personal satisfaction in the hundreds of children that they have
   successfully treated over the years.

   "We love the children. And we have learned so much in the past five
   years. The ability to learn from each other, to exchange ideas, to set
   up a clinic from scratch and see it blooming, to be able to help jump
   start research and educational programs in dermatology in Vietnam, to
   give back, to help children who would go otherwise go through life with
   disfiguring birthmarks is tremendously rewarding," said Tran.

   Tran was one of seven members of the HMS community who were recognized
   with a 2013 Dean's Community Service Award at an awards recognition
   breakfast held on June 11. Other award recipients included Nancy Oriol,
   Lifetime Achievement award recipient; Yvonne Gomez-Carrion, faculty
   award recipient; Cheri Blauwet, trainee award recipient; Benjamin
   Robbins, HMS student award recipient; Amanda Nichols and Philip Snell,
   staff award recipients.

   "The 2013 award recipients, selected from 86 outstanding nominations,
   have made tremendous contributions to diverse populations on an
   impressively broad scale, from treating vascular birth defects in
   underserved children in Vietnam, to enhancing the health and
   educational needs of Tanzania's impoverished youth," wrote Dean Jeffrey
   Flier in his [145]Dean's Corner blog. "I am honored to recognize the
   countless hours they devote to advancing our mission of outreach and
   service."
