Main Reading Room Open House on Columbus Day

   Twice each year, the Library of Congress opens its magnificent Main
   Reading Room for a special public open house. The fall open house will
   take place on the federal Columbus Day holiday, Monday, Oct. 14, from
   10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Photography will be allowed.

   The Main Reading Room is located on the first floor of the Thomas
   Jefferson Building, 10 First St., S.E., Washington, D.C. Reference
   librarians will be available to demonstrate the Libraryâs online
   resources and discuss access to the Libraryâs vast onsite collections,
   including services and collections for use in family history research.
   No other reference services will be available and all other Library of
   Congress reading rooms and buildings will be closed.

   The Jefferson Building, which will be open to the public between 8:30
   a.m. and 4:30 p.m., also features the incomparable Great Hall and the
   Library of Congress exhibitions.

   Among current exhibitions in the Jefferson building are "The Civil War
   in America" and "A Day Like No Other: Commemorating the 50th
   Anniversary of the March on Washington."

   Housed in the Southwest Gallery on the second floor through January 4,
   2014, "The Civil War in America" exhibit presents the Libraryâs
   unmatched Civil War collections. Items shown chronicle the sacrifices
   and accomplishments of those - in both the North and South - whose
   lives were lost or affected by the events of 1861â1865.

   "A Day Like No Other," which can be viewed in the Graphic Arts Gallery
   on the ground floor, transports visitors to the momentous day of the
   March on Washingtonâa day that transformed our nationâwhen 250,000
   people participated in the largest nonviolent demonstration for civil
   rights that Americans had ever witnessed. The exhibit consists of 40
   black-and-white images, part of the collections in the Libraryâs Prints
   and Photographs Division, which convey the immediacy of being at the
   march and the palpable excitement of those who were there.

   Unreserved guided tours of the Thomas Jefferson Building will be
   offered at 9:30, 10:30 and 11:30 a.m. and at 12:30, 1:30, 2:30 and 3:30
   p.m. Each tour is limited to 40 people and designed to accommodate
   individuals and families, not large groups. More information about the
   Library, the exhibitions and tours is available at the orientation
   desks at [19]www.loc.gov/visit or by calling (202) 707-8000.
