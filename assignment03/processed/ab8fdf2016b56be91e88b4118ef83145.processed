Fishing Cats

Fishing Cat Kitten Born May 17

   August 16, 2013

   Our fishing cat kitten, Wasabi, and his mom, Electra, are now on
   exhibit daily at Asia Trail's fishing cat exhibit. Lek (Wasabi's dad),
   is on exhibit in the second yard. Wasabi was born May 17, but had to
   wait to go into the outdoor exhibit until all of his vaccinations were
   up to date. Now he's having a great time exploring his exhibit, and
   Electra is clearly enjoying having a little one to play with in the
   yard.

   Electa and Wasabi are out every day by 10 a.m The time keepers bring
   them in varies and is weather dependent, but they're usually out until
   late afternoon.

   July 17, 2013

   Asia Trail curators and zoo staff have determined the sex of
   eight-week-old fishing cat kitten Wasabi--and it's a boy! Zoo
   veterinarians gave Wasabi a clean bill of health after performing a
   complete physical exam July 10 which included: listening to the
   kitten's heart and lungs; checking his mouth, eyes, legs, feet and
   genital area; and feeling his belly. Wasabi also received the first in
   a series of routine vaccinations that protect against feline distemper
   and some upper respiratory viruses. Wasabi will make his public debut
   with mother Electra later this summer. Until then Zoo visitors can see
   the kitten's father, Lek, on Asia Trail.

   fishing cat kitten exam

   July 2, 2013

   Our fishing cat kitten has a spicy personality--and a name to match!
   Animal care staff has given the kitten the name "Wasabi." Wasabi
   recently had his/her first fishing lesson with mother Electra. A
   patient mother, Electra waited until Wasabi was paying attention. She
   showed her kitten the art of pouncing and left a few fish for it to
   play with--the whole lesson took about ten minutes. After watching mom,
   Wasabi tried his/her paw at fishing with great enthusiasm! At 11 or 12
   weeks old, Wasabi will be a great fisher like Electra. For now, toys
   and mom's tail are as enticing as fish.

   kitten and keeper aides This week we have started letting our keeper
   aides meet the fishing cat kitten-as you can see, Electra's pretty
   relaxed about the whole process, but is definitely keeping an eye on
   things.  In this photo, Electra actually brought the kitten up to the
   mesh and deposited it there for social time! The kitten is a month old
   today and weighs almost exactly two pounds.

   June 13, 2013

   Our fishing cat kitten, born May 17, is growing fast! The kitten and
   its mother Electra are bonding in an off-exhibit area. Keepers have
   been monitoring the pair closely. A few days ago, Electra was
   comfortable with the keepers separating her and her kitten for a few
   moments while they weighed--750 grams and growing.

   A vet exam will take place in the next few weeks, and we hope to learn
   the kittenâs sex! Zoo visitors can see the kittenâs father Lek on Asia
   Trail.

   Fishing cat and kitten

   Just before midnight on May 17, the mewling of a newborn kitten
   delighted keepers at the National Zoo's Asia Trail. The kitten's
   mother, Electra, had two kittens last year on May 18 (see below for
   more information on last year's births).

   The adjacent photo depicts the first time that the mother escorted the
   little bundle of fur outside of the birthing den.

   Inhabiting India and Southeast Asia, fishing cat populations are
   declining and they are considered endangered.

Twin Fishing Cats Born at the National Zoo--a First

   May 18, 2012

   The Smithsonian's National Zoo is closer to cracking the code for
   breeding one of Asia's most elusive species with the birth of two
   fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus). Seven-year-old Electra
   delivered the kittens between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. May 18 in an
   off-exhibit den. Their birth marks an important milestone: this is the
   first time fishing cats have successfully bred and produced young at
   the National Zoo.

   Keepers are monitoring the mother and her offspring through a
   closed-circuit camera, allowing the family time to bond. Although the
   kittens will not make their public debut until later this summer, Zoo
   visitors can see their father, two-year-old Lek, on Asia Trail.

   "Many months of behavior watch, introductions and research allowed us
   to get to this point," said Zoo Director Dennis Kelly. "It's very
   rewarding that our efforts have paid off. The future of their wild
   cousins hangs in the balance, so it's imperative that we do all we can
   to ensure their survival."

   Before Lek arrived at the Zoo in January 2011, the Association of Zoos
   and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan for fishing cats intended to pair
   Electra with another male. The SSP scientists determine which animals
   breed by considering their genetic makeup and social needs, temperament
   and overall health. Despite meeting these criteria, the other male and
   Electra never took an interest in one another. By contrast, when
   keepers introduced Lek and Electra, the cats soon began showing signs
   of affection, such as grooming and nuzzling.

   The Zoo's three adult fishing cats are taking part in a
   multi-institutional study that examines the many facets of introducing
   a potential breeding pair. Researcher Jilian Fazio is looking at stress
   and reproductive hormones to determine if different introduction
   techniques or individual personalities spell success or failure when it
   comes to fishing cat reproduction. The National Zoo's recent success is
   particularly important for fishing cat populations in human care. Of
   the 32 fishing cats in the North America SSP, only 27 of them are
   considered reproductively viable. Lek and Electra's kittens will become
   valuable breeders because their genes are not well represented in the
   captive population.

   Only one other facility accredited by the AZA has successfully bred
   fishing cats since 2009. The Zoo hopes that by sharing its successful
   management strategies, other zoos across the country will have similar
   results.

   National Zoo veterinarians will perform a complete physical exam on the
   fishing cat kittens and administer the first set of vaccines in the
   next few weeks. However, keepers have observed the kittens growing and
   becoming more independent every day.

   "Electra will let the kittens explore only so far before she brings
   them back under her close watch," said Animal Keeper Courtney Janney.
   "Her maternal instincts kicked in right away, and sheâs proving to be a
   very adept and confident mother. We are very proud of the whole process
   and look forward to learning all we can about their development."

   Fishing cats are vanishing from riverbanks in their native India and
   Southeast Asia due to water pollution, poaching and increased shrimp
   farming throughout their habitat. Wild populations have decreased by 50
   percent in the past 18 years, prompting the [105]International Union
   for Conservation of Nature to change the speciesâ status from
   vulnerable to endangered.

   Fishing cats are named after their hunting technique. The majority of
   their diet consists of prey such as fish, frogs and aquatic birds, and
   they have a unique way of capturing their meals. By tapping their paws
   on the surface of the water, they trick prey into thinking the water
   ripples are from an insect. When the prey is close enough, the cat will
   either dive into the water after it or scoop it out using its partially
   webbed paw.
