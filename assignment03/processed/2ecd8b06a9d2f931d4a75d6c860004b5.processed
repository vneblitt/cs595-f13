   President Barack Obama on Thursday visited the site of the historic
   1848 women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y., leaving behind a
   copy of the first bill he signed in office, theÂ Lilly Ledbetter Fair
   Pay Act.

   Obama's visit, ahead of Women's Equality Day next week, came during his
   bus tour through upstate New York and Pennsylvania promoting his
   college affordability proposals.Â Obama also left a copy of his remarks
   during the 2009 bill signing.

   The law made it easier for women to file equal-pay lawsuits by
   establishing that the 180-day statute of limitations on filing claims
   of discriminatory wage practices resets with every paycheck.

   "It's an honor to visit Seneca Falls and recall the righteous struggle
   that found expression here," Obama said at the Womenâs Rights National
   Historical Park. "I'm also proud to add an example of Lilly Ledbetter's
   leadership to your collection. Thanks for all you do to honor the
   character and perseverance of America's women."

   Obama made brief remarks about the law and its goals, before posing for
   pictures with those in attendance.

   "We want to make a little contribution," Obama said in leaving behind a
   copy of the bill.

   "Please! We'll take it," one woman remarked.

   Obama purchased severalÂ souvenirs for his daughters, the White House
   said, including copies of the Declaration of Sentiments that was signed
   at the Women's Rights Convention.

   There was no equality day when women gained the right to vote in 1920.
   That's because women were not given the responsibility for defending
   the country.

   In the years leading up to suffrage, while women were demanding the
   right to vote, World War One by the tens of thousands was killing and
   maiming young men, many of whom themselves were too young to vote but
   not too young to be conscripted. Demanding the right to live never
   occurred to them in that era. What if women back then had been told
   that getting the vote would mean being required to fight in a war in a
   strange land far away from the comfort of home and family? How many
   women would have said, "Take this suffrage and stuff it"?

   Having the vote is looked at as giving women more power relative to
   men. But consider:Â

   In 1912, a few years before suffrage, 18-year-old boys, who had their
   entire adult lives ahead of them, were among the men barred from
   entering the Titanic's life boats before females, many of whom were old
   enough to have already lived three or four times longer than these
   boys.Â

   The custom of âwomen and children firstâ ran not only against the
   interests of men but also against the interests of children: 74 percent
   of the Titanicâs women were saved, compared to only 52 percent of the
   children. (See the Anesi Web Site at
   [94]http://www.anesi.com/titanic.htm.)Â

   For every adult female saved on the Titanic, two more children might
   have been saved. When our most important right was at stake â the right
   to live â womenâs interest trumped even the interests of children.Â

   What incredible power: to live a long life, then to be rescued in a
   crisis at the expense of both men AND children. That's the power
   experienced by the older women helped into Titanicâs lifeboats. (If old
   men had been saved at the expense of women and children, weâd still be
   hearing about it as an example of the oppression of women and the
   privilege of men.)

   That was at the pinnacle of the "oppressive patriarchy." Oppressive to
   whom?

   Advocates of "Equality Day" seem to have no idea of what real equality
   is. That's because they're blinded by the apex fallacy:

   "The apex fallacy is the idea that we use the most visible members of a
   group to make generalizations about the entire group; i.e. we see
   prominent men at the top of the pyramid and think all men are doing
   well, when, in fact, there are a great many at the bottom of the
   pyramid too." -Alison Beard, a senior editor at Harvard Business

   Women's groups, like all politically organizations, seek only
   advantage. Equality has nothing to do with it.

   Equal pay for equal work. What a novel idea.
