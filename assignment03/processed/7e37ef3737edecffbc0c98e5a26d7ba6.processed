[25]The Abortion Fight Unfolding In Iowa That Could Have Huge Implications
For The Rest Of The Country

   As all eyes have been trained on high-profile battles over abortion
   access in [27]Texas and [28]North Carolina, you probably haven't heard
   much about Iowa lately. Health officials in the Hawkeye State have been
   quietly moving forward with an anti-choice initiative that's largely
   flown under the radar. Iowa's Board of Medicine is [29]proposing rules
   that would ban so-called "telemedicine abortion" -- an initiative that
   would ultimately threaten reproductive health care for the state's
   low-income and rural communities, and could also spark a legal fight
   with implications for abortion access across the country.

   What's "telemedicine abortion"? Why are we fighting over this? What
   does this mean for the broader reproductive rights landscape? Here's
   what you need to know:

   "Telemedicine" is becoming a standard health practice. "Telemedicine"
   is a fancy term for the practice of using video technology to allow
   doctors to consult with patients remotely. Telemedicine procedures,
   which were first invented in the 1960s to treat astronauts, are
   becoming an increasingly standard practice in the medical community.
   Telemedicine is now used by about 10 million to 12 million Americans
   every year, and the federal government has [30]adopted the practice to
   treat chronically ill veterans. In 2008, Planned Parenthood of the
   Heartland [31]began using telemedicine to expand disadvantaged women's
   access to abortion. Iowa was the first state to pioneer a telemedicine
   abortion program, hoping to help women in rural areas who don't live
   near an abortion clinic and can't afford to travel to the closest one.

   Telemedicine abortions are very safe. The anti-choice community tends
   to decry telemedicine reproductive care as "[32]webcam abortions,"
   drumming up fear about robot doctors operating on women. In fact, the
   procedure simply involves a doctor prescribing a pill over a video
   chat. Telemedicine abortion is only available for women who are having
   first-trimester, non-surgical, medicine-induced abortions. Several
   studies have confirmed that women [33]feel satisfied with these
   procedures, and it makes no difference to them whether they're speaking
   with a doctor in person or over the phone. Research has also shown that
   it's [34]very safe -- which makes sense, because first-trimester
   abortions are [35]incredibly safe.

   Abortion opponents see telemedicine as yet another avenue to cut off
   access to abortion. Telemedicine abortion programs are not actually
   very common yet. (Planned Parenthood of the Heartland runs the largest
   one in Iowa, and there have been fledgling initiatives in Nebraska,
   Minnesota, and Texas.) But abortion opponents are preemptively
   attacking it anyway, hoping to cut off the possibility of expanding
   reproductive access to more women. Over the past several years, twelve
   states have [36]rushed to enact bans on telemedical abortion services
   even if they're not currently in place. Now, state laws often stipulate
   that women must be in the presence of a doctor when taking the abortion
   pill -- even though that's medically unnecessary -- preventing
   telemedicine programs [37]from even getting off the ground. Other
   states try to [38]limit access to the abortion pill by forcing clinics
   to adhere to outdated methods of administering it.

   Iowa's Board of Medicine reviewed and approved the telemedicine program
   in 2010 -- but since then, the Board has been stacked with abortion
   opponents. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, an ardent anti-choice Republican,
   has [39]replaced all ten members of the Board since the last review of
   the telemedicine abortion program. Now, it's filled with abortion
   opponents, including a Catholic priest. In June, those new members of
   the board voted to approve rules that would ban Iowa's telemedicine
   services for abortion care. And this week, a legislative committee
   [40]agreed to let the Board continue with implementing those rules.
   "This is a terrifying example of politics dictating health care," Dr.
   Robert Shaw, the chairman of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland's
   board of directors, [41]said on Wednesday.

   The nation's biggest telemedicine program could be banned as early as
   October. The Board of Medicine will [42]hold a public hearing about the
   matter at the end of this month. After that, the Board will review the
   proposed rule again -- and, given the overwhelming support for it among
   the new board members, it will likely go ahead and approve it. The
   telemedicine ban could take effect this fall.

   As states move to shut down abortion clinics, access to telemedicine is
   more important than ever. Around the country, state legislators are
   launching a coordinated attack on abortion clinics -- a somewhat
   indirect method of limiting abortion access without banning the
   procedure altogether. The recent high-profile fight in Texas culminated
   in the GOP-led legislature approving [43]sweeping new restrictions that
   will likely force 90 percent of the state's clinics to close. As
   low-income women lose access to nearby clinics and may be forced to
   travel [44]hundreds of miles to get to the nearest one -- an expensive
   trip that many of them [45]cannot afford -- the ability to consult with
   a doctor remotely could significantly improve their ability to get the
   care they need. As [46]the American Prospect points out, there are
   other legal challenges brewing about telemedicine in other states, too.
   If these programs are banned, and if courts allow those bans to stand,
   it could have implications far outside of Iowa. It could signal that
   this particular avenue is totally cut off to reproductive health
   advocates, and [47]low-income and rural women will pay the price.
