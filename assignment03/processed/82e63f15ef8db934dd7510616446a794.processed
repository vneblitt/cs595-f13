   Published on Mar 9, 2012

   Our bodies repair and regenerate with the help of compound structures
   at the end of chromosomes called telomeres. But as these telomeres
   weaken, we age. Harvard swimmer Meaghan Leddy COL '12 explains how
   Harvard scientists are exploring ways to reverse the symptoms of aging
   by increasing the levels of a certain enzyme to keep our telomeres
   healthy. It's a program with eternal benefits.
