Przewalski's Horse Foal

First Wild Horse Born from Artificial Insemination at Smithsonian
Conservation Biology Institute

August 25, 2013

   How is this work different from work done in domestic horses?

   The domestic horse has been studied systematically for decades leading
   to routine use of assisted reproductive technologies such as artificial
   insemination, sperm cryopreservation, and embryo transfers. Despite
   these advances, little effort has been invested in the study of wild
   equids.

   Recently, we reported the successful birth of two foals in the Persian
   onager via artificial insemination. This was a landmark event since no
   other wild equid has been born via artificial insemination. Although it
   is reasonable to assume that the reproductive systems of domestic mares
   would be similar to that of Przewalski's mares, our past experiences
   suggest otherwise. We needed to understand the basic reproductive
   biology of the Przewalski's horse.

   Przewalski's horses have kept retained all of their wild instincts and
   can be challenging to work with them. To date, no one has successfully
   put a halter on a Przewalski's horse. Unlike with domestic mares, we
   cannot command the animals to cooperate with researchers and managers.

   Our work is more about the basics than the intricate work being done
   with domestic horses. We are interested in taking the techniques and
   practices developed for domestic horses and applying them to this
   endangered species. One example of this is the utilization of
   artificial insemination. A technique regularly used with domestic
   horses--the successful application of artificial insemination in
   Przewalski's horse--would open up many new opportunities for genetic
   management. These advances in the Przewalski's horse also would enable
   the safe and efficient transportation of frozen sperm instead of live
   animals for breeding purposes. We are constantly striving for the
   betterment and preservation of this endangered species in captivity.

   Anne's filly is doing wonderfully. She cut her first tooth last week!

   A second Przewalski's horse foal was born on August 15 to a mare named
   Solongo (which means "rainbow" in Mongolian). The foal is a little colt
   born not from artificial insemination but from natural breeding. A
   Stallion named Frog is the colt's father. Frog is also the grandfather
   of the AI filly (he is Anne's dad). Frog is the most genetically
   valuable Przewalski's horse in North America.

   As the little filly is now more than three weeks old, she was really
   wanting someone to play with. In the wild, foals are born relatively
   close together in the spring and summer.

   Animal care staff introduced on August 20, and everyone seems to get
   along, though they haven't interacted much yet. The moms are keeping
   the youngsters close at their sides so far. It may take a few days for
   them to get acquainted.

   Why work with wild equids? What is special about Przewalski's Horse?

   When they hear the word "horse" most people have a distinct mental
   image of the domestic horse (Equus ferus caballus) we loved as
   children--who didn't want a pony as a kid? The domestic horse has
   become a multi-million dollar industry to some and serves as companion
   animals to others. We have a vast and intimate understanding of them,
   from nutrition to reproduction, exercise physiology to social structure
   and herd dynamics.

   However, the domestic horse is not the only equine species in
   existence. Seven equid species survive today in various regions of the
   world, but most people only recognize the zebra (there are three
   species of zebra alone). Few are familiar with other equids including
   the Persian onager or Somali wild ass or the Khulan. In contrast, the
   Przewalski's horse is considered the last wild horse although it is
   often mistaken for a breed of domestic horse, the Norwegian Fjord.

   Despite our extensive knowledge about domestic horses, scientists know
   relatively little about wild equids. Although we have ideas and
   comparisons we can make from our experience with E. caballus, we are
   finding that these are not entirely parallel. Given the changing
   landscapes and increasing uncertainty of wildlife habitat, we need to
   understand and uncover all that we can about wild equids to ensure
   their survival both in the wild and in captivity.

   For example, the typical social structure of the horse is a harem,
   wherein a single stallion leads a group of mares to form a herd. This
   is our traditional view of a herd of horses. However, the Khulan (Asian
   wild ass) forms fusion/fission groups, a far more loose social
   structure that comprises multiple stallions in a herd. The herd is also
   less stable group, allowing entry and exit of new animals on a regular
   basis, compared to a typical herd.

   Four of the six wild equid species are endangered or critically
   endangered, thus genetic management is also a crucial part of managing
   these species successfully in captivity. The concept of insurance
   populations managed in captivity is extremely important when
   considering the fragile future of these wild equids.

   There is hope, though. Przewalski's horses were extinct in the wild in
   1969, but animals in European zoos were bred to grow the population and
   were reintroduced in nature reserves in Mongolia in 1993. The
   Przewalski's horse also was recently re-classified from critically
   endangered to endangered. They are one of the success stories of an
   endangered species. After their extinction in the wild, there were only
   14 breeding adults-the entire population is therefore descendants of
   these 14 animals.

   The Przewalski's horse can breed and give birth to fertile offspring
   with domestic horses. This is peculiar due to the differing number of
   chromosomes: domestics have 64 while Przewalski's have 66 and the
   hybrid (65 chromosomes) remain fertile unlike the horse and donkey
   hybrids. As with many of the wild equids, they share many similarities
   to the domestic horse, but significant differences as well.

   Ultimately, the goal of equid research at SCBI is to better understand
   the fundamental biology of rare and endangered equids and to use this
   new information to establish self-sustaining populations both in
   captivity and in the wild.

   Scientists at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute are
   celebrating the birth of a female Przewalski's (Cha-VAL-skee)
   horse--the first to be born via artificial insemination. The foal's
   birth on July 27 signals a huge breakthrough for the survival of this
   species. SCBI reproductive physiologist Budhan Pukazhenthi and the
   Przewalski's horse husbandry team spent seven years working closely
   with experts at The Wilds and Auburn University in Alabama to perfect
   the technique of assisted breeding. Both the filly and the first-time
   mother Anne are in good health and bonding.

   "It seems reasonable to assume that reproduction for the Przewalski's
   horse would be similar to domestic horses, but it simply isn't the
   case," said Pukazhenthi. "After all these years of persevering, I can
   honestly say I was elated to receive the call informing me that the
   foal had been born. I couldn't wait to see her! This is a major
   accomplishment, and we hope our success will stimulate more interest in
   studying and conserving endangered equids around the world."

   Anne was born at SCBI and is the daughter of a mare imported from
   Europe and the most genetically valuable stallion in the U.S. The
   filly's father Agi also lives at SCBI. The Przewalski's horse is
   considered the last wild horse on the planet, although it is often
   mistaken for a breed of domestic horse, the Norwegian Fjord. Little is
   known about wild equids despite the extensive knowledge of domestic
   horses, Equus caballus.

   The usefulness of artificial insemination is that it does not require
   both animals to be together for a successful mating.The transport of
   animals to different locations can be difficult, dangerous, costly and
   potentially stressful to the individual. By contrast, the collection of
   semen can be safely accomplished under the supervision of veterinary
   staff and significantly improves the efficiency of managing small
   populations of endangered species. The birth of Anne and Agi's filly
   required hormonal treatments for inducing ovulation in a mare,
   specialized animal-handling facilities, conditioning Anne to provide
   urine samples for hormone monitoring and routine ultrasounds. This
   accomplishment validates the importance of integrating animal
   management in the research and development of assisted reproductive
   technologies for endangered species.

   Using ultrasound technology, Pukazhenthi confirmed the pregnancy about
   35 days after the insemination. The mare's pregnancy was monitored
   closely for 11 months measuring urinary hormone levels and visual keys
   (such as her growing belly).

   "Anne is a young, first-time mother," said Dolores Reed, supervisory
   biologist at SCBI. "She had a normal pregnancy that lasted 340 days and
   the foaling lasted less than 10 minutes. I've raised a lot of foals and
   other hoofed stock over the years, but this filly feels like an
   extra-special triumph for us and her species."

   This work is part of SCBI, The Wilds's and Auburn
   University'scollaboration with the Conservation Centers for Species
   Survival, a group of large conservation facilities in North America
   dedicated to cooperative breeding and research for the advancement of
   species conservation. Established in 2005, C2S2 applies its unique
   resources for the survival of species with special needs, especially
   those requiring large living areas, natural group sizes, minimal public
   disturbance and scientific research. SCBI and The Wilds are members of
   C2S2, along with Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, White Oak Conservation,
   San Diego Zoo Global and Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo.

   In 2008, veterinarians at the Zoo, in cooperation with a human
   fertility expert from St. Louis, performed the first successful
   vasectomy reversal on a Przewalski's horse. This was the first
   procedure of its kind to be performed on an endangered equid species.
   SCBI scientists were also the first to produce two Persian onager foals
   via artificial insemination, a landmark event since no other wild equid
   had been produced via artificial insemination to date.

   The Przewalski's horse is a species native to China and Mongolia that
   was declared extinct in the wild in 1969. Today, approximately 1,500
   Przewalski's horses reside at zoological institutions worldwide,
   carrying genes from only 14 original animals. Due to hunting, harsh
   climate, loss of habitat and loss of water sources, fewer than 500 of
   this species are left in the wild. Currently, most live in Mongolia,
   China and Kazakhstan. SCBI scientists are working in remote areas of
   China using radio collars and Geographic Information System technology
   to map the movements of these horses, which were reintroduced by
   Chinese colleagues into their former habitat. Committed to preserving
   this species and equid research in general, SCBI works to maintain
   breeding populations that serve as a source of animals for
   reintroduction.
