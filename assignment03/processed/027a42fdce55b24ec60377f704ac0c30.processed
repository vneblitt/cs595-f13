   The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires each of the nationwide
   credit reporting companies -- Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion -- to
   provide you with a free copy of your credit report, at your request,
   once every 12 months. The FCRA promotes the accuracy and privacy of
   information in the files of the nation's credit reporting companies.
   The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's consumer protection
   agency, enforces the FCRA with respect to credit reporting companies.

   A credit report includes information on where you live, how you pay
   your bills, and whether you've been sued or have filed for bankruptcy.
   Nationwide credit reporting companies sell the information in your
   report to creditors, insurers, employers, and other businesses that use
   it to evaluate your applications for credit, insurance, employment, or
   renting a home.

   Here are the details about your rights under the FCRA, which
   established the free annual credit report program.

Q: How do I order my free report?

   The three nationwide credit reporting companies have set up a central
   website, a toll-free telephone number, and a mailing address through
   which you can order your free annual report.

   To order, visit [22]annualcreditreport.com, call 1-877-322-8228. Or
   complete the [23]Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to:
   Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA
   30348-5281. Do not contact the three nationwide credit reporting
   companies individually. They are providing free annual credit reports
   only through [24]annualcreditreport.com, 1-877-322-8228 or mailing to
   Annual Credit Report Request Service.

   You may order your reports from each of the three nationwide credit
   reporting companies at the same time, or you can order your report from
   each of the companies one at a time. The law allows you to order one
   free copy of your report from each of the nationwide credit reporting
   companies every 12 months.

A Warning About "Imposter" Websites

   Only one website is authorized to fill orders for the free annual
   credit report you are entitled to under law -- annualcreditreport.com.
   Other websites that claim to offer "free credit reports," "free credit
   scores," or "free credit monitoring" are not part of the legally
   mandated free annual credit report program. In some cases, the "free"
   product comes with strings attached. For example, some sites sign you
   up for a supposedly "free" service that converts to one you have to pay
   for after a trial period. If you don't cancel during the trial period,
   you may be unwittingly agreeing to let the company start charging fees
   to your credit card.

   Some "imposter" sites use terms like "free report" in their names;
   others have URLs that purposely misspell annualcreditreport.com in the
   hope that you will mistype the name of the official site. Some of these
   "imposter" sites direct you to other sites that try to sell you
   something or collect your personal information.

   Annualcreditreport.com and the nationwide credit reporting companies
   will not send you an email asking for your personal information. If you
   get an email, see a pop-up ad, or get a phone call from someone
   claiming to be from annualcreditreport.com or any of the three
   nationwide credit reporting companies, do not reply or click on any
   link in the message. It's probably a scam. Forward any such email to
   the FTC at [25]spam@uce.gov.

Q: What information do I need to provide to get my free report?

   A: You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and
   date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to
   provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file,
   each nationwide credit reporting company may ask you for some
   information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly
   mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information
   because the information each has in your file may come from different
   sources.

Q: Why do I want a copy of my credit report?

   A: Your credit report has information that affects whether you can get
   a loan -- and how much you will have to pay to borrow money. You want a
   copy of your credit report to:
     * make sure the information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date
       before you apply for a loan for a major purchase like a house or
       car, buy insurance, or apply for a job.
     * help [26]guard against identity theft. That's when someone uses
       your personal information -- like your name, your Social Security
       number, or your credit card number -- to commit fraud. Identity
       thieves may use your information to open a new credit card account
       in your name. Then, when they don't pay the bills, the delinquent
       account is reported on your credit report. Inaccurate information
       like that could affect your ability to get credit, insurance, or
       even a job.

Q: How long does it take to get my report after I order it?

   A: If you request your report online at annualcreditreport.com, you
   should be able to access it immediately. If you order your report by
   calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, your report will be processed and
   mailed to you within 15 days. If you order your report by mail using
   the Annual Credit Report Request Form, your request will be processed
   and mailed to you within 15 days of receipt.

   Whether you order your report online, by phone, or by mail, it may take
   longer to receive your report if the nationwide credit reporting
   company needs more information to verify your identity.

Q: Are there any other situations where I might be eligible for a free
report?

   A: Under federal law, you're entitled to a free report if a company
   takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for
   credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60
   days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the
   name, address, and phone number of the credit reporting company. You're
   also entitled to one free report a year if you're unemployed and plan
   to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your
   report is inaccurate because of fraud, including identity theft.
   Otherwise, a credit reporting company may charge you a reasonable
   amount for another copy of your report within a 12-month period.

   To buy a copy of your report, contact:
     * Equifax:1-800-685-1111; [27]equifax.com
     * Experian: 1-888-397-3742; [28]experian.com
     * TransUnion: 1-800-916-8800; [29]transunion.com

Q: Should I order a report from each of the three nationwide credit reporting
companies?

   A: It's up to you. Because nationwide credit reporting companies get
   their information from different sources, the information in your
   report from one company may not reflect all, or the same, information
   in your reports from the other two companies. That's not to say that
   the information in any of your reports is necessarily inaccurate; it
   just may be different.

Q: Should I order my reports from all three of the nationwide credit
reporting companies at the same time?

   A: You may order one, two, or all three reports at the same time, or
   you may stagger your requests. It's your choice. Some financial
   advisors say staggering your requests during a 12-month period may be a
   good way to keep an eye on the accuracy and completeness of the
   information in your reports.

Q: What if I find errors -- either inaccuracies or incomplete information --
in my credit report?

   A: Under the FCRA, both the credit reporting company and the
   information provider (that is, the person, company, or organization
   that provides information about you to a consumer reporting company)
   are responsible for [30]correcting inaccurate or incomplete information
   in your report. To take full advantage of your rights under this law,
   contact the credit reporting company and the information provider.

   1. Tell the credit reporting company, in writing, what information you
   think is inaccurate.

   Credit reporting companies must investigate the items in question --
   usually within 30 days -- unless they consider your dispute frivolous.
   They also must forward all the relevant data you provide about the
   inaccuracy to the organization that provided the information. After the
   information provider receives notice of a dispute from the credit
   reporting company, it must investigate, review the relevant
   information, and report the results back to the credit reporting
   company. If the information provider finds the disputed information is
   inaccurate, it must notify all three nationwide credit reporting
   companies so they can correct the information in your file.

   When the investigation is complete, the credit reporting company must
   give you the written results and a free copy of your report if the
   dispute results in a change. (This free report does not count as your
   annual free report.) If an item is changed or deleted, the credit
   reporting company cannot put the disputed information back in your file
   unless the information provider verifies that it is accurate and
   complete. The credit reporting company also must send you written
   notice that includes the name, address, and phone number of the
   information provider.

   2. Tell the creditor or other information provider in writing that you
   dispute an item. Many providers specify an address for disputes. If the
   provider reports the item to a credit reporting company, it must
   include a notice of your dispute. And if you are correct -- that is, if
   the information is found to be inaccurate -- the information provider
   may not report it again.

   Q: What can I do if the credit reporting company or information
   provider won't correct the information I dispute?

   A: If an investigation doesn't resolve your dispute with the credit
   reporting company, you can ask that a statement of the dispute be
   included in your file and in future reports. You also can ask the
   credit reporting company to provide your statement to anyone who
   received a copy of your report in the recent past. You can expect to
   pay a fee for this service.

   If you tell the information provider that you dispute an item, a notice
   of your dispute must be included any time the information provider
   reports the item to a credit reporting company.

Q: How long can a credit reporting company report negative information?

   A: A credit reporting company can report most accurate negative
   information for seven years and bankruptcy information for 10 years.
   There is no time limit on reporting information about criminal
   convictions; information reported in response to your application for a
   job that pays more than $75,000 a year; and information reported
   because you've applied for more than $150,000 worth of credit or life
   insurance. Information about a lawsuit or an unpaid judgment against
   you can be reported for seven years or until the statute of limitations
   runs out, whichever is longer.

Q: Can anyone else get a copy of my credit report?

   A: The FCRA specifies who can access your credit report. Creditors,
   insurers, employers, and other businesses that use the information in
   your report to evaluate your applications for credit, insurance,
   employment, or renting a home are among those that have a legal right
   to access your report.

Q: Can my employer get my credit report?

   A: Your [31]employer can get a copy of your credit report only if you
   agree. A credit reporting company may not provide information about you
   to your employer, or to a prospective employer, without your written
   consent.
