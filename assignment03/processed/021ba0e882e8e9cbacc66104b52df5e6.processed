'Project X' Actor Nick Nervies -- ARRESTED ... For Domestic Violence

   [29]Celebrity Justice
   9/15/2013 7:51 AM PDT [30]BY TMZ STAFF
   'Project X' Actor
   ARRESTED
   ... For Domestic Violence
   Exclusive
   0915_nick-nervies_getty
   One of the tough kid security guards from "Project X" was arrested
   yesterday after allegedly getting physical with his girlfriend ... TMZ
   has learned.
   Law enforcement sources tell TMZ -- deputies received a call from
   someone around 4:30 pm claiming 'X' star Nick Nervies had been arguing
   with his girlfriend and it escalated in a bad way.
   It's unclear what happened but when cops arrived the alleged victim had
   minor injuries -- not serious enough for an ambulance.
   The 18-year old actor was cuffed and taken to a nearby jail where he
   was booked on misdemeanor domestic violence charges.

   everything these days is domestic violence. if you wife or GF is angry
   with you for any reason, that's proof enough for the police, and
   they'll arrest you.

   gents, NEVER live with a woman. the end of your freedom is just a 3
   digit call away, anytime she chooses to get mad at you.
