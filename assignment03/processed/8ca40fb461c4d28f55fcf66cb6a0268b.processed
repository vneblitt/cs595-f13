Virginia Tech's sycamore is still standing by way of its clone, and the DNA
is in it

   clones of the Henderson Lawn sycamore. This tree was planted outside
   Cheatham Hall in May 2011; the remaining clone will be planted on
   Henderson Lawn on April 22, 2013.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., April 17, 2013 - Thanks to the efforts of two forestry
   professors, Virginia Tech's sycamore tree will once again grace
   Henderson Lawn, which borders the [160]town of Blacksburg, this time by
   way of its progeny with the same DNA.

   On Monday, April 22, at 11:30 a.m., Virginia Tech President Charles W.
   Steger will preside over a town-gown tree planting celebration with
   Blacksburg Mayor Ron Rordam on Henderson Lawn near where the original
   sycamore once stood. The 10-foot tree to be planted was rooted from a
   cutting taken shortly before the dying historic tree was removed for
   safety reasons in the summer of 2010.

   The celebration, in honor of Earth Day on April 22 and Arbor Day on
   April 26, is open to the campus, the citizens of Blacksburg, and the
   public at large, and will go on rain or shine near the corner of
   Blacksburg's College Avenue and North Main Street, across from the
   Lyric Theater.

   "The cloning and replanting of the sycamore is a historic milestone in
   so many ways," said Rordam. "The strong roots of this tree are a symbol
   for the strength and perseverance of our community and a true
   demonstration of how the town and the university can grow together."

   "For years to come, our citizens will be able to stroll along the
   College Avenue Promenade to Henderson Lawn and create their own
   memories underneath this great connection to the past," he continued.

   The stately old sycamore, which dated to around 1870, not only tied the
   town of Blacksburg and Virginia Tech together but was a source of
   personal connection for many. It served as a site to meet, to sit and
   relax, and, on a number of occasions, even to propose marriage.
   Generations of alumni and townspeople have countless memories of the
   legacy tree that stood so prominently for well over a hundred years.

   The sycamore clone being planted is one of only two that miraculously
   survived from 300 small cuttings taken from the mother tree.
   "Unfortunately, we just were not very good at getting the cuttings to
   root," explained [161]John Seiler, Alumni Distinguished Professor and
   the Honorable and Mrs. Shelton H. Short Jr. Professor of Forestry in
   the [162]College of Natural Resources and Environment.

   "It was likely the wrong time of year, but we had to try since the
   tree's removal was imminent," he continued. "The only other cutting
   that survived was planted last May outside the College of Natural
   Resources and Environment building, which has a tradition of planting a
   tree honoring each graduating class."

   In a casual conversation with fellow members of the university's
   Arboretum Committee in 2010, Seiler lamented the fact that the historic
   sycamore had to be removed. The idea occurred to them that perhaps they
   could try cloning the tree. And so they did.

   Seiler grew the tree in a campus greenhouse, and then [163]Eric
   Wiseman, associate professor of urban forestry and arboriculture in the
   College of Natural Resources and Environment, took over and planted it
   at the campus [164]Urban Horticulture Center operated by the
   [165]College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.

   "Over time this identical twin will look just like its mother tree,
   which succumbed to what became a poor growing environment, root damage
   from underground utility work in the 1980s, fungal disease, and old
   age," Wiseman explained.

   "The Town of Blacksburg and Virginia Tech have worked closely on the
   design of the College Avenue project that converts the street into a
   pedestrian-friendly promenade," said Matthew Gart, landscape architect
   for the Office of University Planning. "When we found out about the
   successful cloning of the tree, we immediately spoke to the town and
   its project designer about placing the tree within the Henderson Lawn
   landscape design. It's been a great cooperative effort to make this
   happen."

   Because Earth Day, sustainability, and planting trees are
   inter-related, town-gown officials thought that planting the sycamore
   clone was an ideal way to recognize the 43rd anniversary of Earth Day
   on April 22. "This event also marks a special day for Virginia Tech
   because on April 22, 2009, our University Council voted to recommend
   that the board of visitors approve the campus Climate Action Commitment
   Resolution and accompanying Sustainability Plan, which the board later
   did," said Denny Cochrane, Virginia Tech's sustainability program
   manager.

   "Virginia Tech was awarded Tree Campus USA status by the National Arbor
   Day Foundation in 2008, the inaugural year of the program, and we have
   received annual re-certification ever since," Cochrane noted. "Tree
   planting directly supports the goals of our sustainability program,
   adds to the beautification of our campus landscape, and is a major
   component of our student-led Earth Week program each year."

   "A world without trees would be a vastly different place," added Paul
   Winistorfer, dean of the College of Natural Resources and Environment.
   "Trees hold enormous emotional attachments for people of all ages. They
   are not just valued for their utility."

   "Here in the Appalachian Mountains, we enjoy an incredible diversity of
   850 species," Winistorfer continued, "so this event marks a significant
   occasion to perpetuate the memory of a tree that was very special to
   many people over the ages."

   Dedicated to its motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), [166]Virginia
   Tech takes a hands-on, engaging approach to education, preparing
   scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the
   commonwealth's most comprehensive university and its leading research
   institution, Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree
   programs to more than 30,000 students and manages a research portfolio
   of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of
   transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and
   by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and
   across Virginia.
