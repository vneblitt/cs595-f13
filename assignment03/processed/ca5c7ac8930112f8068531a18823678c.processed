   This indicator describes trends in average temperature for the United
   States and the world.
   Combined bar and line graph showing changes in average temperatures for
   the contiguous 48 states from 1901 to 2012.

   Web update: August 2013

   This figure shows how annual average temperatures in the contiguous 48
   states have changed since 1901. Surface data come from land-based
   weather stations. Satellite measurements cover the lower troposphere,
   which is the lowest level of the Earth's atmosphere. "UAH" and "RSS"
   represent two different methods of analyzing the original satellite
   measurements. This graph uses the 1901 to 2000 average as a baseline
   for depicting change. Choosing a different baseline period would not
   change the shape of the data over time.

Key Points

     * Since 1901, the average surface temperature across the contiguous
       48 states has risen at an average rate of 0.14Â°F per decade
       (1.4Â°F per century) (see Figure 1). Average temperatures have
       risen more quickly since the late 1970s (0.36 to 0.55Â°F per
       decade). Seven of the top 10 warmest years on record for the
       contiguous 48 states have occurred since 1998, and 2012 was the
       warmest year on record.
     * Worldwide, 2001-2010 was the warmest decade on record since
       thermometer-based observations began. Global average surface
       temperature has risen at an average rate of 0.15Â°F per decade
       since 1901 (see Figure 2), similar to the rate of warming within
       the contiguous 48 states. Since the late 1970s, however, the United
       States has warmed faster than the global rate.
     * Some parts of the United States have experienced more warming than
       others (see Figure 3). The North, the West, and Alaska have seen
       temperatures increase the most, while some parts of the Southeast
       have experienced little change. However, not all of these regional
       trends are statistically significant.

Background

   Temperature is a fundamental measurement for describing the climate,
   and the temperature in particular places can have wide-ranging effects
   on human life and ecosystems. For example, increases in air temperature
   can lead to more intense heat waves, which can cause illness and death,
   especially in vulnerable populations. Annual and seasonal temperature
   patterns also determine the types of animals and plants that can
   survive in particular locations. Changes in temperature can disrupt a
   wide range of natural processes, particularly if these changes occur
   more quickly than plant and animal species can adapt.

   Concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are increasing in the
   Earth's atmosphere (see the [71]Atmospheric Concentrations of
   Greenhouse Gases indicator). In response, average temperatures at the
   Earth's surface are rising and are expected to continue rising.
   However, because climate change can shift the wind patterns and ocean
   currents that drive the world's climate system, some areas experience
   more warming than others, and some might experience cooling.

About the Indicator

   This indicator examines U.S. and global surface temperature patterns
   from 1901 to the present. U.S. surface measurements come from weather
   stations on land, while global surface measurements also incorporate
   observations from buoys and ships on the ocean, thereby providing data
   from sites spanning much of the surface of the Earth. For comparison,
   this indicator also displays satellite measurements that can be used to
   estimate the temperature of the Earth's lower atmosphere since 1979.

   This indicator shows anomalies, which compare recorded annual
   temperature values against a long-term average. For example, an anomaly
   of +2.0 degrees means the average temperature was 2 degrees higher than
   the long-term average. This indicator uses the average temperature from
   1901 to 2000 as a baseline for comparison. Annual anomalies are
   calculated for each weather station, starting from daily and monthly
   average temperatures. Anomalies for broader regions have been
   determined by dividing the country (or the world) into a grid,
   averaging the data for all weather stations within each cell of the
   grid, and then averaging the grid cells together (for Figures 1 and 2)
   or displaying them on a map (Figure 3). This method ensures that the
   results are not biased toward regions that happen to have many stations
   close together.

Indicator Notes

   Data from the early 20^th century are somewhat less precise than more
   recent data because there were fewer stations collecting measurements
   at the time, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. However, the
   overall trends are still reliable. Where possible, the data have been
   adjusted to account for any biases that might be introduced by station
   moves, development (e.g., urbanization) near the station, changes in
   instruments and times of measurement, and other changes.

Data Sources

   The data for this indicator were provided by the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center, which
   maintains a large collection of climate data online at:
   [72]www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/
   ncdc.html. Surface temperature anomalies were calculated based on
   monthly values from a network of long-term monitoring stations.
   Satellite data were analyzed by two independent groupsâthe Global
   Hydrology and Climate Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville
   (UAH) and Remote Sensing Systems (RSS)âresulting in slightly different
   trend lines.
