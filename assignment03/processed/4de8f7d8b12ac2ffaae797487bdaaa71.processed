19th Century British Expeditions in Africa and Australia Are Subject of Book
Discussion

Explorers Viewed These Continents as ‚Blank Spaces‚

   At the beginning of the 19th century, the British Empire that
   encompassed the interiors of Africa and Australia remained a mystery.
   Determined explorers met the challenge of opening these continents to
   imperial influence, as they sought knowledge, adventure and fame ‚ but
   often experienced confusion, fear and failure. "The Last Blank Spaces:
   Exploring Africa and Australia" (Harvard University Press, 2013)
   follows these explorations from idea to practice, from intention to
   outcome, from myth to reality.

   Dane Kennedy, author of "The Last Blank Spaces," will discuss and sign
   his book on Monday, Sept. 9, at noon in the Mumford Room, located on
   the sixth floor of the James Madison Memorial Building, 101
   Independence Ave. S.E., Washington, D.C. This Books & Beyond event,
   sponsored by the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress, is
   co-sponsored by the Smithsonian Libraries. It is free and open to the
   public; no tickets are required.

   Kennedy surveyed dozens of expeditions into Africa and Australia in the
   19th century, nothing that these journeys adopted a mode of scientific
   investigation that had been developed by previous generations of
   seaborne explorers. They viewed the two continents as "vast uninhabited
   oceans," empty spaces that could be made truly knowable only by
   mapping, measuring, observing and preserving. They found, however, that
   their survival and success depended less on this system of universal
   knowledge than it did on the local knowledge possessed by indigenous
   peoples.

   Dane Kennedy is the Elmer Louis Kayser professor of history and
   international affairs at George Washington University. He is also the
   author of "The Highly Civilized Man: Richard Burton and the Victorian
   World."

   Since its creation by Congress in 1977 to "stimulate public interest in
   books and reading," the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress
   ([19]www.Read.gov/cfb/) has become a major national force for reading
   and literacy promotion. A public-private partnership, it sponsors
   educational programs that reach readers of all ages, nationally and
   internationally. The center provides leadership for affiliated state
   centers for the book (including the District of Columbia and the U.S.
   Virgin Islands) and nonprofit reading-promotion partners and plays a
   key role in the Library‚s annual National Book Festival. It also
   oversees the Library‚s [20]www.Read.gov website and administers the
   Library‚s [21]Young Readers Center and the [22]Poetry and Literature
   Center.

   The Smithsonian Libraries maintain a collection of more than 2 million
   volumes and serve as an educational resource for the Smithsonian
   Institution, the global research community and the public. The
   libraries are located in Washington, Edgewater, Md., New York City and
   the Republic of Panama. For more information about the Smithsonian
   Libraries, visit [23]library.si.edu (external link).

   The Library of Congress, the nation‚s oldest federal cultural
   institution and the largest library in the world, holds more than 155
   million items in various languages, disciplines and formats. The
   Library serves the U.S. Congress and the nation both on-site in its
   reading rooms on Capitol Hill and through its award-winning website at
   [24]www.loc.gov.
