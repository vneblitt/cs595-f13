Researcher finds new ways to create food, fuel

   When most people think about renewable energy and sustainable food
   sources, they imagine solar panels and wind turbines, low-impact
   agriculture and local foodsheds.

   [83]Y.H. Percival Zhang sees carbohydrates.

   Using carbohydrates, Zhang has found ways to inexpensively produce
   hydrogen to power cars and a mechanism to turn any plant into a food
   source. In carbohydrates, Zhang sees food, fresh water, biofuels,
   nutrients, and renewable materials.


   Y.H. Percival Zhang has discovered a way to extract hydrogen from
   plants in an inexpensive and environmentally friendly manner, a
   breakthrough that could help replace gasoline in cars with hydrogen
   cells. Y.H. Percival Zhang has discovered a way to extract hydrogen
   from plants in an inexpensive and environmentally friendly manner, a
   breakthrough that could help replace gasoline in cars with hydrogen
   cells.

   "What we are doing in my lab is revolutionizing the biotechnology
   paradigm to come up with solutions that could help solve some of the
   biggest challenges facing our planet," said Zhang, an associate
   professor of [84]Biological Systems Engineering in the [85]College of
   Agriculture and Life Sciences and the [86]College of Engineering. "I
   propose what I am calling the `electricity-hydrogen-carbohydrate cycle'
   to jump-start sustainability efforts around the world."

   Two of Zhang's projects involving the manipulation of carbohydrates
   have received an enormous amount of attention around the world. [87]One
   paper he published highlights how he has been able to extract large
   amounts of hydrogen from any plant, a breakthrough that has the
   potential to bring a low-cost, environmentally friendly fuel source to
   the world.

   "Our new process could help end our dependence on fossil fuels," he
   said. "Hydrogen is one of the most important biofuels of the future."

   On the surface, hydrogen fuel might not seem to have much to do with
   creating a new food source, but Zhang used an extraction process
   similar to the method he employed for hydrogen to come up with a novel
   way to manufacture one of the main components of the human diet.

   Zhang recently published a paper in the [88]Proceedings of the National
   Academy of Sciences of the United States of America that demonstrates
   how he has been able to create starch from plants not traditionally
   thought of as a food source. This would allow farmers to grow a large
   amount of biomass on marginal lands for food and biofuel without
   requiring fertilizers, pesticides, and massive amounts of water.

   All this revolutionary work involves a pot of enzymes.

   "Both of these breakthroughs are based on the use of numerous purified
   enzymes in one pot for implementing unnatural reactions," Zhang said.
   "We call it `cell-free biosystems for manufacturing' or `cell-free
   biomanufacturing.' "

   Zhang uses a variety of enzymes produced by the bacterium E. coli and
   mixes together ones not usually found together in nature.

   In the fuel project, Zhang's team liberates high-purity hydrogen under
   mild reaction conditions at 50 degrees Celsius and normal atmospheric
   pressure. The biocatalysts used to release the hydrogen are a group of
   enzymes artificially isolated from different microorganisms that thrive
   at extreme temperatures, some of which could grow at around the boiling
   point of water.

   To extract the hydrogen, the researchers manipulate xylose, a sugar
   that makes up as much as 30 percent of plant cell walls.

   To free the hydrogen, Virginia Tech bioengineers separated a number of
   enzymes from their native microorganisms to create a customized enzyme
   cocktail that does not occur in nature. The enzymes, when combined with
   xylose and a polyphosphate, liberate the unprecedentedly high volume of
   hydrogen from xylose, resulting in the production of about three times
   as much hydrogen as other hydrogen-producing microorganisms.

   Enzymes also are critical for Zhang's project with starch.

   His new approach takes cellulose from nonfood plant material, such as
   corn stover, and converts about 30 percent to amylose, a component of
   starch. Corn stover consists of the stem, leaves, and husk of the corn
   plant remaining after ears of corn are harvested. However, the process
   works with cellulose from any plant. This process has the highest sugar
   utilization efficiency. During the process, the cellulose is also
   hydrolyzed into glucose, which can used for ethanol production.

   This bioprocess is easy to scale up for commercial production. It is
   environmentally friendly because it does not require expensive
   equipment, heat, or chemical reagents and does not generate any waste.
   The key enzymes immobilized on the magnetic nanoparticles can easily be
   recycled using a magnetic force.

   His processes have a host of other potential uses, including
   biodegradable packaging, food for livestock, and a battery that runs on
   sugar.

   Now that Zhang has made two big discoveries, he's focusing on ways to
   bring them to the market, where they can start to benefit society.

   "I'd like to improve these technologies and solve the remaining
   technical issues so that we can achieve large-scale commercialization,"
   he said.

   His goal, quite simply, is to make history.

   "I want to follow in the footsteps of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, who
   transformed the world through their inventions and innovations."

       540-231-5417.

Zhang's research helps local economy

       Percival Zhang and biological systems engineering graduate Geoff
   Moxley examine wood chips, which is a biofuel raw material. Other raw
   material candidates are agricultural waste and switchgrass.

   Some of Y.H. Percival Zhang's research has already reached the
   marketplace and is making a difference in local economies.

   In 2011, OptaFuel announced that it would build a pilot plant in
   Southwest Virginia to test Zhang's research that involves extracting
   cellulose from plants and turning it into energy. OptaFuel's parent
   company, Biomethodes, licensed Zhang's technology, which brings money
   back to Virginia Tech and the commonwealth.

   The Virginia Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization
   Commission approved more than $2.5 million to build the pilot plant in
   the first year of the three-year project. Biomethodes is providing
   additional first-year funds. About $10 million more in funding is
   expected in the coming years, which Biomethodes will match. As the
   project grows, so will its economic impact on the area.

   "When you also consider the indirect jobs we will help create in
   construction, timber, and other fields, we could have a significant
   impact on the region." said OptaFuel CEO Anthony Scime.
