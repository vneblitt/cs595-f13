   Carl Kasell, the official scorekeeper for the NPR News Quiz Wait
   Wait...Don't Tell Me anchored newscast on NPR for thirty years.  The
   North Carolina native's voice can also be heard on hundreds  of
   answering machines across the country.  WCQS reporter Greta Johnsen
   spoke with Kasell recently about living in the South, waking up early
   to deliver the news on Morning Edition, and not taking life too
   seriously.
