What The March On Washington Called For, And What We Got

   Washington For Jobs and Freedom" in 1963.

   Wednesday marks the 50th celebration of the March on Washington â
   perhaps you've heard something about it? â and it's a little hard to
   resist the urge to compare the America of 1963 to 2013, to see how
   they've diverged.

   Although the "I have a dream" and the "content of their character" bits
   tend to get top billing in these remembrances, the event was called
   "The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom" â and it's worth noting
   that the word "jobs" comes before "freedom." Martin Luther King Jr.,
   the NAACP, and the march's organizers were calling for some very
   specific economic policies they thought would improve the material
   well-being of black folks in America.

   Well, according to [26]a report released by the Census Bureau ahead of
   the march's anniversary, the median income of blacks has nearly
   doubled, the poverty rate has fallen by 14 percent. Twenty-six percent
   of blacks had high school diplomas in 1964; 85 percent did in 2012. And
   over that span, the number of black folks who completed four years of
   college jumped from 4 percent to 21 percent.

   Despite those dramatic gains, the economic picture over the last 50
   years for blacks has been a mixed bag: incontrovertible, substantial
   progress â a lot of it due in part to policies the march helped
   enshrine â while some troubling disparities remain stubbornly in place.

   Here's some of what the original marchers called for, and here's what
   happened since then:

   A $2 Per Hour Minimum Wage Nationwide

   One of the tent poles of the March on Washington was an increase in the
   federal minimum wage, which [27]was $1.25 in September 1963. That would
   be equal to about $9.25 in 2013 dollars, $2 higher than the current
   federal minimum wage. The march organizers wanted a wage floor of $2 an
   hour. But $2 in 1963 would have been more than $14.80 in 2013 â more
   than double the current federal minimum wage, which hasn't been raised
   since 2009. It's pretty safe to say that that goal has gone unrealized.

   (In case you were wondering, the state of Washington's minimum wage is
   [28]the highest in the country â $9.19 â and it comes the closest to
   holding constant with the actual 1963 goal of the march's organizers.)

   A Federal Law Prohibiting Discrimination In Public Or Private Hiring

   Another major aim for the march was a law that barred discrimination in
   public and private hiring. Two years later, in 1965, the Equal
   Employment Opportunity Commission was up and running, and was granted
   the power to sue employers who discriminated against applicants or
   employees. That's a definite win for the marchers there.

   "In the 1960s, there were a number of occupations that blacks just
   couldn't get â you were categorically blocked," said [29]Algernon
   Austin, director of the Economic Policy Institute's Program on Race,
   Ethnicity and the Economy. "Now you can see blacks in almost every
   occupation â including in the White House."

   But fighting discrimination is like trying to inoculate against a
   mutating disease: The socially and legally sanctioned discrimination of
   the 1960s gave way to stealthier-but-still-dangerous forms of bias.

   "It's still the case that while there's little categorical exclusion,
   we still see evidence that employers prefer white workers," Austin
   said. He pointed to much-cited research that found that people with
   "black-sounding" names were less likely to be hired for jobs than
   people without them, even when their qualifications were about the
   same, and that a white man with a criminal record applying for a job
   was more likely to receive a response from an employer than a black man
   without one.

   The march's organizers also hoped to put a dent in the double-digit
   unemployment rate among blacks (10 percent). That figure [30]hasn't
   improved in the 50 years since, according to the Economic Policy
   Institute; indeed, the black unemployment rate over the last
   half-century â 11.6 percent â suggests that black America is operating
   in a permanent economic recession. And since 1963, the average rate of
   black unemployment has hovered at more than twice the unemployment for
   whites.

   (During the recent recession, black unemployment crept up to nearly 15
   percent.)

   Those dismal numbers might still understate just how bad the employment
   situation is. "To be counted as unemployed, you have to be actively
   looking for work," Austin said. " In communities where it's very
   difficult for people to find work, people drop out of the labor work
   because their chances are so small." In other words, there are untold
   numbers of unemployed black folks we've just ceased to count.

   This is one of the big reasons why the median household income for
   African-Americans remains so far from parity with whites, despite some
   progress. "When you're unemployed, you're only losing wealth or you're
   going into debt," Austin said.

   It's really hard to separate out the racial disparities in household
   wealth from America's housing policy. Blacks were cut off from the
   avenues to home ownership that helped create the white middle class in
   the middle of the century â they were barred from many colleges and
   buying homes in new suburbs that whites could take advantage of with
   the G.I. Bill â and so it's been a game of catch-up ever since.

   Household wealth for blacks was on an upward trend for a stretch in the
   1980s and 1990s, thanks to growing numbers of black homeowners.

   And then the housing bubble burst.

   Places like Prince George's County, Md., the wealthiest majority-black
   county in the country, were rocked by the housing crisis. Thousands of
   black people lost their homes to foreclosure.

   Black people with excellent credit were steered toward subprime loans,
   according to the [31]Center for Responsible Lending (pdf). "There's
   also evidence to suggest that housing segregation played a role,"
   Austin said. "The more segregated a community, the more [likely there
   was] to be subprime lending in the community."

   In 2011, after the havoc wrought by the crisis, the percentage of black
   people who owned homes was essentially unchanged from 1970, the
   earliest year the data was available. And three decades of black
   economic progress essentially vanished in smoke.

   Which brings us to another major peg of the march.

   Immediate Elimination Of School Segregation

   Though the Supreme Court barred segregation in schools since [32]Brown
   v. Board of Education, it was still the norm in practice eight years
   later when the March on Washington rolled around. Fifty years on, after
   white flight and busing, American schools remain deeply segregated.

   "Laws that sentenced blacks to third-class educations â those were the
   easy targets," Andrew Rotherham, a co-founder of the education think
   tank Bellwether Education Partners, [33]told The Atlantic last year. He
   said that American schools are as segregated as they were in the late
   1960s. "What's driving segregation now is housing patterns, and that's
   much more difficult to solve. It's also not necessarily a problem you
   can solve with education."

   According to [34]a report from the Civil Rights Project at the
   University of California, Los Angeles, three-quarters of all black
   students attend schools that are majority nonwhite, and more than a
   third attend schools where white students make up 10 percent or less of
   the school population.

   Maybe surprisingly, the South had become the most desegregated region
   in the country. But the UCLA researchers said the South was becoming
   resegregated more quickly than anywhere else in the nation.

   The educational outcomes of black children and white children remain
   glaring. Whites are nearly twice as likely to graduate from college
   than blacks, and that disparity informs, perpetuates, explains many of
   those messy, aforementioned issues like unemployment, earning potential
   and housing choices.

   The whole exercise of checking the march's platform can seem obvious
   and ham-handed, and many folks would argue that Saturday's
   [35]anniversary march should be about celebrating the hard-earned
   freedoms catalyzed by the march and its moment. But its planners called
   it the March on Washington For Jobs and Freedom for a reason.
