Editorial: What will Illinois pay?

Obamacare still doesn't look ready for prime time

   New polls indicate that a majority of Americans remain opposed to or
   confused over the Affordable Care Act, which will be open for
   enrollment Oct. 1. (Posted on: Sept. 16, 2013)

   5:59 p.m. CDT, September 16, 2013

   Two weeks from today, the online health insurance exchanges created
   under the Affordable Care Act are supposed to open for business,
   offering policies that will take effect starting Jan. 1. Illinois
   residents still have no clue what that insurance will cost, which
   companies will offer benefits, which doctors and hospitals will be
   included in the networks.

   Illinois officials have submitted proposed insurance plans and rates to
   the federal government, but haven't released any information on them.
   Illinois says its waiting on Washington for final approval. The feds
   have been silent.

   All this stokes suspicions that Illinois should brace for some sticker
   shock. Insurance rates for individual policies are expected to rise by
   30 to 40 percent in some states, depending on a person's, age, income
   and residence. Other states have announced that rates will fall.

            [140]This week's Scott Stantis Cartoon Caption
            contest[141]Scott Stantis cartoons

   Public opinion polls show many people still don't like or trust or
   understand the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. Illinois is supposed
   to launch a $35 million, federally funded campaign to counter that and
   spread the word about the benefits of the new law. But there's scant
   evidence of an outreach campaign. No surprise there -- how do you sell
   a product when you can't tell the customer what it costs?

   Nationally, Obamacare still doesn't look ready for prime time, as
   affected parties lobby for changes or delays or exemptions. In
   Illinois, it's a complete mystery.

   Two weeks to the launch ... such as it is.
