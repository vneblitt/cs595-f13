Historical Automobile Catalogs at NYPL: Early Advertising at Work and Play by

   First they invented the automobile. Then... marketing: How are we going
   to sell these things?

   One marketing tool was the catalog. And that gives a good opening to
   briefly talk about NYPL's extensive collection of historical automobile
   catalogs.

   [127][The Kissel cars on various roads.] , Digital ID 1163623, New York
   Public Library First, let me mention two existing resources on the NYPL
   website for automobile catalogs:
     * From the Digital Gallery: [128]Taking the Wheel: Manufacturers'
       Catalogs from the First Decade of American Automobiles. This is a
       collection guide, with a description of the digitized collection of
       catalogs from 1909, (a list of collection contents can be found
       [129]here, with some additional materials [130]here).
     * From our [131]Research Guides: Historical Automobile Catalogs - an
       alphabetical index to manufacturers catalogs from the pamphlet
       volumes starting with catalog number 3-TON n.c. (Another series of
       pamphlet volumes has call numbers starting with 3-TOP p.v. It is
       from this series most of the digital gallery images come).

   For the rest of this post, I thought I'd highlight three of the
   catalogs in the collection--identify the manufacturer and models, and
   pull out some descriptive copy from the catalog. Plus, a link to the
   catalog in "book" form on NYPL's new [132]digital collections browser
   (an interesting feature of the new interface). Before I start the list,
   I just want to point out that the digitized versions are selections
   from the catalog, focusing on images of the automobiles. The text I'm
   including is from the original hard copy.

   [133]The American Wayfarer; Five passenger; Four cylinder, 50-60 h. p.,
   $ 3,750., Digital ID 1159849, New York Public Library

   The American. 1909. American Motor Car Company, Indianapolis, Indiana
   Models available in 1909: Speedster, Limousine, Tourist, Traveler,
   Roadster, Wayfarer, Gadabout

   Call Number 3-TOP p.v. 47, No. 1

   [135]The American Roadster; Two or three passenger; Four cylinder, 50 -
   60 h.p., $ 3,750., Digital ID 1159839, New York Public Library

     At the very outset we want you to differentiate The American in your
     mind from any other car in which you have ever ridden.
     If this sense of difference is not apparent to you with the first
     ride you take in the American Roadster - we agree to abandon all
     claim on your consideration.
     We are speaking now particularly of the American Roadster, because
     this car embodies certain pronounced structural departures from
     accepted usage which establish it in a class by itself. ...

     The Kissel Kar for 1909 is the development and refinement of the
     preceding model. The principle is unchanged. The manufacturing of
     Kissel Kars has reached a stage where the entire organization is
     concentrated on refinement and betterment of detail, simplifying of
     some important unit, or making some improvement for the safety and
     comfort of the user and all with the end in view of continuing to
     make the Kissel Kar the BEST car for the money. Others may cost
     more. None can give better service.

   York Public Library

   Pennsylvania. 1909. Pennsylvania Auto Motor Company, Bryn Mawr,
   Pennsylvania
   Models available in 1909: Type "D", Type "C 50", Type "E 50"
   [140]Book
   Source Description: 1 v. : col. ill. ; 23 cm.

   [141]Pennsylvania type "C 50" automobile., Digital ID 1163724, New York
   Public Library

     It cannot be questioned that the "valve-in-the-head" or
     hemispherical motor is more efficient than the inverted "L" head or
     "T" head type. ... When you want to drive a nail, hit it on the
     head; when you want to drive a piston, explode the charge directly
     over the piston, not in ante-chambers. Think it over. ...

     The new group of "Pennsylvania 50's" will be practically the same as
     before. We carefully and faithfully recorded suggestions made by
     agents and customers, based upon thousands of miles, and found
     nothing worthy of consideration. ... Therefore, our Type "C 50" will
     be the same now and forever, as far as we can see.
