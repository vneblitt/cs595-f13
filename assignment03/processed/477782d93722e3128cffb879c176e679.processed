   Controversial freshman Sen. Ted Cruz is considering a 2016 presidential
   run, according to a report.

   "Ted won't be opening an Iowa office anytime soon, but he's listening,"
   an anonymous longtime friend of Cruz's told [40]National Review. "This
   is all in the early stages; nothing is official. It's just building on
   its own."

Cruz: 'I'll work with Martians'

   In a [42]Facebook post, Cruz dismissed talk of a presidential run as
   "wild speculation" -- without actually denying he'll run.

   ([43]QUIZ: Do you know Ted Cruz?)

   "I was elected because thousands of grassroots conservatives came
   together to protect the Constitution, shrink the federal government,
   and promote growth and opportunity," Cruz wrote. "It is a continued
   source of amazement that the simple fact that I am working hard with
   like-minded Senators to keep my promise is seen as newsworthy and cause
   for wild speculation."

   Cruz also said he viewed the Senate as the place he can best achieve
   his goals.

   "In my short tenure, my focus has been -- and will remain -- on two
   things: fighting for conservative principles in the Senate, and working
   to help elect strong conservatives to win a majority in the Senate in
   2014," he wrote. "The Senate is the battlefield to defend liberty."

   ([44]PHOTOS: Key quotes from Ted Cruz)

   The Texan has won the hearts of conservatives with aggressive
   questioning at hearings and by ignoring established protocol to jump
   into the spotlight during his first year in office. But his brusque
   manner has irritated many of his fellow Republicans in the upper
   chamber and angered Democrats.

   Cruz, the National Review piece argues, could be the pick of
   conservative movement members who have been disappointed by what they
   see as the failed presidential bids of moderate Republicans in the past
   two cycles.

   "You bet, he's on my radar," South Carolina Republican Party Chairman
   Chad Connelly told the magazine. "Conservatives think he's a rock star.
   I hear about him from everybody."

   Talk of Cruz launching a bid sparked cheers from conservatives

   on Twitter while Democrats and moderate Republicans were aghast.


     At rate he's going, he'd get less Latino support than Romney!
