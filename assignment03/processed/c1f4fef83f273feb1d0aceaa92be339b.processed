   ROANOKE, Va., Sept. 4, 2013 - Doctors who make house calls are rare,
   especially in urban settings like Roanoke. Nonetheless, students from
   the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine are taking to the streets
   throughout the local community.

   And they're treating much more than just the residents' health.

   These future doctors are getting involved in a variety of ways, from
   helping women who are shaking addictions to warning about the dangers
   of shaking infants. The students aren't the only ones doing the
   teaching, however, because these educational endeavors are a two-way
   street.

   "We're looking to educate well-rounded physicians, both inside the
   hospital and out," said Dr. David Trinkle, associate dean of community
   and culture at the school of medicine. "Through these service learning
   projects, we hope the students gain a better understanding and respect
   for the people in the community around them, their daily trials, and
   where the students' own passions can make a difference. By the end of
   their projects, they will have added value not just to their
   surroundings, but to themselves."

   That's the idea behind the school of medicine's inclusion of service
   learning into its curriculum. Earlier this year, teams of students
   spent several hours each week working with their chosen service
   organization.

   The projects offered the opportunity to interact with the public, work
   as a team, and work with populations with whom many have little
   experience. They also served as an avenue for the medical students to
   become acquainted with other health care professionals.

   As part of the program's emphasis on interprofessionalism, each service
   project team is composed of a mix of students from the school of
   medicine and Jefferson College of Health Sciences, which trains nurses,
   physician assistants, and other health professionals. The goal is to
   have the different professions learn to work together and respect one
   another's roles in health care so they can work more effectively as a
   team to improve patient care.

   It seems to be working.

   "We thought we had a good idea of what the project would require going
   in," said Lauren Cantwell, a member of the Class of 2016 whose team
   worked to make improvements to a local community garden. "But it turned
   out that it wasn't nearly as easy as we thought it would be. The
   project created an environment where we had to practice problem solving
   as a team."

   Cantwell's group worked with the Campbell Avenue Community Garden to
   build compost bins and teach the garden's tenders about composting in
   an effort to reduce waste and promote healthier living in the
   neighborhood. They also educated the local community about nutrition
   and planted flowers to create a more attractive community park space.

   Cantwell and her group got involved in their project through the
   Community Service Project Fair that kicked off the program.
   Representatives from local nonprofit organizations were present to
   offer project ideas. While some groups, like Cantwell's, hunted for a
   good fit, others did not need much time.

   Salina Khushal and her group knew immediately that they wanted to work
   with the Child Health Investment Partnership of Roanoke Valley. CHIP
   suggested they use an infant simulator to educate caregivers about
   shaken baby syndrome. Although it looks like a doll, the simulator
   cries inconsolably just like a real baby.

   But unlike with an actual infant, accelerometers in the head measure
   the force of a shake, which cause lights embedded in the doll's skull
   to flash as an indication of brain damage.

   The group split up into pairs and spread their time between Carilion
   Clinic's obstetrics and gynecology services and the Salem and Roanoke
   YMCAs. "Everyone we talked to was a future caregiver," said Khushal.
   "And everyone we worked with probably talked to other future caregivers
   in their household - friends, family, babysitters - so we had a
   multiplicative effect.

   "We had all heard of shaken baby syndrome before but didn't really know
   much about it," continued Khushal. "We discovered this was a common
   theme. We were telling people about things they thought they knew. But
   almost without fail there was shock on their faces when they saw how
   little effort and how little time it takes to cause brain damage in an
   infant."

   Working with children was a common theme. Another group spent time at
   the Roanoke Rescue Mission, a shelter serving disadvantaged local
   families. There, the team helped watch children while their mothers
   attended mandatory chapel time after dinner. The students read to them,
   played games, and gave them one-on-one time. On the last visit, they
   brought popcorn and drinks and hosted a movie night featuring
   Madagascar 3.

   "It was a group I hadn't been exposed to very much and it was
   eye-opening to realize how much the kids simply appreciated the
   attention," said Russel Trigonis, one of the team's members.

   "What struck me was how generous the kids were," echoed Nikki Kumar.
   "Every time we brought them anything they would share it without a
   second thought. They have so little but they were very giving anyway."

   The projects wrapped up right where they began - in the school of
   medicine's common room. After giving brief presentations about their
   projects, the groups joined representatives of the schools and
   nonprofit organizations for a poster session. As visitors learned about
   the different projects, they voted for their three favorites by putting
   red stickers on the posters.

   At the session's conclusion, the poster with the most stickers belonged
   to a group that worked with Bethany Hall, a local shelter focused on
   helping addicted women become sober and get back on their feet.
   Although the group had initially planned to conduct lectures on topics
   of the residents' choice, they quickly realized that the women were
   already getting much of the information through their rehabilitation
   program. The students also noticed that the recovery efforts of the
   women in the shelter were often interrupted by their children.

   Plans were quickly changed to providing child care. The group's members
   worked out their schedules to take turns working two-hour blocks so the
   women could focus on recovery without distraction. The students still
   offered information sessions, but the sessions were much less didactic
   than originally planned, taking on more of a discussion forum.

   "As students we're trapped in a bubble with peers who are just trying
   to pass a class," said group member Eric Kim. "We don't get to interact
   that often with people having real-world troubles, like trying to find
   a job while recovering from an addiction and taking care of a newborn.
   And working with a small organization like Bethany Hall made the
   experience more meaningful for us - and, I think, for them as well."

   The [160]Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research
   Institute joins the basic science, life science, bioinformatics, and
   engineering strengths of Virginia Tech with the medical practice and
   medical education experience of Carilion Clinic. Virginia Tech Carilion
   is located in a new biomedical health sciences campus in Roanoke at 2
   Riverside Circle.
