   September 19, 2013

   Program Locations:
   Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, South Court Auditorium


   In honor of World Alzheimer's Month, the New York Public Library is
   pleased to present a special screening of the highly acclaimed
   documentary, You're Looking at Me Like I Live Here and I Don't*,  which
   aired nationally on PBS' Emmy award-winning series [134]Independent
   Lens. A total immersion into the fragmented day-to-day experience of
   mental illness,You're Looking at Me Like I Live Here and I Don't is the
   first documentary filmed exclusively in a unit specifically for care of
   those with Alzheimer's & other dementias, and the first told from the
   perspective of someone suffering from Alzheimer's disease. It is a
   touching account of Lee Gorewitz's life inside the Traditions
   Alzheimer's & Other Dementia Care Unit at the The Reutlinger Community
   for Jewish Living in Danville, California. The film reveals Lee's
   penetrating ruminations and charismatic vitality, challenging our
   preconceptions of illness and aging. Here is the journey of a woman who
   will not let us forget her - even as she struggles to remember herself.

   The screening will be followed by a panel discussion exploring the
   intersection of medical research in the field, the arts, social
   services, and the quality of life of individuals living with
   Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Panelists will include
   Lou-Ellen Barkan, President & CEO, [135]Alzheimer's Association/New
   York City Chapter; [136]Alison Willmore, TV Editor, Indiewire; James E.
   Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., lead researcher from [137]New York University
   Langone School of Medicine; and filmmaker Scott Kirschenbaum.

   The screening is free and open to the public. If you have questions or
   would like to make a request for group accommodations, please email
   Brigid Cahalan ([138]brigidcahalan@nypl.org).


   *Total running time: 53 minutes.
