       Ed. note: This is part of a series of blog posts written by
       Administration officials in recognition of the 50th anniversary of
       the historic March on Washington. [154]Read more here.
       It was an honor to speak at the National Action to Realize the
       Dream March this morning to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
       March on Washington.
       Fifty years ago, Dr. King shared his dream with the world and
       described his vision for a society that offered, and delivered, the
       promise of equal justice under the law. He assured his fellow
       citizens that this goal was within reach - so long as they kept
       faith with one another, and maintained the courage and commitment
       to work toward it.
       And he urged them to do just that. By calling for no more - and no
       less - than equal justice. By standing up for the civil rights to
       which everyone is entitled. And by speaking out - in the face of
       hatred and violence, in defiance of those who sought to turn them
       back with fire hoses, bullets, and bombs - for the dignity of a
       promise kept; the honor of a right redeemed; and the pursuit of a
       sacred truth that's been woven through our history since this
       country's earliest days: that all are created equal.
       Those who marched on Washington in 1963 had taken a long and
       difficult road - from Montgomery, to Greensboro, to Birmingham;
       through Selma and Tuscaloosa. They marched - in spite of animosity,
       oppression, and brutality - because they believed in the greatness
       of what this nation could become and despaired of the founding
       promises not kept. Their focus, at that time, was the sacred and
       sadly unmet commitments of the American system as it applied to
       African Americans.
       As we gather today, 50 years later, their march - now our march -
       goes on. And our focus has broadened to include the cause of women,
       of Latinos, of Asian Americans, of lesbians, of gays, of people
       with disabilities, and of countless others across this country who
       still yearn for equality, opportunity, and fair treatment. We
       recognize that we are forever bound to one another and that we
       stand united by the work that lies ahead - and by the journey that
       still stretches before us.
       This morning, we affirm that this struggle must, and will, go on in
       the cause of our nation's quest for justice - until every eligible
       American has the chance to exercise his or her right to vote,
       unencumbered by discriminatory or unneeded procedures, rules, or
       practices. It must go on until our criminal justice system can
       ensure that all are treated equally and fairly in the eyes of the
       law. And it must go on until every action we take reflects our
       values and that which is best about us. It must go on until those
       now living, and generations yet to be born, can be assured the
       rights and opportunities that have been too long denied to too
       many.
