Librarian ProFile: It's Amazing To Hear A Person's Voice Change In Their
Career

   by [26]Hannah Sommers
   August 23, 2013 1:35 PM

   This month, the NPR Arts Desk has been exploring the role of public
   libraries in the U.S. and how it's evolved over the years. The
   fascinating series, [27]Keys to the Whole World: American Public
   Libraries, got us curious about what's happening in our own library at
   NPR. It provides instrumental services to staff from research and
   training, to developing massive music and radio story databases, to
   preserving and digitizing NPR's huge collection of audio. So basically
   it's oil in the gears around here, and the librarians themselves are
   rock stars ([28]one of them literally is). A great example is NPR
   librarian Hannah Sommers. Check out her ProFile here, no library card
   required.

   My name... Hannah Sommers

   NPR employee since... 2004

   Public radio listener since... I spent an entire summer listening to
   [29]WVPE while I organized, relabeled and restocked the Chemistry
   Department supply rooms at my alma mater, Goshen College. It was 1994
   and there was a lot going on around the world. I became hooked on
   international news (AND we passed OSHA inspection!).

   My job at NPR is... a new and evolving role: Program Manager in the NPR
   Library. This job didn't exist two years ago. My job is to make sure
   that music and archived stories are easily accessible to journalists
   and others who needs them. The life of a story after broadcast is a
   very interesting one!

   My first job... my friend and I joined a corn detasseling crew one
   summer in Indiana before high school. We thought it would be fun, which
   it was, in addition to being really hard work.

   I wanted to be... a doctor when I grew up. Then I got some real-world
   experience in the profession. I love my doctors, but I don't envy the
   decisions they have to make.

   I've learned the most about radio from... David Julian Gray [NPR IT
   product manager] and [Morning Edition Senior Producer] Barry Gordemer.
   David can explain everything about the production and behavior of sound
   waves. Barry is a generous teacher when it comes to the magic of
   storytelling.

   The story I was most surprised to come across while digitizing the NPR
   archive was... not so much a story as a perspective: It's amazing to
   hear how a person's voice changes in the course of their career. Robert
   Siegel, for instance, sounds so different now than when he was
   reporting from London in the early 1980s. Theme music is another fun
   thing to listen to across time and compare.

   Listening is most important when... there are passionate people around
   the table and a deadline to meet. My job is to make sure the best ideas
   advance regardless of how forcefully they are promoted.

   One idea that defines us is... a belief as professionals that everyone
   should have access to quality information to make the decisions that
   life and work require.

   I can't live without... good dim sum now and then. I also can't live
   without our [30]Serendipity Days because the result is real innovation.
   For example, not long ago we experimented with a new search engine and
   decided to keep it in our product. A great investment of just 2 days.

   The Newscast headline reporting the last year in my life would be... a
   timeless one: Proud Parents Welcome Baby Daughter: "We're Over The
   Moon".
