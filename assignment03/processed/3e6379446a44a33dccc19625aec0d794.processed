   8:21 p.m. CDT, September 16, 2013

   WASHINGTON -- Aaron Alexis lived for a time in a bungalow in the woods
   near a Buddhist temple in Fort Worth, Texas, where he occasionally
   joined Thai immigrants in meditation. Aaron Alexis died Monday in a gun
   battle with police in a building at the Washington Navy Yard after he
   killed at least 12 people.

   In between, the man named as the shooter in Monday's mass murder at
   Navy Yard Building 197 was discharged from the Navy Reserve, arrested
   for shooting a bullet into his downstairs neighbor's apartment and then
   asked to leave his Fort Worth apartment.

   A Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Alexis was
   discharged in January 2011 for "a pattern of misconduct" and that the
   2010 gun incident in Texas played a role in his departure.

   The Navy revised an earlier account of Alexis' 2011 departure that he
   had received a "general discharge." Although the service had originally
   sought to kick him out with a less-desirable general discharge after
   he'd been cited for misconduct at least eight times, the Navy instead
   granted Alexis an honorable discharge when he applied to leave.
   The Navy cited Alexis for insubordination in 2008, disorderly conduct
   in 2009 and extended unauthorized absences between 2008 and 2010,
   according to a Navy official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
   discuss the alleged gunman's personnel record. Alexis was also cited
   for minor offenses such as a traffic ticket and showing up late.

   But Alexis, 34, had no trouble landing a civilian job. He moved from
   Fort Worth to Washington about a month ago, friends said, and was hired
   as an hourly tech employee for The Experts, a Hewlett-Packard
   subcontractor that is updating computer systems at Navy and Marine
   Corps installations worldwide. He was scheduled to begin work at the
   Washington Navy Yard this month.

   Investigators Monday night were examining how Alexis got into the Navy
   Yard, and whether he had or used the identification card of a former
   Navy petty officer that was found near Alexis's body after police
   killed him.

   Those who knew Alexis in recent years describe him as a "sweet and
   intelligent guy" (a regular customer at the Thai restaurant where he
   worked as a waiter), as "a good boy" (his landlord), but also as
   someone who was "very aggressive," someone who seemed like he might one
   day kill himself (a lay worker at the Buddhist temple where Alexis
   worshipped.)

   In 2004, Alexis was arrested in Seattle after he fired three shots from
   a Glock pistol into the tires of a Honda Accord that two construction
   workers had parked in a driveway adjacent to Alexis' s house. Alexis's
   father told Seattle detectives then that his son "had experienced anger
   management problems that the family believed was associated with PTSD,"
   or post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the police report. The
   father said that Alexis "was an active participant in rescue attempts
   of Sept. 11, 2001."

   Alexis's own explanation for his behavior that day: the construction
   workers had "mocked" and "disrespected" him and then he had had "a
   black-out fueled by anger."

   Alexis was not charged in the Seattle incident.

   More recently, Alexis struck those who crossed his path as a man of
   sharp contrasts. He studied the Thai language, visited Thailand for a
   month, was studying for an online degree in aeronautical engineering
   and seemed to enjoy conversing with customers, according to friends,
   customers and fellow worshippers. But some of those same people said
   that Alexis had an aggressive streak, one that caused them to keep
   their distance and avoid personal questions.

   Alexis grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., with his mother Sarah and father
   Anthony Alexis, according to his aunt Helen Weeks. "We haven't seen him
   for years," Weeks said in a phone interview. "I know he was in the
   military. He served abroad. I think he was doing some kind of computer
   work."

   Alexis spent nearly four years in the Navy as a full-time reservist
   from May 2007 until he was discharged in January 2011, according to a
   summary of personnel records released by the Navy. A Navy official,
   speaking on condition of anonymity, said Alexis was discharged from the
   service in January 2011 for "misconduct," and that the 2010 firearms
   incident in Texas played a role in his departure.

   He achieved his final rank of Aviation Electrician's Mate 3rd Class in
   December 2009.

   Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said Alexis worked as a defense contractor
   after his discharge. A deleted LinkedIn page under Alexis's name listed
   SinglePoint Technologies, a Richmond, Va., firm, as his employer; the
   company did not return a call seeking comment.

   Alexis spent the bulk of his service time -- from 2008 to 2011 --
   assigned to the Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 46 at Naval Air
   Station Fort Worth in Texas, from 2008 until he left the service in
   2011, records show. He was awarded the Global War on Terrorism Service
   Medal and the National Defense Service Medal -- two awards of minor
   distinction.

   In Fort Worth, Alexis lived for a time in a gated townhouse community
   called Orion at Oak Hill. In September, 2010, police were called to
   Apartment 2023 after Alexis's downstairs neighbor complained that
   Alexis had fired a bullet through his floor and into her ceiling below.

   The woman told police that she had had occasion to call them about
   Alexis several times for being too loud, but that nothing had been
   done. The woman said Alexis had confronted her a few days earlier in
   the complex's parking lot, where he complained that she had been making
   too much noise. The woman told police that "she is terrified of Aaron
   and feels that this was done intentionally," the police report said.

   Police made three attempts to contact Alexis by knocking on his door,
   but he didn't respond. Only after police called in firefighters to
   force entry into his apartment did Alexis emerge. Alexis then told
   police that he had been cleaning his gun while he was cooking and his
   hands had become greasy and the weapon discharged by accident,
   according to the police report.

   "He told me that he began to take the gun apart when his hands slipped
   and pulled the trigger, discharging a round into the ceiling," the
   officer wrote.
