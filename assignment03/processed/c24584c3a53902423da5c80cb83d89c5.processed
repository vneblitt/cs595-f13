Missouri State Rep. Wieland Needs to Reconsider His Priorities

   Expansion, [45]Missouri, [46]State Rep. Paul Wieland

   Missouri State Representative Paul Wieland (R-Imperial) recently filed
   a federal lawsuit suit asking the court to [47]declare the mandate for
   contraception coverage in Obamacare unconstitutional.  More
   specifically, he's looking for a [48]personal exemption for his family
   (the fact that Wieland is a man, who would probably find little use for
   birth control, is apparently beside the point).  Either he missed the
   news that a federal judge struck down the Missouri law exempting moral
   objectors from mandatory birth control coverage earlier this year, or
   he needs to readjust his  priorities.

   This isn't the only thing he seems to be misguided on:  his lack of
   support for Medicaid expansion in Missouri points to Rep. Wieland's
   need to get his priorities back on track.

   In Jefferson County, 9,929 of Rep. Wieland's constituents would gain
   access to health insurance through Medicaid expansion.  [49]According
   to the Missouri Medicaid Coalition, Medicaid expansion will decrease
   the burden on Jefferson County emergency rooms, and local hospitals
   would no longer face dire financial consequences resulting from nearly
   $400 million in lost Missouri hospital funding.  And Jefferson County
   residents could look forward to new jobs in the region, part of the
   24,000 additional jobs in Missouri estimated to result from Medicaid
   expansion.

   Rather than pander to special interest groups opposed to birth control,
   Rep. Wieland needs to focus on what's best for Jefferson County.

   Missouri is the Show-Me State and we want Rep. Wieland to show us he
   actually cares about his community by dropping his political attack on
   the birth control mandate and supporting the effort to expand access to
   health care through Medicaid.

   If you are a Missouri resident, take action now and demand that [50]the
   Missouri legislature expand Medicaid in 2014!
