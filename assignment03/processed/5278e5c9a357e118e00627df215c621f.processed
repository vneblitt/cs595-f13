Kendrick Lamar Rips Lame Diss Tracks -- TRY HARDER, BITCHES!!!

   9/12/2013 4:00 AM PDT [29]BY TMZ STAFF
   Kendrick Lamar
   Rips Lame Diss Tracks
   TRY HARDER BITCHES!!!
   Exclusive
   [30]091113_kendrick_lamar_launch Kendrick Lamar's got words for all the
   MCs coughing up weak ass responses to his explosive "Control" verse ...
   telling TMZ, "THEY GOTTA TRY HARDER."
   We don't need to recap, but we will: Kendrick dropped bombs on every
   rapper in the game last month, calling out nearly a dozen fellow MCs BY
   NAME in his verse on Big Sean's new track "Control." Among the lyrics
   ...
   I'm usually homeboys with the same n****s I'm rhymin' wit
   But this is hip-hop and them n****s should know what time it is
   And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big KRIT, Wale
   Pusha T, Meek Mill, A$AP Rocky, Drake
   Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
   I got love for you all but I'm tryna murder you n****s
   Scores of rappers have since responded to the verse -- including
   [31]Meek Mill and dozens who weren't even mentioned on the track -- but
   King Kendrick's not impressed ... at all.
   He did show some love for Diddy though, despite Diddy [32]blasting him
   on Instagram. Check the clip.

   It makes no sense that one untalented loser would call out other
   untalented losers in a song.. Would make more sense if people actually
   knew or heard about half of these douche bags..

   That's right King Kendrick. Keep challenging the lames. Maybe just
   maybe they'll step up to the plate and add some substance to their
   lyrics. No one cares about nor relates to their cars, jewelry, hoes or
   drug addiction. Either he'll change the game or he'll continue to rule
   over them.

   Stupid sh*t like this is the reason rappers like Biggie and Tupac are
   no longer with us....if you have to "diss" someone to sell a record,
   you have no talent.

   Kendrick Lamar is not a good rapper. If other rappers needed him to
   'motivate' them to make decent music, then they're clearly not doing
   what they should be doing in the first place. Yes, I listen to rap
   music, but you'd never hear it on the radio... independent artists are
   the only ones who put ANY real effort into their music anymore. And no,
   they don't rap about drugs, strippers, guns, shoes or how much money
   they have... it's REAL MUSIC and trust me when I say, none of them
   wasted their time making a 'Kendrick Lamar diss/comeback' song.
