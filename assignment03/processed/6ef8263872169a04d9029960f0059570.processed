   BLACKSBURG, Va., May 10, 2013 - The [160]Center for the Arts at
   Virginia Tech will offer a dynamic range of programming -- from
   timeless classics and family-friendly offerings, to works with deep
   meaning and global themes, to events with a fresh and sometimes
   unexpected perspective -- for its inaugural 2013-14 season in the new
   arts center.

   Season subscriptions are on sale now for the lineup of 21 performances
   by international, national and regional touring performing artists and
   companies, in the center's new on-campus [161]facility on the corner of
   Main St. and Alumni Mall.

   "Our team has carefully crafted a season full of a rich range of
   experiences, and this is just the beginning," said Ruth Waalkes,
   associate provost for the arts and executive director for the Center
   for the Arts at Virginia Tech. "In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing
   more details about our opening events, including exhibitions in our
   visual arts galleries that will merge tradition with innovation;
   boundary-breaking projects developed through the Institute for
   Creativity, Arts, and Technology; as well as unique opportunities to
   engage more deeply with our artists, their works, and topics they
   illuminate. We hope you'll join us as we embark on this grand new
   journey when we open our doors to the Center for the Arts this fall."

   communities. The cornerstone of the initiative is the [187]Center for
   the Arts at Virginia Tech. Opening in late 2013, the Center for the
   Arts will include a 1,260-seat, state-of-the-art performance hall for
   music, theatre, and dance performance and visual arts galleries for
   traditional, digital, and new media exhibitions. Center programs will

   learning opportunities. The center is uniquely partnered with the
   Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology, an applied research
   environment housed in the center wherein researchers from multiple
   disciplines partner to prepare students in kindergarten through 12th
   grade and higher education environments to succeed in a world that
   demands teamwork and collaboration, and to promote new research domains
   that transcend institutionalized boundaries.
