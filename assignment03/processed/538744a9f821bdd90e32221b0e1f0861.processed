   Cultural stereotypes around food remain, according to Marilyn Morgan,
   the professor behind the Harvard Summer School course "Gender, Food and
   Culture in American History." An early look: "The best toast I ever
   tasted," 1939 (photo 1); "How to enjoy your 1951 General Electric

   By Corydon Ireland, Harvard Staff Writer

   [83]Harvard Summer School is old, since it opened in 1871 as the first
   university summer studies program in the nation. But it's also young,
   since nearly a quarter of its 6,000 students this summer were teenagers
   in its [84]Secondary School Program.

   The Summer School also extends well beyond Harvard Yard. There were 28
   overseas programs, including in China, France, Israel, and Kenya. (One
   recent student summed up international study by saying: "We had to take
   off our American goggles.")

   And the seven-week summer program is big, with more than 300 courses.
   From late June to early August, students studied the Vietnam War, fairy
   tales, the anthropology of childhood, utopia, Bob Dylan (a seminar),
   the odes of Horace, astrobiology, video editing, the Harlem
   Renaissance, environmental crises, the early plays of Shakespeare, and
   digital storytelling. Students also did writing involving journalism,
   novels, short stories, travel, and food.

   Food was the star of one course, [85]SWGS S-1155, better known as
   "Gender, Food and Culture in American History." The professor was
   [86]Marilyn Morgan, a manuscripts cataloger at the [87]Schlesinger
   Library who has a Ph.D. in American history. The course's guiding idea
   is that food isn't just something to eat. It's a shared cultural
   experience that on close examination reveals a lot about gender, race,
   and class.

   By the end, it taught a sobering lesson, at least regarding gender in
   advertising. "Not much has changed," said Morgan. Food roles are as
   gendered now as they were in the America of nearly 200 years ago. "I
   still am astonished over how clueless people are to these sexist ads
   and norms in society," wrote student Elizabeth Greif in an email,
   adding italics to the next sentence: "This stuff is still happening
   today!"

   When the students read snippets of food writing from 1841, 1898, and
   the present, Morgan said not one could identify the era of a single
   text. Women are still largely perceived as the ones responsible for
   buying, preparing, and serving food, she said -- as well as the ones to
   blame if things go wrong.

   Grinding, gritty, rewarding

   The 13 students in the class covered a lot of demographic ground,
   typical of Harvard Summer School. Four were from high school (including
   Greif, a rising senior from desert-bound Quartz Hill, Calif.); two came
   from overseas; and many of the others were Southerners. They joined to
   study print and television ads, 19th-century treatises on domestic
   skills, vintage cookbooks, and decades of scholarship on the
   intersection of what we eat and who we are.

   The coursework offered a lesson in what the Summer School means: seven
   weeks of grinding, gritty -- but rarified and rewarding -- work.
   "Admittedly there was a lot of reading," Alabaman Mia Tankersley '14
   said in an email. "But honestly, having to reflect on the evolution of
   macaroni in the United States or soul food didn't feel like work."

   Another student, Nadine Mannering, who arrived this summer with a
   master's degree from her native Australia, said the workload was
   "fairly intense," but it was the first time she had been in college
   without having to work at a paying job, too. "I relished the
   opportunity to actually focus on my studies first."

   Morgan's students averaged 150 pages of reading per class, 300 pages a
   week. Using new software, they illustrated timelines that could eat up
   half a day. And their weekly writing assignments, brightened and honed,
   appeared on [88]a class blog that remains open and active. "They
   learned," said Morgan, that "the real challenge was how to write
   effectively in that short a space."

   The writing is tight, and the timelines enlightening. (In the one on
   canned food, we learn that the billionth can of Spam was produced in
   1959. In another, we get this sweet bit: 400 million M&Ms are made
   every day in the United States.) The texts also use vintage ads as
   points of argument. A 1950s [89]TV pitch for instant coffee contains a
   minute of husband-wife food dynamics that today would make anyone
   queasy. (Instant coffee got its first popularity bump with men during
   World War II, said Greif, who studied it for her final project. But
   advertisements often "included women serving a cup to men," she said,
   "despite how easy it would have been for the man to make the coffee
   himself.")

   Using primary sources

   The students' final research papers required primary sources, in this
   case, mostly from Schlesinger. The library, part of the Radcliffe
   Institute of Advanced Study, houses the richest American women's
   history collections, including the papers of chef [90]Julia Child and
   early feminist [91]Charlotte Perkins Gilman.

   Gilman, whose "Women and Economics" (1898) was on the course reading
   list, wanted women to change their house-centric identities. "A house
   does not need a wife any more than it needs a husband," she wrote, a
   sentiment that put her at odds with her anti-suffragist aunt,
   [92]Catharine Beecher, whose 1845 "Treatise on Domestic Economy" was
   also required reading. Aunt and niece were opposing bookends in the
   19th-century debate over the role of women, an uneasy tension that
   still exists today. "I'm a feminist who loves to bake," said
   Tankersley, "and I constantly think about what that means and why I'm
   conflicted about it."

   By the end of class, most of the final papers used foods -- rather than
   personalities -- as a cultural lens. Many were previewed in the student
   timelines, including looks at food preservation, M&Ms, peanut butter,
   wedding cake, pineapple (marketed as "glam" and exotic in the 1950s),
   artificial sweeteners, and Cream of Wheat. The last product was part of
   a leitmotif in class, what Morgan called an "archetype of using
   subservient Others" to sell a product in the 20th century.

   For Cream of Wheat, at first, that "Other" was Rastus, a black man in a
   chef's hat and white coat. For other products, it was Aunt Jemima or
   Uncle Ben. "There were too many surprises to count," said Tankersley of
   the course, including the true story of Aunt Jemima. She was Nancy
   Green, a former slave hired in 1893 to promote pancake mix at the
   Chicago World's Fair.

   The female hand in the universe of preparing food gets more subtle as
   advertising enters the era of second-wave feminism. Gone are the women
   in dresses pouring coffee or fussing over cakes in the daytime. But
   women are still in the kitchen, as in the [93]TV ad Mannering used in
   her study of Tupperware parties -- marketing artifacts of the 1950s
   that today still limit the hostess-saleswoman to commissions only.
   "Though we always think we've come so far, there (are) always, always
   things that need to be worked on," Mannering said. "We should never
   (assume) everyone's being treated equally and fairly."

   Meanwhile, men remain just as stuck in their food roles of 50 years
   ago, mostly as guilt-free consumers of high-calorie snacks. The final
   flowering of that role might be the "Get Some Nuts" [94]TV ads for
   Snickers, a "man candy" chock full of protein and energy. In food ads,
   women aspire to low calories, satisfaction, and even [95]female agency
   -- from yogurt, say, a product still largely pitched to one gender. The
   marketing subtext often even co-opts a standard second-wave feminist
   joke: Who needs men? (When you have yogurt, at least.)

   Summer demographics

   The same joke, in its own way, was repeated in the course. Of 13
   students, only one was a man, a fact that Morgan attributed to having
   "gender" in the course title.

   But the demographics in this class were in other ways typical of the
   Summer School. The four high school students made up about a quarter of
   the class, the same proportion as in the whole program. There were two
   foreign students in the class, from Taiwan and Australia. In the School
   at large, the percentage of international students is higher, 37
   percent last year. Mannering, who works for a bank in Melbourne, took
   three months off to tour the United States, but started her visit with
   the course. "I was flattered," said Morgan.

   "I wanted a base in the States," said Mannering, "so I chose summer
   school. Harvard was an obvious choice as it's -- in my mind -- the best
   university in the world. Doing summer school allowed me to get to know
   Cambridge and Boston, and have a temporary `home' in America."

   The undergraduates in the course were also expressive of a geographical
   range -- New York, Virginia, Alabama -- that that is typical for
   Harvard year-round.

   Something else about Morgan's students was likely true of everyone at
   the Summer School. "Most were exploring something about themselves,"
   she said. That included a native Southerner (now a Boston-area lawyer)
   who did a final paper on North Carolina barbeque, and was shocked to
   discover that most such operations are run by men. (That matched
   Morgan's general take on food prep: Women cook, men grill.)

   There's yet another way that the course was like a lot of others at the
   Summer School: There was fun, too. Students could join the gym, play in
   a pops band or orchestra, row on the Charles River, volunteer at
   nonprofits, take sponsored tours around Boston, or venture out to Cape
   Cod or Tanglewood or even as far as Rhode Island or Maine.

   "Boston is just a T stop away," said Greif, the Californian teenager.
   "History and more history await to be explored, and I want to explore
   everything."

   Morgan's students took time on a July Saturday to visit the outdoor
   market at Haymarket and the food-intensive Feast of St. Joseph street
   festival in Boston's North End. The trip included a look at the site of
   the landmark [96]Boston Cooking School (1879-1902), where Fannie
   Farmer, of cookbook fame, studied and taught.

   What inspired the course? For one, Morgan read the Works Progress
   Administration slave narratives as a graduate student, with an eye to
   how former slaves would "use food as a means of exerting power in a
   situation in which they were powerless." It was slavery, and the legacy
   of African foods and spices, that made Southern cooking what it is, she
   said. Food historian [97]Frederick Douglass Opie, author of "[98]Hog
   and Hominy: Soul Food from Africa to America" (2008) was a guest
   lecturer. He was a 2012-2013 fellow at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute.

   Morgan was also inspired by her work at Schlesinger, which last year
   included cataloging the papers of [99]Jean Wade Rindlaub, a New York
   advertising executive who, among other things, created ads for cake
   mixes and other convenience foods. Her secret involved direct emotional
   appeals to women. Her papers are a window into the machinery of
   marketing food.

   Mannering was struck by how different advertising is in Australia.
   "There is a lot of `mother-guilt' in American advertising," she said,
   "brands telling women that their product is healthy and best for their
   child in an attempt to create insecurities and secure the demographic."

   More than one student came away from Morgan's class with a critical eye
   on sugar, which Tankersley said food companies are increasingly adding
   to make up for using less fat. "I could go on and on about how
   dangerous it is for us, but let's just say that after that class I was
   prepared to swear off all sugar (aside from fruit)," she wrote. "Then I
   made a beeline for a cup of coffee Oreo ice cream. So it's a work in
   progress."
