[25]U.S., China, And G-20 Nations Take Big Step Forward To Regulate Potent
Greenhouse Gases

   Meeting during the G-20, President Barack Obama and Chinese President
   Xi Jinping have agreed to establish a contact group under the
   [27]Montreal Protocol on the potent greenhouse gases known as
   hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) -- a significant step following the
   presidential agreement to work together on HFCs three months ago. The
   G-20 also announced it supported serious progress in the U.N. climate
   talks in addition to using the Montreal Protocol to phase down HFCs.
   This could mean serious momentum for quick action to cut greenhouse
   gases now.

   Back in June, the U.S. and China first formally agreed to use the
   expertise and institutions of the Montreal Protocol of 1987 to phase
   down the consumption and production of HFCs. This could eliminate
   [28]90 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (or two years' worth)
   by 2050. John Podesta, Chair of the Center for American Progress and
   former White House chief of staff spoke about the importance of this
   next step:

     Today, this initiative has become a reality, with the two leaders
     pushing to initiate the formal process of using the Montreal
     Protocol to achieve this end. Their first opportunity will come this
     October when the parties of the protocol convene in Bangkok. This is
     the same agreement that successfully phased out chlorofluorocarbons,
     saving the world from the threat of the hole in the ozone layer. It
     must now be used to eliminate HFCs, which, if left unabated, are
     projected to increase twenty-fold in the next three decades,
     comparable to the total current annual emissions from the global
     transportation sector.

   HFCs are primarily used as refrigerants and can be found in any
   household with a refrigerator or air conditioner. Unlike their
   ozone-depleting predecessors in these applications,
   hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HFCs
   are completely innocuous when it comes to the ozone layer. They are,
   however, extremely potent greenhouse gases. The most commonly used HFC,
   [29]HFC-134a is 1,430 times more damaging to the atmosphere than carbon
   dioxide and other chemicals in this class are up to tens of thousands
   of times more potent. The phase out of ozone depleting substances under
   the Montreal Protocol of 1987 has been effective at removing the
   production and consumption of these substances. Kofi Annan, called the
   Montreal Protocol "perhaps the [30]single most successful international
   agreement to date" in his 2009 Millennium Report as the Secretary
   General of the United Nations.

   Yet the predominant substitutes for HCFCs and CFCs are HFCs. Given
   current demand in developing countries for refrigerators and other HFC
   containing technologies, if unchecked, HFC emissions are projected to
   grow to nearly 20 percent of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Today,
   they account for just two percent.

   The monumental announcement in June came after four years of work by
   the U.S., Canada, and Mexico on a proposed amendment to the Montreal
   Protocol to slowly ratchet down HFC production globally and require
   reporting. Over 100 countries have signed declarations to address HFCs
   under the Montreal Protocol. World leaders agreed to support a
   phasedown in the consumption and production of HFCs at the Rio+20
   United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in June 2012.

   Now, leaders of the G-20 economies representing approximately 80
   percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions endorsed a phasedown of
   HFCs using the expertise of the Montreal Protocol. But there remains
   strong opposition to an amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The main
   opponents have been India and Brazil. The next opportunity for these
   countries to join China in getting on board will be at the October
   meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol in Bangkok. This is
   where rhetoric could turn into reality.

   Acting quickly to limit the production and consumption of HFCs, which
   unlike carbon dioxide that can remain in the atmosphere for 100 years,
   only has a lifetime of 15 years, could prevent half a degree Celsius of
   warming by the end of the century. This would be essential for keeping
   temperature increase at no more than 2 degree Celsius over
   pre-industrial average temperatures, which world leaders agreed to
   during international climate talks in 2009 at Cancun. Temperatures have
   already risen by 1 degree Celsius.

   In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency `s [31]Significant New
   Alternatives Policy or SNAP Program evaluates and regulates substances
   that can replace ozone-depleting chemicals and also provides guidance
   on acceptable substitutes for HFCs that have a lighter impact on the
   climate.

   The Montreal Protocol also has the technical expertise to provide
   guidance on the viability, reliability and costs of alternatives.
   China's real action on this issue today, along with new support from
   the G-20, will spur concrete action on the further development and use
   of HFC alternatives.
