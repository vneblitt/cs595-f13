       Momentum is growing in the House of Representatives to pass
       comprehensive immigration reform. Since [45]Action August began,
       six more Republican congressmen have publicly endorsed a pathway to
       earned citizenship.
       OFA supporters held events in each of their districts Monday to
       thank them for standing with our country's future.
       OFA-Modesto
       In Modesto, California, OFA volunteers rallied at Congressman Jeff
       Denham's office and spoke with his staff to thank him for his
       comments in support of reform. On Friday, August 16th, Congressman
       Denham attended a town hall organized by CBS-PICO and Mi Familia
       Vota, where the congressman re-affirmed his support for a pathway
       to citizenship and repeatedly said it's time to fix our immigration
       system.
       OFA-NV
       Congressman Joe Heck is one of the newest Republican congressmen to
       endorse a pathway to citizenship, and OFA volunteers visited his
       office in Las Vegas, Nevada, to say thank you.
       OFA-IL
       "To Mr. Schock, I would say we're very encouraged by what you've
       been saying, and you're moving in the right direction and we will
       be there to see that you vote correctly," OFA-Illinois Chapter Lead
       Scott Cross [46]told WICS-TV outside Congressman Aaron Schock's
       office in Springfield.
       OFA-FL
       A group of OFA volunteers visited the office of Congressman Daniel
       Webster in Mount Dora, Florida, to thank him for his support and
       ask him to help bring immigration reform to the House floor.
       OFA-WA
       OFA volunteers met with members of Congressman Dave Reichert's
       staff at his office in Issaquah, Washington, to thank the
       congressman for supporting comprehensive immigration reform.
       OFA-WI
       And in Kenosha, Wisconsin, OFA held a lunchtime rally outside of
       Congressman Paul Ryan's office. "He has already said he wants to
       vote on immigration reform," [47]a volunteer told the Kenosha News.
       "We want him to call for a vote. He's been a leader on this issue."
       This is what Action August is all aboutâsupporters are standing up
       for the issues they care about, and lawmakers are listening. Does
       your representative support comprehensive immigration reform?
       [48]Make sure your member of Congress hears your voice this August.
