With Wal-Mart veto, D.C. mayor puts city‚s poor ahead of rally cry for

   Four bus rides to and from his Northeast Washington apartment to the
   Landover Wal-Mart often consumes half of Jimmy Pegues's day. But since
   a heart attack last year pushed the used car salesman into retirement
   and onto Social Security, biweekly trips for $4 generic prescriptions
   have become a lifeline to make ends meet.

   "I come to Wal-Mart -- religiously," said Pegues, 64, who saves $110 a
   month over pharmacies in the District. "For me, at this point, and at
   this time in my life, the price is the most important thing."

     This bill did not represent a choice between low-wage jobs and
     better jobs; it represented a choice between jobs and no jobs.
     -- Vincent C. Gray (@mayorvincegray) [309]September 12, 2013

   Mayor Vincent C. Gray's decision this week to veto a law requiring
   Wal-Mart to offer higher pay pitted support for a "living wage" against
   a desire to spur investment and job growth in the city. But for Pegues
   and thousands like him who cross the city line every day on their way
   to the Landover Wal-Mart, the battle was about something more basic:
   low prices.

   Gray's decision brought focus to the flipside of the living-wage
   debate: that Wal-Mart's customers are often as economically
   disadvantaged as those who scrape by on its hourly wages.

   According to Wal-Mart, District residents in the past 12 months spent
   more than $40 million at the company's stores in suburban Maryland and
   Virginia. The company did not provide information about those shoppers,
   but nationwide, Wal-Mart shoppers typically earn lower-middle-class
   wages, live paycheck-to-paycheck and count jobs and rising food and
   energy costs as their greatest concerns. One-fifth of them have no
   credit and use only cash when they shop, according to company spokesman
   Steven Restivo.

   In the District, the demand for Wal-Mart's prices may be even higher.
   Nearly 24 percent of the city's residents[310]receive food stamps, more
   than anywhere in the nation. A recent study also ranked the District
   with a higher rate of food insecurity than any state except [311]New
   Mexico, with more than 30 percent of children living in households
   without adequate food supply or the resources to keep groceries in
   stock.

   A steady stream of vehicles with District license plates -- on average,
   once a minute -- told the tale on a recent evening at the Wal-Mart in
   Landover. Three miles from the District border, Michelle Smith, an
   unemployed mother of seven from Northeast, loaded a gallon of cooking
   oil and a 10-pound bag of sugar into her sister's car -- a few of $344
   in groceries she needed to stretch for the rest of September.

   Smith's 14-year-old daughter, Nicole, sat sandwiched between a wall of
   64 rolls of toilet paper and a 48-count box of brown sugar Pop-Tarts.
   Food stamps covered $304 of the haul, with boxed and frozen foods
   accounting for most since it would be three to four weeks before
   Smith's sister could bring her back.

   On Thursday, Gray [312]vetoed the so-called Large Retailer
   Accountability Act, which would have required retailers with corporate
   sales of $1 billion or more and operating District stores of at least
   75,000 square feet to pay their employees a "living wage" -- no less
   than $12.50 an hour in combined wages and benefits.
