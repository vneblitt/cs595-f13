TRACES OF TERROR: THE STRATEGY; Bush Aides Set Strategy to Sell Policy on
Iraq

   White House officials said today that the administration was following
   a meticulously planned strategy to persuade the public, the Congress
   and the allies of the need to confront the threat from Saddam Hussein.

   The rollout of the strategy this week, they said, was planned long
   before President Bush's vacation in Texas last month. It was not
   hastily concocted, they insisted, after some prominent Republicans
   began to raise doubts about moving against Mr. Hussein and
   administration officials made contradictory statements about the need
   for weapons inspectors in Iraq.

   The White House decided, they said, that even with the appearance of
   disarray it was still more advantageous to wait until after Labor Day
   to kick off their plan.

   ''From a marketing point of view,'' said Andrew H. Card Jr., the White
   House chief of staff who is coordinating the effort, ''you don't
   introduce new products in August.''

   A centerpiece of the strategy, White House officials said, is to use
   Mr. Bush's speech on Sept. 11 to help move Americans toward support of
   action against Iraq, which could come early next year.

   ''Everybody felt that was a moment that Americans wanted to hear from
   him,'' said Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser. Sept. 11
   will also be a time, Mr. Rove said, ''to seize the moment to make clear
   what lies ahead.''

   Toward that end, in June the White House picked Ellis Island in New
   York Harbor, not Governors Island, as the place where President Bush is
   to deliver his Sept. 11 address to the nation. Both spots were
   considered, White House advisers said, but the television camera angles
   were more spectacular from Ellis Island, where the Statue of Liberty
   will be seen aglow behind Mr. Bush.

   ''We had made a decision that this would be a compelling story either
   place,'' said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director.
   ''We sent a team out to go and look and they said, 'This is a better
   shot,' and we said O.K.''

   In the same way, Mr. Bush's Sept. 11 remarks, about 10 minutes in
   length, are to serve as the emotional precursor for a tougher speech
   about Iraq that the president is to deliver to the United Nations
   General Assembly the following day.

   ''The fact is, there's a pretty abysmal relationship between Saddam
   Hussein and the United Nations,'' said Mr. Bartlett, who added that Mr.
   Hussein had flouted ''everything the U.N. has stood for.''

   ''The president is going to be very direct and articulate a history of
   defiance,'' Mr. Bartlett said.

   Both speeches are in final drafts, although Mr. Bush spent time
   reviewing the United Nations speech on Thursday night on Air Force One
   as he returned to Washington from Indiana. ''He's trimming it up so
   it's in his cadence,'' Mr. Rove said.

   The Sept. 12 speech, a half hour or less in length, was written by a
   team that included Mr. Bush's chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson;
   Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser; Secretary of Defense
   Donald H. Rumsfeld; and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. The Sept.
   11 speech was written by Mr. Gerson and Karen P. Hughes, the former
   counselor who still closely advises Mr. Bush from Texas.

   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, the administration has begun a full-scale
   lobbying campaign. On the day after Labor Day, the opening of
   Washington's political new year, Mr. Bush summoned a skeptical
   Congressional leadership to the White House to enlist their support for
   action against Iraq. The next day two dozen senators from both parties
   were invited to the Pentagon to discuss Iraqi policy with Vice
   President Dick Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld and George J. Tenet, the director
   of central intelligence.
