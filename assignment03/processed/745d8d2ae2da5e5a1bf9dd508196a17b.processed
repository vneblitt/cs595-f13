   Freedom to the Slave

   [119]Historian Eric Foner's talk, in the year of the 150th anniversary
   of the Emancipation Proclamation, will discuss the significance of that
   crucial document, in terms of the Civil War, the place of
   African-Americans in American society, and the evolution of Lincoln's
   own thinking about slavery.  He will examine the causes that led to the
   issuing of the document, and its consequences for Lincoln himself, and
   the broader society.

   [120]Eric Foner, DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia
   University, is one of this country's most prominent historians. He
   received his doctoral degree at Columbia under the supervision of
   Richard Hofstadter. He is one of only two persons to serve as president
   of the three major professional organizations: the [121]Organization of
   American Historians, [122]American Historical Association, and
   [123]Society of American Historians, and one of a handful to have won
   the Bancroft and Pulitzer Prizes in the same year.

   Co-Presented with the [124]Milstein Division of U.S. History, Local
   History and Genealogy
