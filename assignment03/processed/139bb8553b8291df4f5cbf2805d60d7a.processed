New spaces for Harvard Art Museums reflect fresh ideas

   "My message is this is going to be a very different kind of art
   museum," said Harvard Art Museums director Thomas W. Lentz (left), who
   led a tour with Charles Klee, the principal at the architectural firm
   Payette, which is collaborating with the Renzo Piano Building Workshop
   on the renovation and expansion project (photo 1). Among the features
   in Renzo Piano's design is a glass rooftop, a giant skylight that will
   diffuse light down through the building's new central circulation
   corridor, adjacent galleries, and onto the Calderwood Courtyard (photo

   (photo 3).
   By Colleen Walsh, Harvard Staff Writer

   The much-anticipated renewal of the [83]Harvard Art Museums is nearing
   completion, and last week officials offered a sneak peek at the massive
   project's progress.

   Wearing hardhats, protective gloves, safety goggles, and bright yellow
   vests, a small entourage led by museum director Thomas W. Lentz wove
   its way through the beams and boards of the construction site that is
   steadily morphing from a dark hole in the ground and a hollowed
   structural shell to a teaching and learning museum for the 21st
   century.

   "What has driven this entire project is our mission," Lentz said, is
   "innovative teaching and learning," developing new experiences in that
   field for students, faculty, and the community.

   When it opens next year, the new 205,000-square-foot building, which
   unites the Fogg Museum, the Busch-Reisinger Museum, and the Arthur M.
   Sackler Museum under a spectacular glass roof, will include two
   entrances, five floors above ground and three floors below, a café, a
   museum store, an expanded art study center, a 300-seat theater, lecture
   halls, and teaching galleries.

   Function and form hold equal place in the ingenious design by Pritzker
   Prize-winning Italian architect [84]Renzo Piano, who is known for works
   that include the sky-piercing, glass-covered tower called the Shard in
   London and the San Nicola Football Stadium in Bari, Italy, which blooms
   from the landscape like an enormous concrete flower.

   But one function was particularly vital to the Harvard project. For art
   lovers and worried experts alike, the main drawback to the original
   Fogg was its lack of climate controls. "Our internal joke," said Lenz
   as he stood at the bottom of the steps of the 1927 Fogg's original
   Quincy Street entrance, "was we would never lend to ourselves." Now, he
   said, the climate-regulated galleries will be "what a collection of our
   stature really deserves."

   For Lentz, the Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard
   Art Museums, the collection also deserves the chance to be seen -- and
   engaged with -- in innovative ways. Spatial constraints in the old
   facility meant only a fraction of the museum's expansive collection
   could be exhibited. When the renovated and expanded facility opens next
   year, visitors will have 40 percent more gallery space to explore. And
   viewers will be able engage with that material in new ways.

   Standing in a smaller gallery on the dusty third floor, still empty and
   smelling of paint, Lentz explained that the new museum will not offer
   narrowly dedicated galleries for paper, photography, prints, or
   drawings. Instead of consigning such materials to a "paper ghetto,"
   these media will be displayed side-by-side with paintings, sculptures,
   and decorative arts, offering visitors a more "contextual
   presentation."

   The museum also will mingle works provocatively. For instance, American
   works of art will stand alongside European and Native American
   material. "In many ways, that's a reflection of how American art
   history is now taught," said Lentz. "In our view, that's going to make
   for a more compelling presentation. We expect to see lots of
   interesting juxtapositions."

   The galleries will remain small in scale, "human and intimate," said
   Lentz, to encourage viewers to slow down, look, and truly connect with
   artworks. That intimate engagement will be strongly encouraged on the
   fourth floor.

   One level below the museum's Straus Center for Conservation and
   Technical Studies is the art study center, where visitors can request
   up-close viewings of works of art. The center's layout includes three
   study rooms, one each for the Fogg, Busch-Reisinger, and Sackler
   museums, as well as two seminar rooms that can accommodate smaller
   groups of students.

   "The power, we believe, of an art study center," said Lentz, "is it's
   essentially art on demand. What you can have in here is an experience
   that is fundamentally different from walking through the galleries,
   sitting in a classroom, or looking at slides or PowerPoints."

   There will be teaching galleries on the third level, including one that
   will function as a curatorial laboratory where students can study the
   art of installation and how to craft an "argument" by using works of
   art.

   Capping the building's fifth floor is Piano's glass lantern, a shining,
   slanted rooftop fitted with a complex series of mechanical shades that
   allow museum workers to control carefully the amount of light that
   flows into the space. The giant skylight disperses light through the
   conservation lab, study center and what now will be the central
   circulation corridor of the building, diffusing sunshine into the
   galleries and arcades and the beloved old courtyard below, and creating
   what Piano calls the "Light Machine."

   According to Lentz, that courtyard, modeled after a 16th-century façade
   in Montepulciano, Italy, is now truly the emotional and symbolic heart
   of the museum. Previously, the space, which was only open on three
   sides, was "gloomy and static," Lentz recalled. Thanks to Piano and his
   architectural team, the courtyard has been pushed open on all four
   sides and now includes 16 points of entry, along with a bluestone
   floor.

   The ground floor also serves as a pedestrian thoroughfare. The public
   will be able to stroll from the Quincy Street entrance through to a
   new, expanded entrance on Prescott Street, taking advantage of the café
   and store without paying admission. "We wanted to make it much more
   transparent, much more accessible," said Lentz.

   Various flourishes contribute to the museum's visual delights. For
   example, the new wing's wooden façade, when seen up-close, surprises a
   viewer with its grain of rippled waves. The undulating clapboard made
   of Alaska yellow cedar will weather over time to a light gray hue.
   Another welcome and unusual detail can be seen in the museum's winter
   gardens: small niches on the second floor of the new wing that will
   serve as intimate glass sunrooms populated with art that is not
   sensitive to light.

   Throughout the building, a vertical glass window becomes a transparent
   seam allowing visitors to see where the old Fogg structure and the new
   wing merge. Glass-tipped galleries at either end of the first floor
   facing Prescott Street will allow passersby to peek inside. "The
   porosity of this building," said Lentz, "is radically different."

   Ever-conscious of the building's famous neighbor, the [85]Carpenter
   Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard, the only North American
   structure by the renowned modernist architect Le Corbusier, Piano has
   extended that structure's graceful curving concrete ramp along the edge
   of the museum, bringing it under the cantilever of the new wing down to
   Broadway. Charles Klee, the principal at the architectural firm
   [86]Payette, which is collaborating on the project, said Piano likes to
   say, "It's a little bit like Le Corbusier putting his arm around the
   Fogg."

   "A lot of people, when we began this, thought that we were just sort of
   rebuilding a very beautiful, static treasure house," said Lenz. "My
   message is this is going to be a very different kind of art museum ...
   I think the experience for viewers is going to be much more dynamic and
   much more integrated."
