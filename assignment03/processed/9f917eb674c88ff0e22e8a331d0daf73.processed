When it comes to paying for college, career school, or graduate school,
federal student loans offer several advantages over private student loans.

   Need a loan to help pay for college? Consider federal loans first!

Federal Versus Private Loans

   If you apply for financial aid, your school will likely include student
   loans as part of your financial aid package. It's important to
   understand what types of loans you are offered. Generally, there are
   two types of student loans:
     * Federal student loans: These loans are funded by the federal
       government.
     * Private student loans: These loans are nonfederal loans, made by a
       lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or a school.
     __________________________________________________________________

If you need to borrow money to pay for college or career school, start with
federal student loans.

   Federal student loans are:
     * [94]Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans;
     * [95]Direct PLUS Loans (for graduate and professional students or
       parents); and
     * [96]Federal Perkins Loans.
     __________________________________________________________________

What are the differences between federal and private student loans?

   Federal student loans include many benefits (such as fixed interest
   rates and [97]income-based repayment plans) not typically offered with
   private loans. In contrast, private loans are generally more expensive
   than federal student loans.

   The chart below provides a summary of the differences.

                            Federal Student Loans

                            Private Student Loans

   You will not have to start repaying your federal student loans until
   you graduate, leave school, or change your enrollment status to less
   than half-time.

   Many private student loans require payments while you are still in
   school.


   The interest rate is fixed and is often lower than private loans--and
   much lower than some credit card interest rates. View the [98]current
   interest rates on federal student loans.

   Private student loans can have variable interest rates, some greater
   than 18%. A variable rate may substantially increase the total amount
   you repay.

   Undergraduate students with financial need will likely qualify for a
   subsidized loan where the government pays the interest while you are in
   school on at least a half-time basis.

   Private student loans are not subsidized. No one pays the interest on
   your loan but you.


   You don't need to get a credit check for most federal student loans
   (except for PLUS loans). Federal student loans can help you establish a
   good credit record.

   Private student loans may require an established credit record. The
   cost of a private student loan will depend on your credit score and
   other factors.

   You won't need a cosigner to get a federal student loan in most cases.

   You may need a cosigner.


   Interest may be tax deductible.

   Interest may not be tax deductible.

   Loans can be consolidated into a Direct Consolidation Loan.  Learn
   about your [99]consolidation options.


   Private student loans cannot be consolidated into a Direct
   Consolidation Loan.

   If you are having trouble repaying your loan, you may be able to
   temporarily postpone or lower your payments.

   Private student loans may not offer forbearance or deferment options.

   There are several repayment plans, including an option to tie your
   monthly payment to your income.

   You should check with your lender to find out about your repayment
   options.

   There is no prepayment penalty fee.

   You need to make sure there are no prepayment penalty fees.

   You may be eligible to have some portion of your loans forgiven if you
   work in public service. Learn about our [100]loan forgiveness programs.

   It is unlikely that your lender will offer a loan forgiveness program.

   Free help is available at 1-800-4-FED-AID and on our websites.

   The [101]Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's private student loan
   ombudsman may be able to assist you if you have concerns about your
   private student loan.
