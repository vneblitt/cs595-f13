   The Bronx Library Center is pleased to announce its [127]Annual Job
   Expo to be held Wednesday, September 18, 2013 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on
   the Concourse Level of the library.

   The conference rooms will be used for interviewing and the Auditorium
   used for Panel Discussions and Q&A Sessions; this event represents a
   comprehensive approach to address the skills gap and prepare job
   seekers for openings that employers have now. Whether you have been
   helping us support our local community since its inception, or are
   joining us for the first time, you will find that the Bronx Library
   Center's Job Expo is the ideal networking and recruiting event.

   Our Career and Educational Information Services Department (CEIS) has
   organized to connect job seekers with businesses that are hiring or
   plan to hire in the near future. We anticipate that the experience and
   education levels of attendees will be diverse and hope to provide a
   "one-stop" employment shopping experience for employers and potential
   employees alike.

   The Bronx Library Center continues to have a rich tradition of staging
   one of the best job fairs in the Bronx and we hope you will join us for
   the festivities, For further information to make the most of this
   event, please contact: Robyn L. Saunders, Career Coach

[136]This was a joke. A complete

   Submitted by Anonymous on September 18, 2013 at 5:34 PM.

   This was a joke. A complete waste of time. I got there at 11am. Finally
   made it in at about 2 pm. By then most of the companies such as
   BronxWorks and Veterans Affairs were gone. And many of the companies
   advertised to be there such as execusearch and nyu were never even
   there. Montifeor called a quits at around 3pm even though there was a
   long line of jobseekers waiting to be interviewd. Some of the
   recruiters were rude and there were a number of companies such as devry
   and Lehamn college who weren't there to offer jobs but rather there to
   try get your money by enrolling you into a program.

   This was my first job fair ever. And this was my last job fair in The
   Bronx.

   For shame.
