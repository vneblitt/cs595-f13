   Masters of the Latin alternative music radio world Felix Contreras and
   Jasmine Garsd are blowing up the airwaves. The hosts of NPR's
   Alt.Latino talked about blending folk traditions with contemporary
   sounds and who's tuning in.

   What are your musical backgrounds?

   Felix Contreras: My grandparents were from Mexico. And though both of
   my parents were born here, they still listened to lots of Mexican
   music, mostly corridos and mariachi. I was fascinated by that
   early-'90s explosion of bands from Mexico: Maldita Vecindad, Caifanes,
   Cafe Tacuba. That new interpretation of Mexican sensibilities found a
   place in me, and I embraced it completely.

   Jasmine Garsd: I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. My grandfather was
   kind of a player. He'd go dancing in tango clubs until he was well into
   his 70s, while my grandma would stay home and belt out boleros at the
   top of her lungs. As a trained gymnast and dancer, I started out being
   really into pop and dance music; for four to five hours a day, I would
   listen to music with my body, and I think that shows still in my
   musical tastes today. One day when I was a very young kid, I walked
   into a store to buy a pair of black tights, and I heard the Sex Pistols
   for the first time. It was like I had been struck by lightning.

   How and why did you start Alt.Latino?

   Garsd:I was fresh out of college, working as a producer with NPR's Tell
   Me More. There was this dude I'd always run into at the vending
   machine. We'd talk about bands, and we shared a sense of humor; we were
   always cracking each other up. His name was Felix Contreras, and he
   really knew his stuff. More importantly, he shared with me a feeling
   that there needed to be more Latin programming on our airwaves. One day
   I said, "We should tape a podcast." We both started jumping up and down
   in excitement.

   How would you describe the style of music?

   Contreras:A mash-up of Latin folk traditions with contemporary sounds
   like electronica, hip-hop, rock and dance music.

   Garsd:It's quintessentially Latin: A little bit of everythingâstuff
   your parents listened to, stuff you listen toâmashed up.

   If this type of music is characterized by diversity, what unifies it?
   What makes this "a sound" and not just a bunch of songs that happen to
   be made by Latinos?

   Contreras:The unifying sensibility is the rejection of things as they
   have been done in favor of exploring new ways to express yourself with
   a respect for the past. It's very much like the advice given to young
   jazz musicians: "In order to break the rules, you have to know what the
   rules are first."

   How is this music reflective of the world today?

   Contreras:What's called Latin Alternative now is a reflection of a
   pan-Latino sensibilityâthings like mixed marriages (Colombian/Cuban,
   Mexican/Puerto Rican, for example) that are changing the character of
   the Latino demographic. The mashing of cultures is reflected in the
   mash-ups of musical genres. If politicians want to know how this huge
   block of young Latinos thinks, they should listen to this musicâand our
   show!

   Why does Alt.Latino matter?

   Garsd: Alt.Latino matters because Latinos matter, and because we aren't
   getting our due. Latin culture is so varied, so rich. But if you look
   at the media landscape, the little attention we do get tends to be this
   really reductive, simplified, often stereotyped version of Latin
   culture. That is changing, and we're excited to be part of it. We love
   focusing both on what unites us as Hispanics, and what makes us a
   really varied group that is hard to categorize.

   Who is going to have his or her world most rocked by your show?

   Garsd:Probably people who are looking for a more thoughtful, accurate
   representation of Latinos. I have had young people tell me they really
   appreciate the depth of the show and finally feeling like there's a
   voice to represent them. I am also just as thrilled when I hear from a
   retired Jewish lady in the Midwest who doesn't speak Spanish but says
   she loves us.

   Contreras:Given my age, 54, I tend to think of my age group when doing
   our shows. I don't think Latino Baby Boomers believe that anything can
   rock our musical worlds anymore. And I always tell anyone who will
   listen that I have not been this excited about musical discovery since
   1972, when I was discovering jazz, rock, classical music and various
   ethnic musics. I mean, what some of these young Tejanos are doing with
   Flaco Jimenez's music would blow your mind!

   What do you like to do when you listen to this music?

   Garsd:I listen to music when I exercise and when I go dancing. People
   who listen to the show know Felix is more in charge of bringing the
   mellow music to the table.

   Contreras:I like to listen when I work out. But mostly I discover the
   intricacies of the music by tapping along to the beats that I hear. As
   a musician, this is another level of discovery.

   Alt.Latino's artists to watch

   Contreras' picks:

   I am really digging the DJs who are mixing electronica and traditional
   styles:

   â¢ The guys from Texas who do "screwmbia" (chopped and screwed hip-hop
   meets cumbia), Royal Highness.

   â¢ Palenke Soul-Tribe from L.A.

   â¢ Just about everyone on that adventurous Argentine label ZZK Records.

   Garsd's Picks:

   â¢ For proof that Latin hip-hop can be great, give Ana Tijoux and Mala
   Rodriguez a listen. (Two fierce ladies.)

   â¢ Cuban singer Danay Suarez. Think Erykah Badu meets Lauryn Hillâin
   Havana.

   â¢ For feisty rock, Le Butcherettes, an amazing Mexican band.
