   After 15 months of construction, the renewal of Old Quincy -- the
   neo-Georgian portion of Quincy House -- was completed Saturday when it
   was renamed in honor of Robert G. Stone Jr. '45, the late senior fellow
   of the Harvard Corporation, during a ribbon-cutting ceremony held in
   the House's O'Donnell Courtyard.

   The House, which reopened to undergraduates three weeks ago, is the
   first fully renewed building in the effort to re-imagine and
   reconstruct Harvard's undergraduate Houses to support living and
   learning in the 21st century, while also preserving their historic
   character. The building is now fully accessible for those with
   disabilities, is LEED Gold certified as environmentally friendly, and
   includes new social, music, and learning spaces.

   The event's keynote speaker, Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) Dean
   Michael D. Smith, saluted the critical contributions that students,
   faculty, alumni, administrators, architects, and engineers made to the
   project. He also noted the importance of the House renewal project to
   the future of undergraduate life at Harvard.

   "House renewal is predicated on one core belief," said Smith, the John
   H. Finley Jr. Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences in the[83]
   School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). "The Houses are
   among Harvard's most important learning places. They are communities
   where risks are taken, confidence is built, and connections are made
   with peers, faculty, and tutors. The Houses bring Harvard, the research
   University, down to scale, shaping memories and forging friendships
   that last a lifetime."

   Lee Gehrke, master of Quincy House with his wife, Deborah, said it was
   a "momentous and historic day, not only for Quincy House but for all of
   the Harvard Houses and for Harvard College."

   The renewal process has always "been about much more than bricks and
   mortar and physical improvements," said Gehrke. "We can already see
   that the renovations are having a dramatic effect on the student
   experience through improved living spaces and learning spaces and tutor
   advising communities."

   Gehrke, professor of health sciences and technology and microbiology
   and immunobiology at FAS and Harvard Medical School (HMS), listed many
   of the improvements to the building -- ranging from complete
   accessibility to new meeting, social, and art spaces to a new
   innovation room that will facilitate more student-faculty interaction.
   One important change brought a particularly big cheer from the crowd.

   "Walk-through bathrooms," Gehrke declared to enthusiastic applause,
   "are now a thing of the past at Quincy House."

   Stone, who died in 2006 after serving on the Corporation for 27 years,
   also co-chaired two of Harvard's capital campaigns and was known as an
   enthusiastic fundraiser. He had interrupted his Harvard studies to
   serve in the Army during World War II, and returned to captain the
   heavyweight crew that set a record for 2,000 meters in 1947.

   Under warm, late-summer sunshine, the Stone family unveiled a plaque
   with the new name, and ceremonial ribbons were cut in front of each of
   the building's six entryways. The Gehrkes presented members of the
   Stone family with the Quincy Scroll, a framed image of the Quincy
   shield, and welcomed them as honorary members of the Quincy community.

   A host of Stone's family members attended the event, including his
   widow, Marion "Tissa" Stone; his daughter, Jennifer Stone '80, M.D.
   '86; his son, R. Gregg Stone '75, J.D. '79; and his brother, Galen
   Stone '43. Also attending were donors to House renewal, Quincy
   students, faculty members, and administrators from across the College.

   Quincy House committee co-chairs Ginny Fahs '14 and James Wood '14
   relayed to the audience some of the comments they'd heard from students
   living in the renovated space: "Elevators make fourth-floor living so
   much easier. Now, I'm going to have to work out, though," and "Oh God,
   oh God, oh God!  So pretty!"

   Former Dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky read a letter from President
   Drew Faust in which she highlighted the importance of renewal and
   lionized Stone Hall's namesake. Citing his creation of a financial aid
   fund that supported more than 260 undergraduates, Faust hailed Stone's
   devotion to students, as well as his "tenacity, vigor, and generosity."

   "Bob Stone was truly one of a kind:  a sage advisor, tireless
   volunteer, passionate advocate, and committed son of Harvard," Faust
   wrote. "I can think of no better way to honor his memory than for
   future generations of Harvard students to call Stone Hall their home."

   Rosovsky and others remembered Stone as a tall, strong man who enjoyed
   a party and the sea, amusingly combining the two by creating a spigot
   on his boat that dispensed rum. In addition to this "external Bob,"
   Rosovsky noted that there was also an "inner Bob" who "understood and
   upheld Harvard values," including the importance of change.

   "When Bob died in 2006," Rosovsky said, "he probably understood that
   Harvard was, in many ways, a much better place than when he graduated
   in 1945, and he would be justifiably proud of that achievement."

   According to Gregg Stone, while "Harvard College was the cause of his
   [father's] life," the "thrill of fundraising" was not far behind.

   The renewal of Stone Hall was made possible by a gift from James
   Rothenberg '68, M.B.A. '70, and his wife, Anne.

   "Anne and I are grateful for this opportunity to honor Bob Stone, a
   truly extraordinary Harvard citizen. Bob's many contributions to the
   University are legendary. And with the unveiling of Stone Hall, it is
   fitting that his name will now grace one of Harvard's most enduring
   traditions," Rothenberg said in an emailed statement.

   "The House system is the heart of the College experience," he added.
   "We're pleased to be a part of an effort that effectively will
   transform a liberal arts education in the 21st century. Undergraduates
   will experience Harvard as they never have before."

   In their comments, Faust and Smith highlighted the importance of the
   contribution to House renewal and to the University, as well as the
   contributions of other alumni donors.

   At the conclusion of the ceremony, the Gehrkes passed the ceremonial
   torch -- or in this case, hard hat and shovel -- to Howard and Ann
   Georgi, masters of Leverett House, the neo-Georgian portion of which is
   currently under reconstruction.

   Construction on Stone Hall, the first House renewal test project, began
   in June, 2012.  The neo-Georgian portion of Leverett House -- which,
   unlike Stone Hall, includes public spaces such as the master's
   residence and the dining hall --is in the process of being renewed, and
   is expected to reopen next August.

   Stone Hall and Leverett's McKinlock Hall were designed as test projects
   through which architects and administrators could assess design,
   construction, and financing concepts, before attempting to renew a full
   House.

   "Through the Old Quincy test project, we have learned an enormous
   amount," Smith said. "But we are not done learning. We will learn even
   more from the students who now live here. We will put those lessons to
   good use in our next projects: Leverett-McKinlock and our first full
   House project in Dunster."

   Dunster is the first full House scheduled for renewal, beginning next
   June. During construction, students from affected Houses live in nearby
   swing space that, beginning next year, will be centered on the building
   that formerly housed the Inn at Harvard.
