Boston airport's 9/11 training drill leads to quick apology

   September 11, 2013|Reuters

   BOSTON (Reuters) - A training drill at Boston's Logan International
   Airport involving fire crews on an airport tarmac on Wednesday - the
   12th anniversary of the September 11 attacks - drew quick criticism and
   prompted an apology from airport officials.

   "Safety and security is our top priority and constant vigilance and
   readiness is critical, but the exercise should not have taken place on
   the anniversary of 9/11," the airport said in a statement on Wednesday.

   Airport officials had warned the public that the exercise, which
   involved emergency response personnel, would be held on the airfield
   and smoke would be visible. It did not interfere with flight
   operations, but the move drew criticism on the airport's Facebook page.

   Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick also criticized the decision to
   hold the exercise on the anniversary of the attacks, when two hijacked
   airliners destroyed the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New
   York, one damaged the Pentagon and one crashed in a field in
   Pennsylvania.

   Almost 3,000 people died in the attacks. Two of the jets had taken off
   from Boston.

   "It's just dumb," Patrick told reporters when asked about the timing of
   the event, according to local media. "The timing could not have been
   worse."
