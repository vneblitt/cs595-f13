Congressman John Lewis to Open ‚A Day Like No Other‚ March on Washington
Photo Exhibition, Aug. 28

Library to Present Additional One-Day Display of Treasured Holdings from
March

   U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who was a young civil-rights leader in 1963, will
   open the photo exhibition "A Day Like No Other: Commemorating the 50th
   Anniversary of the March on Washington" at the Library of Congress on
   Aug. 28.

   The Library will present an additional one-day display of treasured
   documents and materials related to the March on Washington, including a
   copy of Martin Luther King Jr.‚s "I Have a Dream" speech submitted for
   copyright registration on Oct. 2, 1963.

   Lewis will speak at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 28 in the Great Hall on
   the first floor of the Thomas Jefferson Building, 10 First St. S.E.,
   Washington, D.C. The event is free and open to the public. Tickets and
   reservations are not needed.

   The display, which is also free and open to the public, will be on view
   from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 28 in the Coolidge Auditorium
   Foyer and in the Whittall Pavilion on the ground level of the Thomas
   Jefferson Building, 10 First St. S.E., Washington, D.C.

   The Library‚s photo exhibition "A Day Like No Other" features 40
   black-and-white photographs from newspaper and other media
   photographers, independent photojournalists and people who participated
   in the march on Aug. 28, 1963. The images represent the cross-section
   of individuals who attended the largest nonviolent demonstration for
   civil rights that America had ever witnessed. The exhibit conveys the
   immediacy of being at the march and the palpable excitement of those
   who were there. A video screen in the exhibit will show an additional
   58 photos.

   The photo exhibition is located in the Graphic Arts Galleries on the
   ground level of the Jefferson Building. It is free and open to the
   public from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and will
   run through March 1, 2014.

   The one-day display will draw from materials in the following divisions
   of the Library: Manuscript; Prints and Photographs; Music; Serial and
   Government Publications; and Motion Picture, Broadcast and Recorded
   Sound, as well as the American Folklife Center and the Law Library.
   Curators from the divisions will be present to discuss the items with
   visitors.

   In addition to the "I Have a Dream" speech, highlights from the one-day
   display include:
     * Two versions of the speech at the march by John Lewis,
       then-chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
       (SNCC): the original, prior to editing, and the one he presented.
     * Chief organizer Bayard Rustin‚s original planning notes for the
       march.
     * March director A. Philip Randolph‚s letter to President John F.
       Kennedy requesting a meeting "to discuss the program of the march
       and plans for implementation by your administration and Congress."
     * Thurgood Marshall‚s "Saving the Race" memorandum to the NAACP legal
       staff.
     * Draft legislation for the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts.
     * Sound recordings, lyrics and sheet music related to the march.
     * Retrospective video interviews with march participants drawn from
       the Civil Rights History project that is coordinated by the
       American Folklife Center.
     * ABC‚s complete television coverage of the march, including the
       major speeches, interviews with participants and observers, and
       commentary.

   Also at the display, in a comment book, visitors will have the
   opportunity to note their recollections of the march and what it means
   today.

   Additionally on Aug. 28, there will be a panel discussion on "The
   Bayard Rustin Papers" from noon to 1 p.m. in Dining Room A on the sixth
   floor of the James Madison Memorial Building, 101 Independence Ave.
   S.E., Washington, D.C. The panel will provide insight into the life of
   Rustin, civil-rights leader and chief organizer for the March on
   Washington, as shown through the Bayard Rustin Papers. The papers, held
   in the Library‚s Manuscript Division, illuminate the man and his
   mission of equality. The event is free and open to the public.

   The panel will be moderated by Sharon J. Lettman-Hicks, executive
   director and chief executive officer of the National Black Justice
   Coalition. Members of the panel will be Library of Congress employees
   Adrienne Cannon, John Ashley, Luis Clavell and Brock Thompson.

   In conjunction with the photo exhibition "A Day Like No Other,"
   curators Maricia Battle and Verna Curtis will offer a tour and discuss
   the images at noon on Wednesday, Sept. 4, in the Graphic Arts
   Galleries.

   "A Day Like No Other" and its programming were made possible by the
   generous support of the J.J. Medveckis Foundation, the Friends of the
   Law Library of Congress, the Law Library Various Donors Gift Fund,
   Roberta I. Shaffer, and an anonymous donor to the Prints and
   Photographs Division.
