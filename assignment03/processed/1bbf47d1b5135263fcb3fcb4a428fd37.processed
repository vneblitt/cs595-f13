Words Like Sapphires: 100 Years of Hebraica at the Library of Congress,
1912â2012

   October 25, 2012âApril 13, 2013

   The Hebraic Section of the Library of Congress is recognized as one of
   the worldâs foremost centers for the study of Hebrew and Yiddish
   materials. Its beginnings can be traced to Jacob H. Schiffâs gift in
   1912 of nearly 10,000 books and pamphlets. In the century since
   Schiffâs initial gift, the Library has expanded its Hebraic holdings to
   close to 200,000 works in Hebrew and related languages.

The People of the Book ×¢× ××¡×¤×¨

   The Jewish people have long been known as the âPeople of the Book.â The
   book in question being the Bible, and the term a deceptively simpleâbut
   ultimately profoundâacknowledgement of the centrality of the Bible in
   the Jewish religion. [31]Read more about The People of the Book ×¢×

Cornerstones of Jewish Religious Life ××× × ××¡××

   The âPeople of the Bookâ were, in fact, a people with many books, and
   these served as cornerstones of Jewish life through the ages. The Bible
   contains the Written Law, but an Oral Law, handed down from generation
   to generation, existed alongside it, most noticeably in the set of
   books known collectively as the âTalmud.â [37]Read more about

Gates of Prayer ×©×¢×¨× ×ª×¤×××

   Prayer is as central to Judaism as it is varied and multi-faceted, and
   through the ages the âGates of Prayerâ have opened to a tremendous
   surge of literary creativity. The earliest Hebrew prayers are found in
   the Bible, where they range from a few heart-felt words spoken by Moses
   (Numbers 12:13) or Hannah (Samuel 1:11) to the lyric outpourings in the
   Psalms. [43]Read more about Gates of Prayer ×©×¢×¨× ×ª×¤××× »

Holy Land/Holy Tongue ××©×× ××§×××© ××¨×¥ ××§×××©

   Hebrew and the Land of Israelâthe holy tongue and the holy landâhave
   been intimately bound together in Jewish sources since the earliest
   times. The bond was forged in the Bible by prophets and lawgivers,
   kings and scribes, and it created a single, insoluble entity. [49]Read

Beauty in Holiness ××××¨ ××¦××

   Hidur mitzvah, or the beautification of objects pertaining to Jewish
   religious observance, has a long and varied tradition harking back to
   the Bible. The Book of Exodus recounts that the artisan Bezalel ben Hur
   fashioned the Ark of the Covenant and its implements with lavish
   ornamentation and beauty. [55]Read more about Beauty in Holiness ××××¨

The Power of the Tongue ××× ×××©××

   Hebrew is often called the âholy tongueâ because it is the language of
   the Hebrew Bible, most synagogue worship, and, according to ancient
   tradition, Creation itself. It is also the language of daily life in
   the modern State of Israel, largely because of the efforts of
   pioneering figures who led the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language
   in the early twentieth century. [61]Read more about The Power of the

A New Song ×©××¨× ×××©×

   âBy the rivers of Babylon,â as told in Psalm 137, the Jewish exiles
   from the Holy Land, led into captivity after the destruction of the
   Temple in Jerusalem, hung their harps upon the willows, lamenting âHow
   shall we sing the Lordâs song in a foreign land?â Yet sing they did:
   the annals of subsequent Jewish history are studded with songs and
   poems regarded as classics of Hebrew literature. [67]Read more about A
