Two Sumatran Tiger Cubs Born

   Sumatran tiger Damai gave birth to two Sumatran tiger cubs on Monday
   evening, August 5, 2013! These cubs are a conservation success.
   Sumatran tigers are critically endangered in the wild, so every cub
   counts.

   Damai gave birth to the first cub around 6:15 p.m. and the second
   around 8:23 p.m. Keepers have been monitoring the cubs and both appear
   healthy. Damai is being a great mom, and is nursing and grooming both
   cubs.

   We are giving Damai time to bond with and care for her cubs. They most
   likely will not be on exhibit until late fall. In the meantime, you can
   watch them grow on the Zoo's tiger cub cams!

September 13

   Damai brings the cubs up to see Kavi most mornings now. Traveling
   around the building is a great way to develop their strength and
   coordination. We are even starting to see the cubs playing together.
   They are not very good at pouncing on each other yet, but it's a lot of
   fun to watch them try! They are growing very quickly and the boy is a
   tad under 14 pounds while his sister almost 12 pounds. They are still
   getting all their nourishment from their mothers' milk and that will
   probably not change for at least another month.

September 7

   The tiger cubs continue to thrive and are steadily gaining weight.
   Their coordination is improving as well, and they are exploring all
   five of the rooms that are available to them. The little girl came out
   into the runway yesterday afternoon and saw her mother Damai engage in
   a training session with one of her keepers. Damai has shown signs of
   wanting to bring the cubs up to the mesh door to show them to Kavi.
   This is normal tiger behavior that we have been expecting. There is no
   webcam in this area, but we will try to get some video to show everyone
   when the cubs see their dad for the first time.

September 5: Cubs are one month old

   The tiger cubs are one month old today. And Damai has moved them back
   into a den on the tiger cam!
   tiger cubs!

August 26, 2013: First Vet Exam

   Our tiger cubs are 3 weeks old, and this morning they got their first
   veterinary exam--and passed with roaring colors. Veterinarians
   determined that the 2 cubs are a male and a female. The male cub weighs
   a little more than 8 pounds and the female weighs 7.5 pounds. During
   the exam the cubs received transponder microchips, and veterinarians
   collected blood and fecal samples from them. Veterinarians and keepers
   report the cubs are healthy, plump and growing quickly.

   The cubs will not be on exhibit for several months until they have
   completed a series of four additional health exams, during which they
   will receive all necessary vaccinations.

   Look at these pictures of the cubs the keepers got this week. The
   keepers can already tell which markings they'll use to tell the cubs
   apart.Can you find one or two distinctive markings to distinguish one
   from the other?

   While Damai was enjoying a break from the cubs this morning, our
   keepers were able to continue desensitization training with them. And
   they were able to take some photos of them! The training is going well
   and will help get the cubs used to the keepers' smell and presence.

   As you may have noticed, Damai and the cubs aren't on the cams at the
   moment. When she was pregnant, she had access to three possible cubbing
   dens, two of which had cams. Animal care staff did their best to make
   the two dens with cams as inviting as possible, to encourage her to
   stay there when she had her cubs.

   Today, though, we opened up two other dens for her, which are farther
   back in the lion/tiger house as well as being a little darker. These
   are also the dens she was in for her quarantine period when she first
   arrived at the Zoo. She didn't move the cubs back there right away, but
   this afternoon she did choose to move the cubs back there.

   Since she didn't move the cubs as soon as she was given the option, we
   do not think that her moving the cubs had anything to do with our
   keepers' sitting with the cubs as part of their desensitization
   training. If Damai had been upset about smelling the keepers on the
   cubs or the dens, she would have moved the cubs as soon as she had the
   chance. Since she waited, we think it's likely that she simply prefers
   those two dens as being slightly more comfortable, familiar, or
   protected-feeling.

   Damai always has the option of moving the cubs back to the dens with
   the cameras, but we want that decision to be hers. Animal care is our
   first priority. We can't move the cams back to the den where she and
   the cubs are now. For the meantime, we promise to keep you updated with
   news and photos as soon as possible, and we'll be sure to let you know
   when and if she and the cubs move back to one of the dens with the live
   cams.

August 8, 2013

   Damai came out of her den on Tuesday while keepers were in the Great
   Cats building, which is a good sign! That means she is comfortable with
   the keepers being near her cubbing den. While she was out she appeared
   very calm and stayed out for quite a while. She ate all of the meat
   keepers had offered her, and did not seem overly concerned about the
   cubs.

   Eventually she made her way back into the den, and when she got there
   she didn't move the cubs. That tells keepers that she didn't feel
   anxious or threatened by their presence.

   First time mom Damai is a natural with her two newborn cubs. The
   Sumatran tiger cubs' eyes have not opened yet, so Damai is spending
   most of her time grooming and nursing them. Damai lets the cubs crawl
   all over her, as if her body is a jungle gym.

   Damai is spending almost all of her time with her new cubs and who
   could blame her, they're adorable! Bonding time is critical for mom and
   her cubs, so for a few weeks they will be off of exhibit spending time
   together. In the meantime, visit the cubs' dad, Kavi, at the Great Cats
   Exhibit.

   Not only are our two new Sumatran tiger cubs the cutest cubs in town
   but they are also a huge conservation success. With fewer than 500
   Sumatran tigers in the wild, the birth of these cubs makes a stride in
   the direction towards saving this critically endangered species.

   "It's taken more than two years of perseverance getting to know Damai
   and Kavi and letting them get to know each other so that we could reach
   this celebratory moment," said Craig Saffoe. "All I can do is smile
   because the team has realized our goal of producing critically
   endangered tiger cubs. Damai came to us as a young tiger herself, so
   it's really special to see her become a great mom."

   Keepers and veterinarians began monitoring Damai closely in June after
   she began gaining weight and exhibiting behaviors that indicated she
   could be pregnant. Staff trained Damai to participate in ultrasound
   procedures, which allowed them to confirm her pregnancy on June 21,
   2013. Keepers prepared for the arrival of cubs after Damai became
   restless and began showing signs that she would soon give birth. This
   is Damai's first litter of cubs, sired by the Zoo's 12-year-old male
   tiger, Kavi. The two bred several times from December 2012 through
   mid-April of 2013.

   Damai and tiger cubs on cam

   Tiger fans may be able to watch the newborn tiger cubs at the National
   Zoo reach every milestone for the next several weeks via live webcams
   on the Zoo's website. Damai has the choice of moving her cubs to dens
   in the indoor tiger enclosure that do not have webcams. If she chooses
   to move them, they may not be visible on the webcam. Viewers can toggle
   between two webcams in the cubbing dens. During the next few weeks the
   cubs will open their eyes, become more mobile and potentially even
   start to explore the other dens that Damai can access.

   The Zoo will provide updates on the cubs on [111]Facebook and
   [112]Twitter.
