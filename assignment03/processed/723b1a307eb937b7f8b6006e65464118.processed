UN missions in Africa making progress on new challenges, says UN peacekeeping
chief

   12 September 2013 - The head of United Nations peacekeeping operations
   today highlighted the important progress being made since the beginning
   of the year on tackling major challenges in the Democratic Republic of
   the Congo (DRC), Mali, Sudan and South Sudan.

   Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Hervé Ladsous
   opened a press briefing at Headquarters with comments on the DRC where
   he said national forces (FARDC), with support from the UN peacekeeping
   mission MONUSCO and its intervention brigade, were able to push the M23
   rebel group towards the north so it no longer presented a direct threat
   to the city of Goma, in the vast country's eastern region, the
   surrounding camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) or on the
   mission's positions.

   "The M23 has suffered casualties and that is the reason why they pushed
   back to, presumably, lick their wounds," Mr. Ladsous said. "MONUSCO has
   firmly strengthened its positions to be in a better position to defend
   Goma and all the population in and around the area."

   He stressed, however, that the underlying causes of the conflict in the
   country, and the Great Lakes overall, necessitates a political
   solution.

   Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to the Great Lakes Region, Mary
   Robinson, and Martin Kobler, the Secretary-General's Special
   Representative in the DRC and head of MONSUCO, spent about a week in
   the region earlier this month to participate in the so-called Kampala
   talks which have led to a resumption of talks between the M23 and the
   Government.

   Joined by their counterparts from the African Union, European Union and
   the United States, the UN envoys also stressed the urgency of steps
   forward in the implementation of the 11-nation Peace, Security and
   Cooperation Framework signed earlier this year under UN auspices.

   Mr. Ladsous also highlighted that the UN, through MONUSCO, is now a
   full fledged member of the Expanded Joint Verification Mechanism
   (EJVM), a technical body, comprising experts from both DRC and Rwanda
   and those of the UN and African Union (AU), to address DRC-Rwanda
   border security issues.

   "I think we will be able to get a much clearer picture of what is
   happening," the UN peacekeeping chief said in reference to accusations
   of shellings across the border.

   He also noted that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would be used for
   observation purposes over the Kivus by the end of the year.

   The progress being made in the DRC is due to be discussed at a special
   event on the sidelines of the high-level opening of the General
   Assembly on 23 September in New York, Mr. Ladsous said.

   Turning to Mali, he said the phrase remains "so far, so good".

   "We remain more than ever in full support of the efforts the Government
   of Mali has announced whilst we are strengthening MINUSMA," Mr. Ladsous
   said using the acronym for the UN Multidimensional Integrated
   Stabilization Mission in the country.

   The Mission is currently at a strength of 5,201 soldiers on the ground
   plus a little over 800 police officers with additional contingents due
   to arrive from Asia, other parts of Africa and Latin America, he said.

   Mr. Ladsous said the process of addressing the root causes of the
   conflict are a "continuous effort but one that so far looks promising."
   He noted however that this is only one stage in a stabilization process
   in a country that since early 2012, has witnessed a military coup
   d'état, renewed fighting between Government forces and Tuareg rebels,
   and the seizure of its northern territory by radical Islamists.

   In addition to the events in Mali, Mr. Ladsous stressed the need to
   take into account the entire Sahel region which stretches from
   Mauritania to Eritrea, including Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger,
   Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan.

   This regional perspective is also due to be discussed at a side event
   on the margins of the General Assembly, he noted.

   Mr. Ladsous said the situation in Sudan and South Sudan is a "yo-yo, at
   one stage things get better but get worse again." Events are currently
   in a positive phase following a successful meeting last week between
   Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and President Salva Kiir of South
   Sudan.

   "We hope that the border mechanism will contribute towards less tension
   in that border area," Mr. Ladsous said, noting the importance of the
   two countries to work together constructively on the contentious topic
   of the future of the status of the territory of Abyei.

   Declining to say too much on Syria, Mr. Ladsous responded to a question
   about a possible peacekeeping force in the country, saying that the
   matter is "completely in the hands of the Security Council."

   "A number of ideas have been mentioned but I have no sense that there
   is a decision forthcoming," the UN peacekeeping chief said. "We are
   under orders of the Council and if we are requested to do something, we
   shall act accordingly."

   In addition, Mr. Ladsous mentioned the UN force in Golan Heights
   ([72]UNDOF) which continues to be strengthened to full authorized
   levels. Ireland has announced the deployment of a contingent to join
   UNDOF, due to arrive this month.

   In southern Lebanon, the situation remains "quiet", Mr. Ladsous said,
   adding that the UN force there ([73]UNIFIL) has "taken steps to have
   the greatest awareness as possible and adjusting their posture
   accordingly."
