   [icon_pdf.gif] [125]Overview of the new Elephant Community Center


Elephant Trails

   Elephant Trails spans 8,943 square meters, which is large enough to
   accommodate up to three separate groups of elephants, including a
   natural, matriarchal herd of elephants and individual bulls.
   Altogether, the facility can house between eight and ten adult Asian
   elephants and their young.

Fast Facts

Size

   Elephant Trails spans 8,943 square meters total. The indoor exhibit is
   1,232 square meters; the outdoor exhibit is 7,711 square meters.

Features

   The Zoo's goal is to provide all elephants with indoor-outdoor access
   year round. The Elephant Community Center and Elephant Barn contain
   nine indoor living areas, or "suites." The outdoor component of
   Elephant Trails contains seven enclosures, including four exhibit
   yards, two paddocks, and an Elephant Trek. Sliding doors separate each
   area and can be opened for full access or closed for isolation of
   individuals or groups. By enabling or restricting access, keepers vary
   the level of visual and tactile access among the Zoo's elephants.

   To help ensure the Zoo's elephants have healthy feet and nails, the Zoo
   uses a mix of substrates. The indoor facility's flooring can be heated
   and is composed of two substrates: rubber flooring and sand.
     * In the Elephant Barn, four suites contain rubber flooring; one
       suite is comprised of sand flooring that is 1.2 meters deep and
       sits atop a heated concrete slab
     * In the elephant Community Center, all suites are comprised of sand
       flooring that is 1.2 meters deep and sits atop a heated concrete
       slab

   The outdoor yards are composed of a mixture containing dirt, sand, and
   grass. The shift area flooring is made of broom-finished concrete, and
   the Elephant Exercise Trek is made of pavement.

Elephant Community Center

   The Elephant Community Center is an indoor exhibit located on Olmsted
   Walk, adjacent to Parking Lot B. It highlights the first-class animal
   husbandry and medical care that the Zoo's elephants receive, as well as
   Smithsonian elephant research--both at the Zoo and in native habitats.
   This facility:
     * Features state-of-the-art animal care facilities. The Elephant
       Community Center provides the Zoo's elephants with ample space for
       socializing, training, and playing.
     * Maximizes elephant comfort through climate control and sand
       flooring that is 1.2 meters deep.
     * Contains an elephant wading pool with a shower that can be
       activated by elephants and/or keepers.
     * Allows Zoo visitors the opportunity to get an up-close view of
       these incredible animals and learn about zoo care, elephant
       physiology, cognition and social behaviors.
     * Is built within the walls of the Zoo's historic elephant building.
     * Is a green building. It was designed to LEED standards for
       sustainability and environmentally friendly design. [127]More about
       the LEED certification of Elephant Trails.

   Elephant Community Center visitors will experience the sights, sounds
   and smells of being close to the Zoo's Asian elephants. In addition,
   interactive exhibits will teach visitors about elephants' physical
   characteristics, social behaviors, intelligence, and the commitment it
   takes to care for the Zoo's elephants. Exhibits include:
     * Timeline: Elephants at the National Zoo
       This timeline begins with Congress creating the National Zoological
       Park in 1889 and highlights the Zoo's major elephant conservation
       milestones through present day.
     * What is an Asian Elephant?
       Visitors explore and learn about the physical features of Asian
       elephants by manipulating panels to touch replicas (such as skin
       and hair) and discover facts about elephants' trunks, teeth, ears,
       skin, and feet.
     * Extreme Elephants
       This exhibit allows visitors to quantify the extreme lives of
       elephants. How big are they? How much do they drink? What can they
       lift?
     * Epic Elephant Stories
       This series of interactive video and audio exhibits highlights the
       physical and mental capabilities of elephants. Topics include: Bull
       behavior, matriarchal social structure, elephant cognition, and
       vocalizations.
     * Photo Booth and Elephant Pledge
       This fun photo booth allows visitors to make a pledge to help save
       elephants and take an instant photo with family and friends.

Elephant Barn

   The Elephant Barn, which is next to the Elephant Community Center,
   provides more than 5,700 square feet of livable space for the Zoo's
   herd of Asian elephants. It is not open to the public except through
   the Zoo's Elephant Barn Tours program. Features include:
     * Green building design features, including: geothermal heating;
       water filtration; recycling capabilities; green roof; energy
       efficient climate control; and operable skylights.
     * Five `suite' enclosures that can accommodate individual and
       multiple elephants.
     * A `training wall' that allows keepers safe access to the elephants
       for training and medical procedures.
     * A transfer hallway that allows for movement within and between the
       Elephant Barn and Elephant Community Center.
     * An Elephant Restraint Device (ERD) that is used to weigh elephants
       and keep them secure during training and medical procedures.
     * A hoist beam over each suite that is capable of lifting up to
       12,000 pounds. The hoists also allow keepers to hang enrichment
       items to encourage the elephants' natural behaviors.
     * An elevated mezzanine walkway for monitoring and studying elephant
       behavior.
     * An on-site storage and food preparation area. Browse (vegetation
       such as shoots and leaves that are suitable for animals to eat) is
       stored in a climate-controlled space where misters keep it fresh
       until it is given to the animals.
     * Offices and workspace for the curator and elephant keeper staff.

   Outdoor Yards

Outdoor Yards

   Diverse outdoor habitats contain features such as pools and sand piles
   that stimulate natural elephant behavior.The outdoor yards provide more
   than two acres of varied terrain, elevations and opportunities for the
   elephants to explore. The four exhibit yards allow for optimal herd
   management and provide space for the elephant to exercise, forage, and
   socialize. Features include:
     * Four spacious outdoor animal living spacesand two paddocks.
     * Structures that provide sun protection in the summer and heat in
       cool weather.
     * Filtered bathing pools that include water sprays in the warmer
       months.
     * Enrichment objects such as scratch trees, tractor tires and boomer
       balls.

   Elephant Outpost

Elephant Outpost

   Featuring dramatic views of the Elephant Trek, a large habitat complete
   with a pool, and educational components, the Homer and Martha Gudelsky
   Elephant Outpost is inspired by Smithsonian research projects
   throughout Asia. Field research plays a critical role in ongoing
   efforts to preserve wild Asian elephant populations and their habitats.
   Interactive exhibits ask visitors to play the role of scientists and
   determine what challenges Asian elephants face. Features include:
     * Elephant Trek
       Unique to the National Zoo, the Elephant Trek provides invigorating
       outdoor exercise experiences for the Zoos elephants that simulates
       the type of elevated terrain found in range countries. The fenced
       quarter-mile walking path then winds its way up through the wooded
       vegetation. Visitors can view elephants on the trek from the
       Outpost and from the Bird House circle.
     * Tracking Asian Elephants
       Learn why National Zoo researchers track elephants and what their
       work means for elephant conservation in range countries. Three
       different animations, based on real Smithsonian research projects,
       show elephant movement in Sri Lanka.
     * Tracking Tools
       See authentic tools and equipment used to track Asian elephants.
       Featured equipment includes a four-foot-wide tracking collar, radio
       tracking antenna, dart gun and darts, camera traps and G.P.S
       transponders.
     * African and Asian Elephant Comparison
       A side-by-side interactive display illustrates the physiological
       differences between African and Asian elephants and helps visitors
       distinguish them as two distinct species.
     * The Science of Poop Exhibit Table
       Elephant poop is so much more than waste: its scientific gold. This
       exhibit table shows the many uses for poop in the lab and in the
       field. Visitors can spin a centrifuge, run hormone tests and learn
       what scientists can learn just from elephant poop.
     * Elephant Clues Exhibit Table
       Solve mysteries by studying the clues elephant herds leave behind.
       Measure elephant footprints to learn an animal's height, examine
       elephant bones and poop, and learn what camera traps can tell us
       about where and how elephants live.
     * Elephant Labyrinth Game
       Players help move an elephant, represented as a ball, safely home
       to its herd. While traveling between patches of forest habitat they
       must avoid dangers such as villages, railroads, palm oil
       plantations and poaches.
     * Range Map
       The 17-foot range map shows the dramatic reeducation in Asian
       elephant habitat over the past 100 years.
     * Elephant Portraits
       Life-sized portraits of Asian Elephants allow visitors to see Asian
       elephants' wrinkles, hair and skin texture.
     * Donation Station
       After learning about Asian elephants and being inspired by the
       Zoo's living collection, visitors can become active participants in
       elephant conservation by donating.
     * Outpost Shop and Snacks
       During warm weather months the Outpost kiosk provides refreshments
       and elephant-themed gifts. Some of the merchandise includes artisan
       items from Asian elephant range countries and eco-friendly elephant
       related products.
     * Restrooms
       The Outpost restrooms feature light-hearted information and
       graphics that highlight fun facts about elephant bodily functions.
     * Elephant Footprints
       Life-sized painted elephant footprints (based on the actual foot
       size and stride of Ambika) lead visitors down the Outpost Path.
     * Willow Elephant Sculptures
       Sculptor Steve Manning wove willow branches to create the
       life-sized mother and bull elephant sculptures at the entrance and
       exit of the Elephant Outpost Path out of woven willow branches.
