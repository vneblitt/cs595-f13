What Trader Joe's teaches us about Obamacare

   Welcome to Health Reform Watch, Sarah Kliffâs regular look at how the
   Affordable Care Act is changing the American health-care system â and
   being changed by it. You can reach Sarah with questions, comments and
   suggestionsÂ [349]here. Check back every Monday, Wednesday and Friday
   afternoon for the latest edition, and read previous columnsÂ [350]here.

   Days until marketplaces launch: 18.
   [351]In this July 26, 2013 photo, grocery bags filled with Trader Joe's
   products purchased in the U.S. the night before wait to be stocked on
   shelves at Pirate Joe's market in Vancouver, B.C. Mike Hallatt opened
   the shop, which resells Trader Joe's products, in 2012 and is now being
   sued by California-based Trader Joe's. Hallatt makes frequent trips to
   the United States to stock up on product during shopping sprees at
   Trader Joe's despite having his photo posted at most locations in
   Washington state. (AP Photo/San Francisco Chronicle, Paul Chinn)

   Â (Paul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle via AP)

   Trader Joe's made a very big announcement this week, one that had
   nothing to do with Two-Buck Chuck.

   The grocery chain, in [352]a memo obtained by the Huffington Post, told
   part-time employees that it would end their health insurance benefits
   for employees who work less than 30 hours a week, sending them instead
   to the new public insurance marketplaces with an extra $500 to help
   purchase coverage.

   âDepending on income earned outside of Trader Joeâs, we believe that
   with the $500 from Trader Joeâs and the tax credits available under the
   ACA, many crew members should be able to obtain health-care coverage at
   very little, if any, net cost,â the company said Thursday in a
   statement to Bloomberg.

   So what does this decision by Trader Joe's tell us about the Affordable
   Care Act? A few things.

   Before we get to that, though, its worth thinking about why Trader
   Joe's â or any employer â offers health insurance right now.

   While health benefits are expensive, companies typically offer them to
   stay competitive. A robust health plan can go a long way in wooing
   potential employees â especially when most of the market doesn't offer
   part-time workers the opportunity to buy coverage.

   A healthier workforce can also have a benefit to a company, if they
   have fewer workers taking sick days and increasing productivity. The
   tax code gives companies yet another reason to offer benefits:
   Companies can pay for health insurance with pre-tax dollars, making
   compensation in the form of these benefits a better deal than the
   post-tax salaries they pay.

   These incentives pre-dated the Affordable Care Act and they will
   outlast the law, too. The health-care law does add in a whole bunch
   ofÂ otherÂ incentives, which could change how employers think about the
   benefits they offer workers. It requires employers to provide health
   insurance to all full-time workers if they employ more than 50 people.
   That increases the incentive to provide coverage.

   There are forces working in the opposite direction, too, that decrease
   employers' incentives to provide health coverage. The health law will
   eliminate pre-existing conditions, meaning that anyone who does lose
   coverage will have an option elsewhere, which is not the case today. It
   also provides subsidies for purchasing private insurance or, for
   lower-income workers, the opportunity to enroll in Medicaid.

   The insurance market under Obamacare, in other words, is supposed to be
   a friendlier one than what exists right now. And that's what Trader
   Joe's seems to be betting on with its move: that its workers will see
   similar options without the grocery store footing the full bill.

   Whether this will be true is hard to game out at this point. The
   Huffington Post did talk to one Trader Joe's worker who estimated that
   she earned about $20,000 and currently pays $70 a month for a pretty
   robust health plan. Trader Joe's plans to kick in $500 for each
   employee, or about $40 per month. So we're looking at a total of $110
   to spend on the marketplace each month, if spending holds to the same
   level as what Trader Joe's workers pay right now.

   The rate data we have so far (largely from the Kaiser Family
   Foundation) suggest Â that comparable premiums will be available for
   someone earning $20,000. Using a calculator that Kaiser helped build,
   it shows that a 25-year-old who makes that much here in the District
   would pay $85 for a middle-of-the-road plan and $26 for the bare-bones
   option. Premiums are a bit higher for those who are older, and a little
   lower for younger subscribers.

   As for what Trader Joe's decision means for the health-care law, that's
   not totally clear either. On the one hand, it likely makes the health
   law more expensive: Trader Joe's is essentially shifting the costs it
   used to pay for health insurance onto the federal government. On the
   other, bigger marketplaces are good for the health law. More
   subscribers make it more likely that insurers will want to sell and, if
   Trader Joes' employees tend to be younger, they'll likely help hold
   down the cost of premiums there.

   KLIFF NOTES: Top health policy reads from around the Web.Â

   Texas is still in the dark on Obamacare.Â "Randy Osbanâs job selling
   ribs and brisket from a yellow trailer onÂ Texasâs State Road 71 offers
   a sweeping view of the hill country beyond Austin. One benefit his
   business doesnât provide is health insurance.Â Osban, 55, could use it
   now, as his wife Kathy, 59, has a heart condition and the money he
   makes barely covers current expenses, much less a hospital bill. While
   heâs heard ofÂ Obamacare, he doesnât know if it can help him or how to
   enroll."Â [354]Alex Wayne for Bloomberg.Â

   Breaking down unions' Obamacare demands.Â "Often, industries that use
   these multiemployer plans donât employ a long-term, full-time
   workforce. ... A roofer, for instance, can go from job to job, without
   any interruption in coverage. With a traditional health plan, heâd
   change insurance each time he changes jobs â if he even got
   insurance.Â Smaller employers who now pay into these multiemployer
   plans may look at the deal their employees can get on the new Obamacare
   health insurance exchanges and decide they would be better off there.
   The unions are also worried about rising costs."Â [355]Brett Norman in
   Politico.Â

   Programs to treat the uninsured are facing an uncertain
   future.Â "HealthShare, geared to employees of small businesses in the
   Duluth, Minn., area, just announced that it will shut its doors at the
   end of December despite concerns that some of its 850 enrollees will
   have to pay much more in the new marketplaces.Â In the Houston area,
   the TexHealth Harris County 3-Share Plan is trying to determine if it
   complies with the law, said Daisy Morales, vice president of marketing.
   That program, which splits premiums between small employers, employees
   and a subsidy fund, has about 500 enrollees." [356]Phil Galewitz in
   Kaiser Health News.Â
