From East London to East Dupont: Duke's Grocery Opens Tomorrow

   Posted by [86]Jessica Sidman on Sep. 9, 2013 at 11:09 am

   dukesgrocery

   East London-inspired cafe/pub/market Duke's Grocery will begin offering
   internationally inspired sandwiches tomorrow for dinner and lunch,
   beginning at 11 a.m.

   The Dupont restaurant comes from former Rugby Cafe and Glover Park's
   Kitchen 2404 chef Alex McCoy, who spent some of his childhood in
   London, and Daniel Kramer, who organizes tasting tours like the [87]DC
   Beerathon, [88]Margarita March, and [89]DC Whiskey Walk.

   The menu will feature around 15 seasonally rotating sandwiches inspired
   by the international flavors represented in East London. Among the
   offerings: Brick Lane salt beef with brined brisket, house pickles, and
   mustard on toasted rye; the Proper Club with tandoori-spiced chicken,
   bacon, avocado, garlic-chili mayo, herb greens, and tomato; and a banh
   mi with apple hoisin-glazed pork shoulder, chicken liver pate, pickled
   daikon and carrot, cucumber, cilantro, chives, fish sauce, Sriracha,
   and mayo. Sandwiches, which Kramer promises will be substantial in
   size, will probably range from $7 to $13.  There will also be some
   seasonal salads and sides. (Check out a sample menu below.)

   The drink menu will include some local beers, an international
   selection of wines, as well as "new spins on classic cocktails." A
   twist on a dark and stormy called The Perfect Storm is made with
   house-made ginger-chili syrup. The Shoreditch Fizz is composed of
   citron vodka, prosecco, limoncello, anisette, lemon, and basil.

   Duke's Grocery will also have a market table, where patrons can shop
   for fresh produce from Potomac Farm Market (the same produce McCoy uses
   in his kitchen). Eventually, Duke's will also sell its own bottled
   products like jams and pickles. Breakfast and brunch will also start in
   the coming weeks and will include a full English breakfast and homemade
   pastries and cakes.

   CORRECTION: This story initially stated that sandwiches will cost $7 to
   $10. Kramer clarifies that the exact menu prices are still being ironed
   out but will likely range from $7 to $13.

       That takes cajones launching such a promising venture over in "Dead
       Man's Gulch". Back in the day, BMG (before Marilyn Grove) that was
       a thriving commercial corridor. Watch out for the moratorium
       vultures guys.

       I'm really excited about this place. Exactly what DC needs more of.
       A non-chain place to grab an inexpensive meal and not drop a ton of
       money.
