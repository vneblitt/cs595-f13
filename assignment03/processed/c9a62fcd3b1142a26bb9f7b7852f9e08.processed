   As EW's TV critics, we've already weighed in with [44]our six best new
   shows of the fall, including buzzy series like Marvel's Agents of
   S.H.I.E.L.D. and The Blacklist. But now, we present six more new shows
   -- these ones aren't necessarily the best, but there is potential in
   them. Here are the shows we'll be keeping our eye on this fall.

   Dracula
   Premieres Friday, Oct. 25, at 10 p.m. on NBC
   The vampire drama has been done to death. But if anyone can bring it
   back from its shriveled, dehydrated-human-jerky corpse, it‚s Jonathan
   Rhys Meyers, who‚s such a pale, slithery nightstalker, it‚s easy to
   believe he actually spends his nights slurping from goblets of Type-A
   Negative and growing out his fingernails to Nosferatu lengths. So it‚s
   a stroke of genius to cast him as Dracula in this 19th century period
   drama, which finds our fanged hero posing as an American entrepreneur
   so that he can seek revenge on the Order of the Dragon, a group of
   Victorian high-society folks who cursed him long ago. Because Dracula
   is brought to you by the exec producers of Downton Abbey, there‚s also
   plenty of frilly costumes and forbidden romance: Dracula keeps getting
   distracted by the beautiful Mina (Jessica DeGouw), who might be the
   reincarnation of his dead wife. The melodrama is cranked up so high,
   you can almost see Rhys Meyers stifling laughs. But Dracula‚s fight
   against the rich kids does have a certain 99-percenter timeliness, and
   the secret-society angle should excite the Comic-Con geeks --
   especially when Van Helsing shows up. ‚Melissa Maerz

   Hostages
   Premieres Monday, Sept. 23, 10 p.m. on CBS
   Based on an Israeli series with a similar concept, Hostages couldn‚t be
   more American if the kidnappers did their bargaining with Big Macs. It
   follows a rogue FBI agent (Dylan McDermott) who takes the president‚s
   surgeon (Toni Collette) hostage, along with her husband and two kids,
   and forces her to choose whether she‚ll help him assassinate POTUS, or
   let her family die. From the moment the opening scene clicks its
   stopwatch, ticking down the seconds in real time every episode, the
   influence of producer Jerry Bruckheimer and white-knuckle dramas like
   24 is clear. You could design a network thriller drinking game around
   this show, taking a shot every time there‚s a high-drama action
   sequence, or a secret revealed about a character (there‚s at least
   three in the pilot), or a shocker cliffhanger. Luckily, the creators
   and cast save it from becoming just another too-slick network
   procedural. Collette captures what panic feels like quite well, with
   darting eyes and frantic movements that can make anyone watching her
   feel anxious. Writer-director Jeffrey Nachmanoff, who has worked on
   Homeland, brings real suspense to the pilot, with camera angles that
   whip around corners and creep through doors, creating a burgeoning
   sense of paranoia within the Sanders house. And with a limited run of
   just 15 episodes, there‚s reason to believe that Hostages can sustain
   that tension until the inevitable Explosive, Homeland
   Security-Agitating Conclusion. ‚Melissa Maerz

   The Michael J. Fox Show
   Premieres Thursday, Sept. 26, at 9 p.m. at NBC
   There is Michael J. Fox before Parkinson's, and there is Michael J. Fox
   since Parkinson's, and the pilot episode of the living legend's latest
   sitcom trades off of our relationship to the icon to powerful effect.
   As an iconic NYC TV anchorman rethinking his choice to retire because
   of the disease and pour his considerable energies into being a
   stay-at-home super-dad‚¶which is driving his wife and three kids nuts.
   Fox is basically playing himself, and he does it well: "Mike Henry" is
   as naturally funny, emotionally open, and inspiring as his alter-ego.
   Through his family (which includes Breaking Bad`s Betsy Brandt at his
   wife), we see our response to Fox: Celebrating his moxy, grieving what
   has been lost, still adjusting to the new normal. The shows wants to
   find its humor and heart in being an unvarnished, unsentimental take on
   life with the disease -- the physical challenges, the relational
   complications, even sex. The pilot feels more like a promise of
   intention than proof of concept. But we root confidently for success.
   It's Michael J. Fox, after all. How can you not? ‚Jeff Jensen

   Mom
   Premieres Monday, Sept. 23, at 9:30 p.m. on CBS
   From Chuck Lorre (The Big Bang Theory, Mike & Molly) comes yet another
   well-cast sitcom that doesn't make you laugh as much as you want it to.
   But the lack of mirth in Mom is due to writing that takes seriously the
   rough edges of its lead character: Anna Faris is quite appealing as
   Christy, whose messy present and damaged history reveals itself by
   surprising degrees over the course of a smartly scaled pilot. She‚s a
   single mother with modest career prospects and two kids, including a
   wild child teen daughter who has zero respect for her authority, and
   for good reason: Mom is a recovering alcoholic whose efforts to reform
   might have more integrity if she still wasn‚t making dumb choice like
   dating her married-man boss. Christy is a bruised apple that hasn‚t
   fallen far from the tree: Her own mother, Bonnie (Allison Janney), is a
   former drug addict and rather unrepentant about her dubious brand of
   parenting, but not without her redeeming qualities. The pilot's
   poignancy and hard-knock, hard-living characters give this sitcom an
   interesting point of difference -- and if it can be, like, 19 percent
   funnier, it could be something special. ‚Jeff Jensen

   Reign
   Premieres Thursday, Oct. 17, at 9 p.m. on The CW
   Reign isn‚t your usual YA-on-CW with pretty young things, dubious adult
   supervision, a pop-rock soundtrack and a ghoul or two. No, it‚s mostly
   that -- but set in Renaissance France. Which makes the anachronistic
   music a bold choice, but like most aspects of Reign‚s ambitious pilot,
   it works. (I can‚t wait for them to figure out how to work in Lorde‚s
   summer surprise ‚Royals.‚) Adelaide Kane (Teen Wolf) is the grounded
   and gorgeous Mary, Queen of Scots, betrothed since early childhood to
   the future king of France (Toby Regbo). We meet her as she starts her
   adult life at the French royal court, at a time of intensifying
   religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants. She arrives with
   her future ladies in waiting, a hot and haute-ly coutured quartet that
   includes Anna Popplewell from the Chronicles of Narnia, and they
   immediately get to work producing steamy intrigues and politically
   charged conflict with a Court full of powerful, power-hungry
   personalities. Megan Fallows (Anne of Green Gables, all grown up) makes
   for a compelling villain as Queen Catherine, whose machinations are
   informed by input from a certain seer named Nostradamus (Rossif
   Sutherland). All of this, plus a mysterious castle ghost (?) who‚s
   watching out for Mary and a mysterious cult that resides in the
   surrounding woods and practices bloody rituals. Yes, Reign wants to be
   many things, and the pilot blends them well. Sustaining its winning mix
   of historical drama, Gothic romance, and modern soap will be the
   difference between a long rule and a short tenure. ‚Jeff Jensen

   Super Fun Night
   Premieres Wednesday, Oct. 2, at 9:30 p.m. on ABC
   At a time when buddy comedies almost always focus on men -- Dads,¬ We
   Are Men, a few other shows that could‚ve been called¬ Dudes Behaving
   Badly -- it‚s refreshing to see a show about three girlfriends who are
   just as buffoonish as the guys. For more than a decade, Kimmie
   (Wilson), Marika (Lauren Ash), and Helen-Alice (Liza Lapira) have spent
   every Friday night together, bypassing clubs and bars to hide out in
   their apartments and dress up in troll costumes or perform massively
   awkward singalongs from the musical Wicked. They're total nerds, and
   not in that
   just-remove-her-glasses-and-her-scrunchie-and-she's-actually-a-supermod
   el kind of way where nerdiness is just a trick to get a date. (‚C‚mon
   we don‚t need boyfriends,‚ the very butch Marika argues. ‚I can build
   all of our shelves.‚) And yet, when Kimmie riffs on Xena-like action
   figures with her work crush Richard (Kevin Bishop), or helps him
   workshop his tractor beam impression, there‚s legitimate chemistry
   there. True, the pilot isn‚t as funny as it could‚ve been, and the fat
   jokes are groaners. (Does Kimmie really have to rip her dress twice?)
   But coming off¬ Bridesmaids¬ and¬ Pitch Perfect, Wilson has so much
   potential that I can‚t give up on her (or her sketchy American accent)
   just yet. ‚Melissa Maerz
