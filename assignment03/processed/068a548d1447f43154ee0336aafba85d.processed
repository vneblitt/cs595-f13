       Interview with Nick Davidson, Ramsar Convention's Deputy Secretary
       General at CBD, COP11. The key role that rapidly diminishing
       wetlands play in supporting human life and biodiversity needs to be
       recognized and integrated into decision-making as a vital component
       of the transition to a resource-efficient, sustainable world
       economy, according to a new TEEB report released today.

UNEP Welcomes Renewed Commitment by World Leaders to Phase Out
Climate-Damaging HFCs Tue, Sep 10, 2013

In the G20 Leaders Declaration, governments agreed that the success of the
Montreal Protocol - which has overseen a 98 per cent of all global
consumption of controlled ozone-depleting substances, and contributed to tens
of millions of cases of avoided skin cancer and cataracts - should be
harnessed to phase out HFCs.

   UNEP Welcomes Renewed Commitment by World Leaders to Phase Out
   Climate-Damaging HFCs

   World leaders at the G20 summit underlined the need for fast action on
   short-lived climate pollutants in parallel with major reductions in
   carbon emissions.

   Nairobi, 10 September 2013 - The United Nations Environment Programme
   (UNEP) has welcomed an agreement by world leaders at the G20 summit in
   Moscow to renew efforts to tackle climate change by reducing emissions
   of potent greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).

   Governments from some 25 nations and the European Union agreed that
   phasing down the use of HFCs - carried out in parallel to reductions of
   carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions under the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - will make a vital contribution
   to tackling the effects of climate change.

       Benefits

   HFCs are widely used in refrigerators, air conditioners, and industrial
   applications as replacements for ozone-depleting substances being
   phased out under the UN's universally-ratified Montreal Protocol on
   Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.

   HFC emissions represent less than 1 per cent of current total
   greenhouse gases, but their warming impact is considerably stronger
   than CO_2.

   If left unchecked, they could account for up to nearly 20 per cent of
   carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.

   According to UNEP, fast action on HFCs and other non-CO_2 pollutants,
   could cut the rate of global warming by up to 0.5 degrees Celsius,
   reduce crop losses by over 30 million tonnes a year, and save millions
   of lives through fewer respiratory illnesses.

   "The leaders of the G20 group of nations have provided another positive
   signal towards the goal of realizing a universal climate agreement by
   2015 under the UN climate convention and the ultimate aim of sharply
   bringing down greenhouse gas emissions in line with the scientific
   imperative," said Achim Steiner, UN Under-Secretary General and UNEP
   Executive Director.

   "A sense of urgency and a willingness to act down multiple tracks is of
   the essence. While many countries can point to positive action in
   respect to emissions and a transition to a low carbon,
   resource-efficient and inclusive green economy, the stark reality is
   that levels of pollution in the atmosphere continue to rise with all
   the risks to lives, livelihoods and the global economy this entails,"
   added Mr Steiner.

   In the G20 Leaders Declaration, governments agreed that the success of
   the Montreal Protocol - which has overseen a 98 per cent of all global
   consumption of controlled ozone-depleting substances, and contributed
   to tens of millions of cases of avoided skin cancer and cataracts -
   should be harnessed to phase out HFCs.

   "Climate change will continue to have a significant impact on the world
   economy, and cost will be higher to the extent we delay additional
   actions," reads the G20 statement.

   "We reiterate our commitment to fight climate change and welcome the
   outcome of the 18th conference of the Parties to the UN climate change
   conferences. We also support complementary initiatives, through
   multilateral approaches that include using the expertise and the
   institutions of the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and
   consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), based on the examination of
   economically viable and technically feasible alternatives."

   The statement was signed by the following countries:  Argentina,
   Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia,
   Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South
   Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European
   Union, as well as Ethiopia, Spain, Senegal, Brunei, Kazakhstan, and
   Singapore.

   China and USA Renew Bilateral Efforts

   In a separate agreement at the G20 summit, President Obama of the USA
   and President Xi of China agreed to establish a contact group on HFCs
   under the Montreal Protocol to consider issues related to
   cost-effectiveness, financial and technology support, safety, and
   environmental benefits.

   The decision follows an announcement by both countries in June 2013 on
   closer co-operation to phase down the production and consumption of
   HFCs, while continuing to include HFCs within the scope of UNFCCC and
   its Kyoto Protocol provisions for accounting and reporting of
   greenhouse gas emissions.

   Climate and Clean Air Coalition

   UNEP in partnership with over 60 countries and organizations is working
   to phase down the use of HFCs and other substances known as short-lived
   climate pollutants, including black carbon or 'soot' and methane, under
   the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC).

   The voluntary coalition - founded in 2012 - is promoting rapid
   reductions in short-lived climate pollutants to tackle air pollution,
   improve human health and agriculture, and provide near-term climate
   benefits.

   Under a business-as-usual scenario, according to UNEP, by 2050 HFCs
   could be responsible for emissions equivalent to 3.5 to 8.8 Gigatonnes
   (Gt) of CO_2. This is equivalent to the total current annual carbon
   emissions from transport, estimated at around 6-7 Gt.

   The coalition states that actions on short term climate pollutants need
   to be complemented by deep and rapid cuts in CO_2 emissions if the
   global average temperature increase over the 21st Century is to be held
   below 2°C.

   Among its many activities, the CCAC is working with 10 major cities
   including Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, Stockholm, Accra, and New York to
   accelerate methane reductions from landfills and black carbon or 'soot'
   from burning wastes.
