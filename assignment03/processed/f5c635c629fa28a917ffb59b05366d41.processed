Frequently Asked Questions About Our Panda Cub

When will the cub be on exhibit?

   The David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat will reopen to the
   public when the cub is about four months old, though the exact timing
   will depend on Mei Xiang and the cub.

Will this cub go to China?

   Yes, the cub will go to China after four years.

When will the cub get a name?

   It is traditional to name giant panda cubs when they are 100 days old.

Why do you need a DNA test to determine the cubâs sex?

   External genitalia in bears doesn't develop until the bear is several
   months old. We should be able to tell the sex of the cub in a few
   weeks. The best, and most reliable, way to determine a bear cub's sex
   is through DNA analysis.

How did you determine the window for a possible birth?

   The panda team prepared for a panda cub birth based on behaviors they
   saw, hormones they monitored, and a new test that measured Mei Xiang's
   levels of prostaglandin metabolite. National Zoo scientists detected a
   secondary rise in Mei Xiang's urinary progesterone July 10. That rise
   indicated that she would give birth to a cub or experience a
   pseudopregnancy in 40 to 55 days. Scientists at the Memphis Zoo
   analyzed her levels of prostaglandin metabolite. They determined that
   if Mei Xiang was pregnant she would give birth to a cub between August
   22 and August 26. If she was not her pseudpregnancy would end between
   August 29 and September 8.

   The panda team has also been monitoring Mei Xiang 24-hours-a-day since
   August 7. They began to see behaviors consistent with a pregnancy or
   pseudopregnancy since August 11, when she began body licking and object
   cradling.

Why did you use sperm from both Tian Tian and Gao Gao?

   In China, it is standard practice to use sperm from more than one male
   when artificially inseminating a female. This increases the chances of
   fertilization and viable embryos.

Why is Mei Xiang in such a small space?

   In the wild, bears--including giant pandas--give birth in small dens.
   In China's Wolong Reserve, pandas make their dens in large hollow
   conifer trees, with a diameter of about three feet. Where there aren't
   any trees, pandas den in caves with a little bedding of twigs. They
   stay in these dens for about the cub's first 100 days.

   We strive to recreate these surroundings for Mei Xiang. In January of
   this year, in anticipation of the breeding season, we rearranged Mei
   Xiang's den. We shifted the angle of the bars, so that keepers have
   more direct access to Mei Xiang and her cub while they are resting in
   the nest area. The old bars were recycled, making the renovations not
   only a little greener, but also a little less overwhelming for Mei
   Xiang. It was as if the "furniture" was simply rearranged one day.

Why isn't Mei eating?

   When bears give birth in the wild, the mothers spend several months
   denned up with their cubs. Their focus during this time is nurturing
   and protecting their cubs, rather than eating. Scientists have observed
   giant panda mothers in the wild go as long as a month without eating or
   drinking. Like other bears, pandas seem to go through a metabolic shift
   during the summer months, when their food intake drops up to 75
   percent. This coincides with when pandas den and produce cubs, like
   other bear species. One difference to note is that other bears fast for
   several months during hibernation.

Will Tian Tian meet the cub?

   Male pandas are not involved in the care of their cubs. Fathers and
   cubs may never encounter each other in the wild.

Why are you performing frequent health checks on the cub this year?

   The panda teamâs primary goal is always to provide Mei Xiang with the
   opportunity to raise her cub, however, since she gave birth to a cub
   last year that did not survive they will conduct health checks earlier
   than they ever have before. (The panda team includes keepers,
   trained-volunteer behavior watchers, veterinarians and scientists.) In
   the first days of life, the cub and Mei Xiang, will be monitored 24
   hours a day via the panda cams.

   Brandie Smith, senior curator and curator of Giant Pandas, keepers and
   veterinarians will determine how many health checks the cub will
   receive.

What do you do during the health checks?

   When the panda team conducts a health check they have a list of things
   to accomplish. They will measure the cub's body weight, assess
   hydration, take a body measurement, check the oral cavity, check the
   umbilicus, check genitalia and rectal area, palpate the abdominal
   cavity, take a fecal culture, take the rectal temperature, listen for a
   heartbeat and lung sounds, and collect any urine produced.

   The team will also evaluate Mei Xiang and attempt to collect milk
   samples from her.

How do you swap the cub from the den?

   Mei Xiang's den was rearranged earlier this year to allow the panda
   team to get closer to her and a cub to do health checks, or retrieve
   the cub. There is a barrier in the den, which keeps members of the
   panda team safe when they enter the den with Mei Xiang and the cub. Mei
   Xiang and the keepers are never on the same side of the barrier.

   When the panda team removes the cub from the den for a health check a
   minimum of two keepers are always present. (No more than three keepers
   enter the den at the same time.) One keeper focuses on retrieving the
   cub, and another keeper monitors Mei Xiang. Keepers will offer Mei
   Xiang bamboo, juice, sugarcane or honey water while they retrieve the
   cub.

   They will pick the cub up with a gloved hand.

Why is a keeper from China helping you?

   Li Guo the giant panda keeper visiting from China is supporting the
   National Zoo's panda team. He is a giant panda cub nursery expert. Li
   has extensive experience caring for cubs.

   The panda team does not yet know how long he will be staying at the Zoo
   to support them.

How can I help pandas?

   China by giving to the Giant Panda Conservation Fund. [108]Donate now.
