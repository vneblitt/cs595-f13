Authorities identify seven of the 12 people killed in Navy Yard shooting

   [297][Was7913428.jpg]

   [298]View Photo Gallery -- Rampage at Navy Yard: At least 13 people are
   dead and others wounded after a shooter opened fire at the Washington
   Navy Yard on Monday, police said. But hours after the rampage began, it
   was still unclear whether the shooting was the act of a lone gunman, or
   if other shooters were involved.

   Thirteen people are dead and at least eight others were injured after a
   gunman opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, officials
   said, spreading fear and chaos across the region as authorities sought
   to contain the panic.

   The incident, in which the death toll rose almost hourly, represents
   the single worst loss of life in the District since an airliner plunged
   into the Potomac River in 1982, killing 78.

   [316]Mental illness among black men long misdiagnosed

   Courtland Milloy

   The consequences of mental illness among black men extends beyond the
   Navy Yard to daily gun violence.

   D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier and Mayor Vincent C. Gray announced
   the mounting number of casualties in a series of news conferences. The
   suspected shooter, identified by the FBI as Aaron Alexis, 34, living in
   Fort Worth, is among the dead. Alexis was a military contractor, one
   official said.

   Hours after the rampage began it remained unclear whether the shooting
   was the act of a lone gunman, or if other shooters were involved.
   Lanier initially said authorities were looking for two more potential
   shooters dressed in military style clothing. Shortly after she
   announced a detailed description of two suspects, city officials said
   one had been located and cleared. And at a 10 p.m. news conference she
   said police were comfortable the shooting had been committed by one
   person.

   Police are asking anyone with information on the suspect to call
   202-727-9099.

   Lanier lifted the shelter in place order for the neighborhood around
   the Navy Yard that had been in place for much of the day.

   Gray said those killed by the shooter ranged in age from 46-73 years
   old. He said the families of seven of the victims had been notified.
   Those victims were identified as: Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier,
   53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Bernard
   Proctor, 46; and Vishnu Pandit, 61.

   The families of the six other victims were in the process of being
   notified.

   Lanier said one of those killed was a District resident, but she did
   not identify the person.

   Gray said another eight people were injured in the attack. He said
   three people were shot, including Metropolitan Police Officer Scott
   Williams. Gray said the officer was doing well.

   The other five had either stress related injuries, and at least one was
   someone who fell.

   Vice Adm. Bill French earlier had said that the number of injured was
   14.

   [For up to the minute information about the shooting, check The Post's
   [317]live blog .]

   Gray said no motive is known yet. He said there is no reason to believe
   it was an act of terrorism, though he added that he could not rule it
   out.

   As of 8:30 p.m. Monday, Navy officials said about 2,000 people remained
   on base, and that it could take another 3-4 hours before everyone was
   cleared to leave.

   The FBI was still interviewing every person leaving the base out of
   concern that a second suspect may still be at large, French said. And
   SWAT teams are still finding people hiding in places on the base, where
   some had remained hunkered down since the initial attack early Monday
   morning. One city officials said that shortly before 7 p.m., officers
   found an employee hiding in a locker, where the employee had been for
   nearly 11 hours.
