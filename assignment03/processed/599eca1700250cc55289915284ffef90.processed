Library of Congress acts as America's hard drive

   There's more than one site for the Library of Congress, and some of its
   campuses can be pretty far outside of the Beltway and off the beaten
   path, while still serving an important job.

   Located 70 miles southwest of D.C., the Library of Congress's Packard
   Campus is in Culpeper, Va. In a thick, sturdy building that makes you
   feel as if you're perpetually in some sort of "LOST" bunker (it
   actually was built as an apocalypse bunker during the Cold War), it is
   ground zero for the library's efforts to digitize and save every TV
   program, movie, CD and album in American history. Even video games and
   the occasional YouTube clip. Although it's unlikely that they'll bother
   with your 2009 vacation video, it's not impossible either.
