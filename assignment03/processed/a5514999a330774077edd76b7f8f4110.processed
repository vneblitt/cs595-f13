[31]Answering Helen Thomas on Why

   By [32]Ray McGovern

   Thank God for Helen Thomas, the only person to show any courage at the
   White House press briefing after President Barack Obama gave a flaccid
   account of the intelligence screw-up that almost downed an airliner on
   Christmas Day.

   After Obama briefly addressed L'Affaire Abdulmutallab and wrote "must
   do better" on the report cards of the national security schoolboys
   responsible for the near catastrophe, the President turned the stage
   over to counter-terrorism guru John Brennan and Department of Homeland
   Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.

   It took 89-year old veteran correspondent Helen Thomas to break through
   the vapid remarks about rechanneling "intelligence streams," fixing
   "no-fly" lists, deploying "behavior detection officers," and buying
   more body-imaging scanners.

   Thomas recognized the John & Janet filibuster for what it was, as her
   catatonic press colleagues took their customary dictation and asked
   their predictable questions. Instead, Thomas posed an adult query that
   spotlighted the futility of government plans to counter terrorism with
   more high-tech gizmos and more intrusions on the liberties and privacy
   of the traveling public.

   She asked why Abdulmutallab did what he did.

   Thomas: "And what is the motivation? We never hear what you find out on
   why."

   Brennan: "Al Qaeda is an organization that is dedicated to murder and
   wanton slaughter of innocents... They attract individuals like Mr.
   Abdulmutallab and use them for these types of attacks. He was motivated
   by a sense of religious sort of drive. Unfortunately, al Qaeda has
   perverted Islam, and has corrupted the concept of Islam, so that he's
   (sic) able to attract these individuals. But al Qaeda has the agenda of
   destruction and death."

   Thomas: "And you're saying it's because of religion?"

   Brennan: "I'm saying it's because of an al Qaeda organization that used
   the banner of religion in a very perverse and corrupt way."

   Thomas: "Why?"

   Brennan: "I think this is a -- long issue, but al Qaeda is just
   determined to carry out attacks here against the homeland."

   Thomas: "But you haven't explained why."

   Neither did President Obama, nor anyone else in the U.S.
   political/media hierarchy. All the American public gets is the
   boilerplate about how al-Qaeda evildoers are perverting a religion and
   exploiting impressionable young men.

   There is almost no discussion about why so many people in the Muslim
   world object to U.S. policies so strongly that they are inclined to
   resist violently and even resort to suicide attacks.

   Obama's Non-Answer

   I had been hoping Obama would say something intelligent about what
   drove Abdulmutallab to do what he did, but the President uttered a few
   vacuous comments before sending in the clowns. This is what he said
   before he walked away from the podium:

   "It is clear that al Qaeda increasingly seeks to recruit individuals
   without known terrorist affiliations ... to do their bidding. ... And
   that's why we must communicate clearly to Muslims around the world that
   al Qaeda offers nothing except a bankrupt vision of misery and death
   ... while the United States stands with those who seek justice and
   progress. ... That's the vision that is far more powerful than the
   hatred of these violent extremists."

   But why it is so hard for Muslims to "get" that message? Why can't they
   end their preoccupation with dodging U.S. missiles in Afghanistan,
   Pakistan, Yemen and Gaza long enough to reflect on how we are only
   trying to save them from terrorists while simultaneously demonstrating
   our commitment to "justice and progress"?

   Does a smart fellow like Obama expect us to believe that all we need to
   do is "communicate clearly to Muslims" that it is al Qaeda, not the
   U.S. and its allies, that brings "misery and death"? Does any informed
   person not know that the unprovoked U.S.-led invasion of Iraq killed
   hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and displaced 4.5 million from their
   homes? How is that for "misery and death"?

   Rather than a failure to communicate, U.S. officials are trying to
   rewrite recent history, which seems to be much easier to accomplish
   with the Washington press corps and large segments of the American
   population than with the Muslim world.

   But why isn't there a frank discussion by America's leaders and media
   about the real motivation of Muslim anger toward the United States? Why
   was Helen Thomas the only journalist to raise the touchy but central
   question of motive?

   Peeking Behind the Screen

   We witnessed a similar phenomenon when the 9/11 Commission Report
   tiptoed into a cautious discussion of possible motives behind the 9/11
   attacks. To their credit, the drafters of that report apparently went
   as far as their masters would allow, in gingerly introducing a major
   elephant into the room:

   "America's policy choices have consequences. Right or wrong, it is
   simply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian
   conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of popular
   commentary across the Arab and Muslim world." (p. 376)

   When asked later about the flabby way that last sentence ended, former
   Congressman Lee Hamilton, Vice-Chair of the 9/11 Commission, explained
   that there had been a Donnybrook over whether that paragraph could be
   included at all.

   The drafters also squeezed in the reason given by Khalid Sheikh
   Mohammed as to why he "masterminded" the attacks on 9/11:

   "By his own account, KSM's animus toward the United States stemmed ...
   from his violent disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring
   Israel."

   Would you believe that former Vice President Dick Cheney has also
   pointed to U.S. support for Israel as one of the "true sources of
   resentment"? This unique piece of honesty crept into his speech to the
   American Enterprise Institute on May 21, 2009.

   Sure, he also trotted out the bromide that the terrorists hate "all the
   things that make us a force for good in the world." But the Israel
   factor slipped into the speech, perhaps an inadvertent acknowledgement
   of the Israeli albatross adorning the neck of U.S. policy in the Middle
   East.

   Very few pundits and academicians are willing to allude to this
   reality, presumably out of fear for their future career prospects.

   Former senior CIA officer Paul Pillar, now a professor at Georgetown
   University, is one of the few willing to refer, in his typically
   understated way, to "all the other things ... including policies and
   practices that affect the likelihood that people ... will be
   radicalized, and will try to act out the anger against us." One has to
   fill in the blanks regarding what those "other things" are.

   But no worries. Secretary Napolitano has a fix for this unmentionable
   conundrum. It's called "counter-radicalization," which she describes
   thusly:

   "How do we identify someone before they become radicalized to the point
   where they're ready to blow themselves up with others on a plane? And
   how do we communicate better American values and so forth ... around
   the globe?"

   Better communication. That's the ticket.

   Hypocrisy and Double Talk

   But Napolitano doesn't acknowledge the underlying problem, which is
   that many Muslims have watched Washington's behavior closely for many
   years and view U.S. declarations about peace, justice, democracy and
   human rights as infuriating examples of hypocrisy and double talk.

   So, Washington's sanitized discussion about motives for terrorism seems
   more intended for the U.S. domestic audience than the Muslim world.

   After all, people in the Middle East already know how Palestinians have
   been mistreated for decades; how Washington has propped up Arab
   dictatorships; how Muslims have been locked away at Guantanamo without
   charges; how the U.S. military has killed civilians in Iraq,
   Afghanistan and elsewhere; how U.S. mercenaries have escaped punishment
   for slaughtering innocents.

   The purpose of U.S. "public diplomacy" appears more designed to shield
   Americans from this unpleasant reality, offering instead feel-good
   palliatives about the beneficence of U.S. actions. Most American
   journalists and politicians go along with the charade out of fear that
   otherwise they would be accused of lacking patriotism or sympathizing
   with "the enemy."

   Commentators who are neither naïve nor afraid are simply shut out of
   the Fawning Corporate Media (FCM). Salon.com's Glen Greenwald, for
   example, has complained loudly about "how our blind, endless enabling
   of Israeli actions fuels terrorism directed at the U.S.," and how it is
   taboo to point this out.

   Greenwald recently called attention to a little-noticed Associated
   Press report on the possible motives of the 23-year-old Nigerian
   Abdulmutallab. The report quoted his Yemeni friends to the effect that
   the he was "not overtly extremist." But they noted that he was open
   about his sympathies toward the Palestinians and his anger over
   Israel's actions in Gaza. (emphasis added)

   Former CIA specialist on al Qaeda, Michael Scheuer, has been still more
   outspoken on what he sees as Israel's tying down the American Gulliver
   in the Middle East. Speaking Monday on C-SPAN, he complained bitterly
   that any debate on the issue of American support for Israel and its
   effects is normally squelched.

   Scheuer added that the Israel Lobby had just succeeded in getting him
   removed from his job at the Jamestown Foundation think tank for saying
   that Obama was "doing what I call the Tel Aviv Two Step."

   More to the point, Scheuer asserted:

   "For anyone to say that our support for Israel doesn't hurt us in the
   Muslim world ... is to just defy reality."

   Beyond loss of work, those who speak out can expect ugly accusations.
   The Israeli media network Arutz Sheva, which is considered the voice of
   the settler movement, weighed in strongly, citing Scheuer's C-SPAN
   remarks and branding them "blatantly anti-Semitic."

   Media Squelching

   As for media squelching, I continue to be amazed at how otherwise
   informed folks express total surprise when I refer them to Khalid
   Sheikh Mohammed's statement about his motivation for attacking the
   United States, as cited on page 147 of the 9/11 Commission Report:

   "By his own account, KSM's animus toward the United States stemmed not
   from his experience there as a student, but rather from his violent
   disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel."

   And one can understand how even those following such things closely can
   get confused. Five years after the 9/11 Commission Report, on Aug. 30,
   2009, readers of the neoconservative Washington Post were given a
   diametrically different view, based on what the Post called "an
   intelligence summary:"

   "KSM's limited and negative experience in the United States -- which
   included a brief jail stay because of unpaid bills -- almost certainly
   helped propel him on his path to becoming a terrorist ... He stated
   that his contact with Americans, while minimal, confirmed his view that
   the United States was a debauched and racist country."

   Apparently, the Post found this revisionist version politically more
   convenient, in that it obscured Mohammed's other explanation
   implicating "U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel." It's much more
   comforting to view KSM as a disgruntled visitor who nursed his personal
   grievances into justification for mass murder.

   An unusually candid view of the dangers accruing from the U.S.
   identification with Israel's policies appeared five years ago in an
   unclassified study published by the Pentagon-appointed U.S. Defense
   Science Board on Sept. 23, 2004. Contradicting President George W.
   Bush, the board stated:

   "Muslims do not `hate our freedom,' but rather, they hate our policies.
   The overwhelming majority voice their objections to what they see as
   one-sided support in favor of Israel and against Palestinian rights,
   and the longstanding, even increasing support for what Muslims
   collectively see as tyrannies, most notably Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
   Jordan, Pakistan, and the Gulf States.

   "Thus, when American public diplomacy talks about bringing democracy to
   Islamic societies, this is seen as no more than self-serving
   hypocrisy."

   Abdulmutallab's Attack

   Getting back to Abdulmutallab and his motive in trying to blow up the
   airliner, how was this individual without prior terrorist affiliations
   suddenly transformed into an international terrorist ready to die while
   killing innocents?

   If, as John Brennan seems to suggest, al Qaeda terrorists are
   hard-wired for terrorism at birth for the "wanton slaughter of
   innocents," how are they able to jump-start a privileged 23-year old
   Nigerian, inculcate in him with the acquired characteristics of a
   terrorist, and persuade him to do the bidding of al Qaeda/Persian Gulf?

   As indicated above, the young Nigerian seems to have had particular
   trouble with Israel's wanton slaughter of more than a thousand
   civilians in Gaza a year ago, a brutal campaign that was defended in
   Washington as justifiable self-defense.

   Moreover, it appears that Abdulmuttallab is not the only anti-American
   "terrorist" so motivated. When the Saudi and Yemeni branches of al
   Qaeda announced that they were uniting into "al Qaeda of the Arabian
   Peninsula," their combined rhetoric railed against the Israeli attack
   on Gaza.

   And on Dec. 30, Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al-Balawi, a 32-year-old
   Palestinian-born Jordanian physician, killed seven American CIA
   operatives and one Jordanian intelligence officer near Khost,
   Afghanistan, when he detonated a suicide bomb.

   Though most U.S. media stories treated al-Balawi as a fanatical
   double-agent driven by irrational hatreds, other motivations could be
   gleaned by carefully reading articles about his personal history.

   Al-Balawi's mother told Agence France-Presse that her son had never
   been an "extremist." Al-Balawi's widow, Defne Bayrak, made a similar
   statement to Newsweek. In a New York Times article, al-Balawi's brother
   was quoted as describing him as a "very good brother" and a "brilliant
   doctor."

   So what led al-Balawi to take his own life in order to kill U.S. and
   Jordanian intelligence operatives?

   Al-Balawi's widow said her husband "started to change" after the
   American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. His brother said al-Balawi
   "changed" during last year's three-week-long Israeli offensive in Gaza,
   which killed about 1,300 Palestinians.

   When al-Balawi volunteered with a medical organization to treat injured
   Palestinians in Gaza, he was arrested by Jordanian authorities, his
   brother said.

   It was after that arrest that the Jordanian intelligence service
   apparently coerced or "recruited" al-Balawi to become a spy who would
   penetrate al Qaeda's hierarchy and provide actionable intelligence to
   the CIA.

   "If you catch a cat and put it in a corner, she will jump on you," the
   brother said in explaining why al-Balawi would turn to a suicide
   attack.

   "My husband was anti-American; so am I," his widow said, adding that
   her two little girls would grow up fatherless but that she had no
   regrets.

   Answering Helen

   Are we starting to get the picture of what the United States is up
   against in the Muslim world?

   Does Helen Thomas deserve an adult answer to her question about motive?
   Has President Obama been able to assimilate all this?

   Or is the U.S. political/media establishment incapable of confronting
   this reality and/or taking meaningful action to alleviate the
   underlying causes of the violence?

   Is the reported reaction of a CIA official to al-Balawi's attack the
   appropriate one: "Last week's attack will be avenged. Some very bad
   people will eventually have a very bad day."

   Revenge has not always turned out very well in the past.

   Does anyone remember the brutal killing of four Blackwater contractors
   on March 31, 2004, when they took a wrong turn and ended up in the
   Iraqi city of Fallujah -- and how U.S. forces virtually leveled that
   large city in retribution after George W. Bush won his second term the
   following November?

   If you read only the Fawning Corporate Media, you would blissfully
   think that the killing of the four Blackwater operatives was the work
   of fanatical animals who got - along with their neighbors - what they
   deserved. You wouldn't know that the killings represented the second
   turn in that specific cycle of violence.

   On March 22, 2004, Israeli forces assassinated the then-spiritual
   leader of Hamas in Gaza, Sheikh Yassin -- a withering old man, blind
   and confined to a wheelchair.

   That murder, plus sloppy navigation by the Blackwater men, set the
   stage for the next set of brutalities. The Blackwater operatives were
   killed by a group that described itself as the "Sheikh Yassin Revenge
   Brigade."

   Pamphlets and posters were all over the scene of the attack; one of the
   trucks that pulled around body parts of the mercenaries had a poster of
   Yassin in its window, as did store fronts all over Fallujah.

   We can wish Janet Napolitano luck with her "counter-radicalization"
   project and President Obama with his effort to "communicate clearly to
   Muslims," but there will be no diminution in the endless cycles of
   violence unless legitimate grievances are addressed on all sides.

   It might also help if the American people were finally let in on the
   root causes for what otherwise get dismissed as irrational actions by
   Muslims.
