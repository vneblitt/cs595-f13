   This book is a mixture of more than one myth. It has a really cool
   interpretation of the Egyptian myth and references the Persephone and
   Orpheus myth. I really liked the characters because they are
   complicated. My favorite character is Cole because he is not what he
   seems to be. This ends on a cliffhanger and I am really looking forward
   to the next book Everbound.

   Really good version of the Persephone myth. Nikki accepts to be taken
   for 100 years of living beneath in order to fuel her leach. Little do
   we know, that tradition has been broken and the unheard of has
   occurred. The food has returned to reconnect with her life before she
   must surrender it again for one more time.

   `Everneath' was an emotional rollercoaster. It tackled some hard
   topics; the loss of loved-ones and our wish to sometimes just have our
   feelings go away. Overall I'd definitely recommend Ashton's debut
   novel, that is if you don't mind grabbing a box of tissues and feeling
   a little sad when it ends. Goodreads promises there will be a sequel
   thank goodness.

   I couldn't put this book down. The story begins with Nikki returning
   from 100 years of stasis to the real world where only 6 months have
   passed. She is trying to reconnect with her family, her friends and
   make amends with the boy she left behind. To complicate everything,
   Cole, the one who took her to the everneath is trying to coax her back
   before her time on the surface runs out. The story jumps from the
   present to the past and back again as Ashton reveals the truth behind
   what drove the heroine into Cole's arms. I couldn't stop until I got to
   this critical point (around page 250 when I looked at my clock at 3am).
   The book is well written and has good pacing. Although the cover blurb
   alludes to the story being a reworking of the Hades and Persephone
   tale, there are several Greek myths worked into the plot. Overall it's
   fun trying to figure out what's going on and how Nikki can hope to
   escape her fate.

   Everneath is the story of Nikki "Becks" Beckett, a teenage girl who has
   been missing for six months, only to mysteriously reappear one day in
   her hometown -- without explanation. Speculation of Nikki's whereabouts
   abound, with the general consensus being that she was off somewhere
   doing drugs. What Nikki hasn't told anyone is that in the six months
   she was gone, she'd actually spent an entire century in the Everneath,
   another dimension of sorts, underground, which is dominion to a race of
   immortals called the Everliving. In order to stave off their own
   mortality, the Everlivings need to "feed" on a human's life force every
   one-hundred of our years. These humans, called Forfeits, don't usually
   survive the century-long process -- but Nikki did, and that makes her
   special. Her Everliving host, Cole, wants her to join him and become an
   Everliving herself, but Nikki refuses because she doesn't want to Feed
   on humans that way Cole fed on her. However, unless she follows Cole
   and becomes an immortal, she's doomed to the Tunnels, where she will be
   a part of what keeps the Everneath running -- until she ceases to
   exist. She has six months back in her own world, before the Shades will
   come for her and drag her back to the Tunnels. And all Nikki wants is
   time to say goodbye

   Before I could stop him, he grabbed behind my head, pulled me toward
   him, and kissed me. For a moment, I didn't fight it. For a moment, I
   let him steal the deepest layers of my pain. Desperation replaced
   reason in my head. He seemed surprised that I hadn't pulled back, and
   he briefly opened his eyes, searching my face. I didn't move, and he
   kissed me again.

   "'I want what Hades and Persephone had, and I can't do it without you.
   The only time the queen of the Everneath had been overthrown is when
   and Everliving has found his perfect match. I've spent my whole
   life--and it's a long one, trust me---looking for my perfect match, and
   it's you. I knew you were different from the first moment I met you.
   The first moment you placed your hands in mine.'"
