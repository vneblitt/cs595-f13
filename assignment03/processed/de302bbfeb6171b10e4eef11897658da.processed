   10 Chemical Weapons Attacks Washington Doesn't Want You to Talk About

   [16]Follow @policymic

   Washington doesn't merely lack the legal authority for a military
   intervention in Syria. It lacks the moral authority. We're talking
   about a government with a history of using chemical weapons against
   innocent people far more prolific and deadly than [17]the mere
   accusations Assad faces from a trigger-happy Western
   military-industrial complex, bent on stifling further investigation
   before striking.
   Here is a list of 10 chemical weapons attacks carried out by the U.S.
   government or its allies against civilians.
   1. The U.S. Military Dumped 20 Million Gallons of Chemicals on Vietnam
   from 1962 - 1971

   During the Vietnam War, the U.S. military [18]sprayed 20 million
   gallons of chemicals, including the very toxic Agent Orange, on the
   forests and farmlands of Vietnam and neighboring countries,
   deliberately destroying food supplies, shattering the jungle ecology,
   and ravaging the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
   Vietnam [19]estimates that as a result of the decade-long chemical
   attack, 400,000 people were killed or maimed, 500,000 babies have been
   born with birth defects, and 2 million have suffered from cancer or
   other illnesses. In 2012, the Red Cross [20]estimated that one million
   people in Vietnam have disabilities or health problems related to Agent
   Orange.
   2. Israel Attacked Palestinian Civilians with White Phosphorus in 2008
   - 2009
   10, chemical, weapons, attacks, washington, doesnt, want, you, to,
   talk, about,
   Via: AP

   White phosphorus is a horrific incendiary chemical weapon that melts
   human flesh right down to the bone.

   In 2009, [21]multiple human rights groups, including Human Rights
   Watch, Amnesty International, and International Red Cross reported that
   the Israeli government was attacking civilians in their own country
   with chemical weapons. An Amnesty International team claimed to find
   "indisputable evidence of the widespread use of white phosphorus" as a
   weapon in densely-populated civilian areas. The Israeli military denied
   the allegations at first, but [22]eventually admitted they were true.

   After the string of allegations by these NGOs, the Israeli military
   even hit a UN headquarters(!) in Gaza [23]with a chemical attack. How
   do you think all this evidence compares to [24]the case against Syria?
   Why didn't Obama try to bomb Israel?
   3. Washington Attacked Iraqi Civilians with White Phosphorus in 2004
   10, chemical, weapons, attacks, washington, doesnt, want, you, to,
   talk, about,
   Via: AP

   In 2004, journalists embedded with the U.S. military in Iraq [25]began
   reporting the use of white phosphorus in Fallujah against Iraqi
   insurgents. First [26]the military lied and said that it was only using
   white phosphorus to create smokescreens or illuminate targets. Then
   [27]it admitted to using the volatile chemical as an incendiary weapon.
   At the time, Italian television broadcaster RAI aired a documentary
   entitled, "Fallujah, The Hidden Massacre," including grim video footage
   and photographs, as well as eyewitness interviews with Fallujah
   residents and U.S. soldiers revealing how the U.S. government
   indiscriminately rained white chemical fire down on the Iraqi city and
   melted women and children to death.
   4. The CIA Helped Saddam Hussein Massacre Iranians and Kurds with
   Chemical Weapons in 1988
   10, chemical, weapons, attacks, washington, doesnt, want, you, to,
   talk, about,

   [28]CIA records now prove that Washington knew Saddam Hussein was using
   chemical weapons (including sarin, nerve gas, and mustard gas) in the
   Iran-Iraq War, yet continued to pour intelligence into the hands of the
   Iraqi military, informing Hussein of Iranian troop movements while
   knowing that he would be using the information to launch chemical
   attacks. At one point in early 1988, Washington warned Hussein of an
   Iranian troop movement that would have ended the war in a decisive
   defeat for the Iraqi government. By March an emboldened Hussein with
   new friends in Washington [29]struck a Kurdish village occupied by
   Iranian troops with multiple chemical agents, killing as many as 5,000
   people and injuring as many as 10,000 more, most of them civilians.
   Thousands more died in the following years from complications,
   diseases, and birth defects.
   5. The Army Tested Chemicals on Residents of Poor, Black St. Louis
   Neighborhoods in The 1950s
   10, chemical, weapons, attacks, washington, doesnt, want, you, to,
   talk, about,

   In the early 1950s, the Army set up motorized blowers on top of
   residential high-rises in low-income, mostly black St. Louis
   neighborhoods, including areas where as much as 70% of the residents
   were children under 12. The government told residents that it was
   experimenting with a smokescreen to protect the city from Russian
   attacks, but [30]it was actually pumping the air full of hundreds of
   pounds of finely powdered zinc cadmium sulfide. The government admits
   that there was a second ingredient in the chemical powder, but whether
   or not that ingredient was radioactive [31]remains classified. Of
   course it does. Since the tests, an alarming number of the area's
   residents have developed cancer. In 1955, Doris Spates was born in one
   of the buildings the Army used to fill the air with chemicals from 1953
   - 1954. Her father died inexplicably that same year, she has seen four
   siblings die from cancer, and Doris herself is a survivor of cervical
   cancer.
   6. Police Fired Tear Gas at Occupy Protesters in 2011
   10, chemical, weapons, attacks, washington, doesnt, want, you, to,
   talk, about,

   The savage violence of the police against Occupy protesters in 2011 was
   well documented, and [32]included the use of tear gas and other
   chemical irritants. Tear gas [33]is prohibited for use against enemy
   soldiers in battle by the Chemical Weapons Convention. Can't police
   give civilian protesters in Oakland, California the same courtesy and
   protection that international law requires for enemy soldiers on a
   battlefield?
   7. The FBI Attacked Men, Women, and Children With Tear Gas in Waco in
   1993
   10, chemical, weapons, attacks, washington, doesnt, want, you, to,
   talk, about,

   At [34]the infamous Waco siege of a peaceful community of Seventh Day
   Adventists, [35]the FBI pumped tear gas into buildings knowing that
   women, children, and babies were inside. The tear gas was highly
   flammable and ignited, engulfing the buildings in flames and killing 49
   men and women, and 27 children, including babies and toddlers.
   Remember, attacking an armed enemy soldier on a battlefield with tear
   gas is a war crime. What kind of crime is attacking a baby with tear
   gas?
   8. The U.S. Military Littered Iraq with Toxic Depleted Uranium in 2003
   10, chemical, weapons, attacks, washington, doesnt, want, you, to,
   talk, about,
   Via: AP

   In Iraq, the U.S. military has littered the environment with thousands
   of tons of munitions [36]made from depleted uranium, a [37]toxic and
   radioactive nuclear waste product. As a result, more than half of
   babies born in Fallujah from 2007 - 2010 [38]were born with birth
   defects. Some of these defects have never been seen before outside of
   textbooks with photos of babies born near nuclear tests in the Pacific.
   Cancer and infant mortality [39]have also seen a dramatic rise in Iraq.
   [40]According to Christopher Busby, the Scientific Secretary of the
   European Committee on Radiation Risk, "These are weapons which have
   absolutely destroyed the genetic integrity of the population of Iraq."
   After authoring two of four reports published in 2012 on the health
   crisis in Iraq, Busby described Fallujah as having, "the highest rate
   of genetic damage in any population ever studied."
   9. The U.S. Military Killed Hundreds of Thousands of Japanese Civilians
   with Napalm from 1944 - 1945
   10, chemical, weapons, attacks, washington, doesnt, want, you, to,
   talk, about,

   Napalm is a sticky and highly flammable gel which has been used as a
   weapon of terror by the U.S. military. In 1980, [41]the UN declared the
   use of napalm on swaths of civilian population a war crime. That's
   [42]exactly what the U.S. military did in World War II, dropping enough
   napalm in one bombing raid on Tokyo to burn 100,000 people to death,
   injure a million more, and leave a million without homes in the single
   deadliest air raid of World War II.
   10. The U.S. Government Dropped Nuclear Bombs on Two Japanese Cities in
   1945
   10, chemical, weapons, attacks, washington, doesnt, want, you, to,
   talk, about,

   Although nuclear bombs may not be considered chemical weapons, I
   believe we can agree they belong to the same category. They certainly
   disperse an awful lot of deadly radioactive chemicals. They are every
   bit as horrifying as chemical weapons if not more, and by their very
   nature, suitable for only one purpose: wiping out an entire city full
   of civilians. It seems odd that the only regime to ever [43]use one of
   these weapons of terror on other human beings has busied itself with
   the pretense of keeping the world safe from dangerous weapons in the
   hands of dangerous governments.
