Page Program

   The Page Program offers students the opportunity to work part time in
   various locations and areas of the library. The program provides
   invaluable work experiences and flexible work schedules. Pages, Senior
   Pages and Computer Pages have a variety of responsibilities such as
   shelving books, providing customer service, assisting patrons with
   technology and other administrative duties.

   To be eligible for any Page position, a candidate must be enrolled as a
   student in an approved degree program at an accredited educational
   institution.

Librarian Trainee Program

   The Librarian Trainee Program, unique to the Sites and Services area of
   The New York Public Library, is designed for the master's level library
   school student who wants practical experience in a large, diversified,
   and urban library system.

   The program provides exposure to public service, community outreach
   programs, and collection development.  This practical training in
   public librarianship complements the academic education received from
   library school.

   To be eligible for a position as a Librarian Trainee, a candidate must
   be enrolled and matriculated at a Library school accredited by the
   American Library Association.

Internships

   The New York Public Library has long served as a learning organization
   for students interested in careers in a wide variety of departments at
   the Library. At NYPL, interns have the chance to work with world-class
   collections and experts in their respective fields. The Library
   provides unique learning opportunities for students with the hope that
   these relationships will blossom into long-term employment with NYPL.

   The Library offers both summer as well as school year based
   internships. These can range from full time to part time, and are all
   unpaid. All applications must be submitted online.
