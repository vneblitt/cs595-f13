Ticket to Work: Advancing Employment Opportunities for People with
Disabilities

   By the Ticket to Work Team

   July 26th marks the 23rd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities
   Act (ADA). This landmark civil rights legislation guarantees equal
   opportunity for individuals with disabilities in employment, state and
   local government services, public accommodations, transportation and
   telecommunications.

   With respect to employment, the ADA assures that people with
   disabilities have an equal chance to become and stay employed in two
   key ways:
     * It prohibits employers from discriminating against anyone on the
       basis of disability in their hiring or employment practices.
     * It holds employers responsible for providing workers with
       disabilities reasonable accommodations in the workplace.

   The [56]unemployment rate for people with disabilities continues to
   decrease, and government programs, like Ticket to Work, may be the
   answer for those individuals who receive Social Security disability
   benefits but want to make more money through work.

   In 1999, the Ticket to Work program was established to advance
   employment opportunities for Social Security beneficiaries with
   disabilities.  The [57]program, along with special rules called Work
   Incentives, provide support and resources to help with the transition
   from disability benefits to employment and financial independence.
   Since the passage of the ADA, the U.S. [58]Equal Employment Opportunity
   Commission (EEOC) has been the primary authority on investigating and
   enforcing ADA protections.

   To celebrate the anniversary of the ADA, the EEOC will join Ticket to
   Work to host a national Work Incentive Seminar Event (WISE) Webinar
   about disability rights in the workplace on Wednesday, July 24th at 3
   p.m. EDT.  The WISE webinar,"[59]Ticket to Work and the Equal
   Employment Opportunity Commission: Know Your Rights and
   Responsibilities," will explain the EEOC's role in enforcing employment
   laws, the protections of the ADA, and Ticket to Work and Work
   Incentives career development and support services.

   The event is free and you may register [60]online or by phone at
   1-866-968-7842 (V) or 1-866-833-2967 (TTY)!

   Following the event, we will host a [61]Facebook Questions and Answers
   (Q&A) session and you will have a chance to have your questions
   answered by the experts.
