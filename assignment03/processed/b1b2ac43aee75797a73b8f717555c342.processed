                              Suited for Space

    MH-5: First MOL Training Configuration; Hamilton Standard, 1967. The
     history of this country is one of perilous voyages and unchartered
   territory, but few journeys have captured the imagination and hearts of
    the public as the race into space. It was seemingly unattainable, but
    American ingenuity, innovation, and determination made the impossible
   possible. And it is that ingenuity and innovation that is explored and
              celebrated in the SITES exhibit Suited for Space.

     Through rare and original photography, including unique, new x-ray
   images of the interiors of the spacesuits, the exhibit reveals how the
   modern technological marvel that is the spacesuit enables astronauts to
   live and work in space. This exhibit reveals the remarkable creativity
   and determination of the extraordinary few who ventured into space, but
     it highlights and showcases the brilliant ingenuity of the hundreds
    more who worked tirelessly--and often anonymously--to get them there.

   In May 1961, when President Kennedy made the promise that America would
     put a man on the moon within a decade, the ability to fulfill that
    promise existed only in theory. The spacesuit was a critical piece of
   engineering that allowed Neil Armstrong to step onto another world and
   survive in the hostile environment of outer space. The Apollo spacesuit
     he wore evolved from the groundbreaking advances of the Gemini and
     Mercury mission suits, facilitating movement and dexterity in small
   spaces, remaining pressurized in zero gravity, and providing essential
     oxygen, heating, and cooling in as efficient a manner as possible.

       The national exhibition tour is generously supported by DuPont.

      Spacesuits That Helped Launch the American Space Program Explored
                        in New Smithsonian Exhibition

   In 1961, President John F. Kennedy stated the United States would land
   a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth before the end of the
   decade. To achieve this ambitious goal, astronauts would need not only
     a spacecraft to launch them safely into space, but a spacesuit that
    would protect them as well. Without the proper clothing to keep them
    alive while traveling, living and working beyond the bonds of Earth,
                     space exploration was not possible.

     Suited for Space, a new exhibition from the Smithsonian Institution
     Traveling Exhibition (SITES) and the Smithsonian's National Air and
   Space Museum, explores the evolution of spacesuit development from the
    first quarter of the 20th century until the dawn of the shuttle era.

   Suited for Space will premiere at the Museum of Science and Industry in
      Chicago April 6. It will remain on view through Sept. 25 and will
       continue on an 11-city national tour through 2015. The national
         exhibition tour of Suited for Space is supported by DuPont.

      The exhibition features large-scale photographs of suits worn by
    astronauts from Project Mercury through the Skylab program as well as
   suits used in testing and training. The photographs featured in Suited
       for Space were taken by Smithsonian photographer Mark Avino. In
    addition, Avino, in collaboration with Ronald Cunningham produced new
       X-ray images that provide a unique view of the interiors of the
   spacesuits. While the fragility of these spacesuits prevents them from
    traveling, the exhibition will feature a replica Apollo spacesuit on
   loan from NASA and 10 objects from the National Air and Space Museum's
   collection, including a glove, a boot and helmets. Avino's photographs
      provide a visual timeline of the spacesuits' development over the
                                   years.
    Suited for Space includes suits that made history--like the one Buzz
    Aldrin wore on the Moon--and those that never left the ground such as
    the Mark V spacesuit designed for Project Mercury. The design of the
     Mark V suit included an over-sized shoulder joint that provided an
     expanded level of mobility. However, with three astronauts sitting
    side-by-side in a capsule the size of the front seat of a small car,
     the suit was not feasible for the Apollo mission. A visitor to the
      exhibition can see an exciting visual timeline of the spacesuits'
      evolution over the years. In addition, the exhibition has its own
    Facebook page for space trivia, curatorial insight, and general fun.

     The National Air and Space Museum building on the National Mall in
    Washington, D.C., is located at Sixth Street and Independence Avenue
   S.W. The museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center is located in Chantilly,
   Va., near Washington Dulles International Airport. Both facilities are
   open daily from 10 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. (closed Dec. 25). Admission is
     free, but there is a $15 fee for parking at the Udvar-Hazy Center.

      SITES has been sharing the wealth of Smithsonian collections and
   research programs with millions of people outside Washington, D.C., for
    more than 60 years. SITES connects Americans to their shared cultural
     heritage through a wide range of exhibitions about art, science and
        history, which are shown wherever people live, work and play.
