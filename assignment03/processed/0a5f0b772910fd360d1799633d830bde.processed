   Published on Aug 26, 2013

   Secretary Ernest Moniz: This really is the continuation of a very, very
   strong partnership as we address Sandy, address the state's needs and
   those in fact of the region and as we'll discuss today moving forward a
   project that we think will be a model actually for developing 21st
   century grid in a way that helps our economy but also helps our
   resilience.
   Governor Christie: The Northeast can lead the way on this. We can show
   that this type of grid for the first time can be used outside of the
   military context and I think that can encourage other folks who are
   concerned for other reasons about the resilience of their own system to
   be able to look at what we've done and be able to emulate it. I hope
   that as the Secretary said, no one would have wished that we would have
   gotten to this option in this way but now that we have let's try to
   make the best of it and to try to improve the lives of the people in
   this region who have been damaged by the storm.
