Back to School

   September 13, 2013 by [14]Erin Allen

   (The following is the cover story written by Stephen Wesson,
   educational resource specialist in the Educational Outreach Division of
   the Office of Strategic Initiatives, for the September-October 2013
   edition of the Library of Congress Magazine. You can download the issue
   in its entiretyÂ [15]here.)Â

   Teachers and students are discovering new ways of learning with
   resources from the Library of Congress.Â

   Fourth-grade students enjoy looking for clues in historic maps.
   Educational Outreach Division.

   Students in the Bronx pore over first-hand accounts of riots in New
   York City in 1863 and mapÂ them to neighborhoods that they know today.

   In Oregon, fifth-graders sprawl across a massive world map from 1507,
   searching for clues about what life would be like for an explorer.

   A Nevada middle-schooler finds original paperwork from the construction
   of the Erie Canalâ including a letter from Abraham Lincolnâweaves it
   into the story of labor and management in the industrial revolution,
   and wins a national history prize.

   These students from different states, in different grades, studying
   different subjects, have one thing in common: Theyâre all making
   discoveriesÂ using resources from the Library of Congress.

   Over the past two decades, technology has allowed the Library to
   makeÂ many of its collections accessible in classrooms around the
   world, helping teachers and students to explore a wide variety of
   subjects. The Libraryâs robust educational outreach program helps
   educators maximize this opportunity. At the heart of that program is
   the unparalleled collection of objects and documents that anyone can
   explore, save and use for free on the Libraryâs website, loc.gov.

   Bringing the Library into the Classroom

   Box to explore different features of the Libraryâs architecture. Photo

   The Libraryâs outreach to K-12 educators has its roots in the late
   1980s, when Librarian of Congress James H. Billington recognized that
   digital technology could be used to make the contents of the nationâs
   library more accessible to Congress, the American people and the world.
   In the 1990s, the Library began digitizing items from its collections
   and sending them to schools on disc. With the rise of the Internet, the
   treasures of the Library, andÂ its expertise, could be available to an
   even wider audience. The possibilities for teachers and students
   wereâand areâtremendous.

   However, these technologies bring new challengesÂ as well. Students
   need the skills that will allow them to navigate a crowded information
   marketplace, and the skills to prepare them to be effective
   21st-century citizens. Meanwhile, teachers need materials and
   strategies to engage students and provide them with opportunities to
   learn and practice problem-solving, research and collaboration skills.

   In the current educational climate, primary sources are more important
   than ever. The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) require teachers to
   use primary sources in their classrooms, supporting students as they
   learn to cite evidence and synthesize ideas, thoughtfully considering
   each piece of informationâs point of origin. The Next Generation
   Science Standards (NGSS), a guide for the teaching of science,
   technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), also stress the value
   of primary-source analysis and research skills.

     âThe Library is playing a unique and vital roleÂ in supporting the
     K-12 community during this period of transformation,â said Lee Ann
     Potter, the Libraryâs director of Educational Outreach. âAs the
     worldâs largest cultural repository, the Library provides free
     access to millions of online primary- source items.â

   The Power of Primary Sources

   sources. Photo by Earnestine Sweeting.

   The power that these items bring to learning is that they are
   historical artifacts that were created during the time period under
   study. Primary sources are the raw materials of history and culture.
   âAs such, they capture studentsâ attention,â said Potter. âThey give
   students a powerful sense of history and ofÂ the complexity of the past
   in a way that textbooks and other secondary sources donât. Analyzing
   primary sources prompts students to ask questions; guides them toward
   higher-order thinking, better critical-thinking and analysis skills;
   and encourages additional research.â

   No matter the subject or era, thereâs something for everyone. From
   Thomas Edisonâs late 19th-century films to 20th-century soda
   commercials, fromÂ poet Walt Whitmanâs notebooks to the journals of
   scientist Carl Sagan, from Revolutionary War letters from Valley Forge
   to the stories of Iraq War veterans, the collections span the universe
   of knowledge, and offer a dazzling record of human creativity.

   An Online Home for Teachers

   The Libraryâs support for educators isnât limited to providing access
   to its collections.

     âWe are providing the nationâs K-12 educators with a treasure trove
     of free tools, professional development and subject-area expertise
     that allows them toÂ bring the worldâs history and culture to life
     in their classrooms,â said Potter.

   All this can be found at the Libraryâs online home for
   educatorsâ[16]loc.gov/teachers. The Teachers Page provides
   classroom-ready primary sources, along with tools and training that
   make it easier to integrate sources effectively into curricula. The
   site also allows K-12 educatorsÂ to interact and share ideas and to
   learn from Library staff members via webinars.

   The site offers more than 100 carefully prepared, teacher-tested lesson
   plans and teaching activities built around the Libraryâs online
   collections. The collections are all searchable by Common Core State
   Standards, state content standards and the standards of national
   organizations.

   To keep up with everything the Library isÂ doing for teachers, more
   than 25,000 subscribers receive the Teaching with the Library of
   Congress blog ([17]blogs.loc.gov/teachers). The blog brings
   ready-to-use teaching ideas and news to its audience via email and RSS
   feeds.

   Educators looking to build their skills can choose from an array of
   online, self-directed training modules or customizable
   professional-development activities on the Teachers Page.

   When in doubt, teachers and students can pose their questions through
   the Libraryâs online âAsk a Librarianâ service.

     âLooking ahead, we are energized by the possibilities that mobile
     devices offer cultural institutions likeÂ the Library of Congress,
     which seek to serve broad and diverse audiences, regardless of where
     they are located,â said Potter.

   On-Site Opportunities

   Teachers participate at an on-site workshop at the Library of Congress.
   Educational Outreach Division.

   Each year, educators from across the country are selected to
   participate in one of several week-long Teaching with Primary Sources
   Summer Teacher Institutes held at the Library of Congress in
   Washington, D.C. (Apply at the Libraryâs âResources for Teachersâ
   website.) To provide educators across the country with similar
   instruction, the Libraryâs Teaching with Primary Sources (TPS)
   Educational Consortium offers professional development workshops in
   various locations.

   Teachers and elementary-school students who plan to visit the Library
   in person should not miss the Young Readers Center. They also will find
   that many of the Libraryâs exhibitions offer special guides for
   children to interact with the exhibitions. Student groups in grades
   four to six can participate in the LOC Box program to âunlockâ the
   secrets of the historic Thomas Jefferson Building and learn about the
   Library of Congress and its resources. The program allows students to
   participate in hands-on activities designed for use by a team of
   students led by a teacher or adult chaperone.

   Anyone age 16 or older can get a Reader Identification Card to do
   research at the Library of Congress. The reader card allows the public
   to access the more than 155 million items in the Libraryâs collections.
