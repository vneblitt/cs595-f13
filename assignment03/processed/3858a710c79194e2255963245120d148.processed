   Identifies Clear Gender Gap in Physiciansâ Earnings

New Study Identifies Clear Gender Gap in Physiciansâ Earnings

   September 4, 2013
   By Doug Gavel, HKS Communications

   A discernible gender gap exists in earnings by physicians working
   across a range of occupations in the United States. That is the finding
   in a new study, "[70]Trends in the Earnings of Male and Female Health
   Care Professionals in the United States, 1987 to 2010," co-authored by
   [71]Amitabh Chandra, professor of public policy at Harvard Kennedy
   School (HKS). The paper is published in the September 2nd edition of
   JAMA Internal Medicine.
   Chandra and his co-authors examined a range of data over a 23 year
   period, adjusting for hours worked in order to avoid overstating gender
   differences attributable to choices made by female physicians to work
   less. The analysis provided strong evidence that female physicians are
   underpaid compared to their male counterparts.
   "Adjusted earnings of male physicians in 1987-1990 exceeded those of
   female physicians by $33,840 (20.0%). There was no improvement over
   time in the earnings of female physicians relative to male physicians,"
   Chandra writes. "Overall, the gender gap fell considerably outside of
   the health care industry but inconsistently within it.
   "The gender earnings gap for registered nurses and pharmacists was
   smaller than for physicians and workers overall, and it fell over time.
   For dentists, physician assistants, and health care executives, the
   gender gap was greater than for workers in a non-health care occupation
   and fell consistently only for health care executives," he argues.
   The lessons for policymakers are evident, Chandra says.
   "While it is important to study gender differences in earnings after
   accounting for factors such as specialty choice and practice type, it
   is equally important to understand overall unadjusted gender
   differences in earnings. We performed the latter study," he writes.
   "This is because specialty and practice choices may be due to not only
   preferences of female physicians but also unequal opportunities. For
   example, are unadjusted earnings differences between male and female
   physicians due to a preference of female physicians for lower-paying
   specialties (eg, pediatrics or primary care) or do female physicians
   have less opportunity to enter higher paying specialties despite having
   similar preferences as male physicians? The etiology of the persistent
   gender gap in physician earnings is unknown and merits further
   consideration."
   Amitabh Chandra is an economist and professor of public policy at
   Harvard Kennedy School, where he also Director of PhD Admissions and
   Area Chair for Social and Urban Policy. He is a member of the
   Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) Panel of Health Advisors, and is a
   Research Associate at the IZA Institute in Bonn, Germany and at the
   National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). His research focuses on
   productivity and cost-growth in healthcare, medical malpractice, and
   racial disparities in healthcare.
