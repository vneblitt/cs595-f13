[8]Podcast #51 - The Return of Coding Horror

   08-05-13 by [9]Alex Miller. [10]18 comments

   Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #51, with special guest [11]Jeff
   Atwood and the usual suspects Joel Spolsky, David Fullerton, and Jay
   Hanlon. Today's show was brought to you by [12]Pan-American World
   Airways!
     * We kick off the discussion with a topic not on the agenda... which
       is reminiscing about who used to prepare the agenda on the old Joel
       & Jeff podcasts.
     * Site Milestones! [13]Spaaaace is now in public beta, so you should
       check it out. We also closed the [14]India proposal, after much
       discussion about the possibilities for location-based sites.
     * Five years ago today (7/31) was the start of the Stack Overflow
       private beta! (It's also Harry Potter's birthday.)
     * We have a new feature starting this week: featured sites! We'll
       grab the most interesting questions from a particular site to
       highlight the things people might not be aware of. This week, we're
       highlighting [15]Open Data. "What's open data, Jay?" Glad you
       asked! It's a site for developers and researchers who are trying to
       use publicly available data to translate it into more functional
       systems. ([16]We make our data available, too.) We were reached out
       to by the contractor running [17]data.gov - neat!
     * We did a minor feature tweak: [18]a new privilege. At 500 rep, you
       get access to the Late Answers and First Posts review queues.
       Congratulations!
     * We're working on an Android app. [19]You can help test it! We've
       started rolling it out to alpha testers. It's mostly functional -
       you can view questions, ask, answer, comment, vote, and view your
       inbox. (Ben wrote [20]a great blog post about what he learned while
       developing for Android - you should read it.)
     * Let's turn to our special guest Jeff Atwood. He's got many
       honorifics, and Jay got most of them wrong. Jeff has young
       children, and our hosts have lots of opinions about child things.
     * So! Jeff's new project is [21]Discourse. Like Stack Overflow,
       Discourse was born from the negative experience of having to go to
       ugly, nonfunctional places on the internet because you have to.
       Jeff walks us through the process of refining this idea and
       creating the product and highlights some of its best features.
          + Here's [22]the link to Jeff's presentation at ForumCon.
          + Side note: Forums and chat systems are incredibly similar,
            with one key difference: on a forum, you type in a complete
            thought. In a chat system, you write in half-clauses, and
            maybe three or four messages together make a thought.
          + Discourse is an instant improvement over
            many commenting systems (as opposed to forum systems). It was
            never intended to compete with [23]Disqus, but that's how
            BoingBoing [24]is using it and it seems to be working well.
     * Jeff is [25]looking for three major partners. He's got two already.
       Listen in to hear the Stack Exchange exclusive on the third
       Discourse partner! (DISCLAIMER: there is no actual announcement.)

   Thanks for listening to the Stack Exchange podcast featuring Jeff
   Atwood! Check out [26]BoingBoing's forums or [27]How-To Geek's
   forums to see [28]Discourse in action. Until next time!

   Love to see Jeff back on one of these; looking forward to listening.
   Discourse is a phenomenal project that will surely replace the PHPBBs
   out in the wild. And as always, it's so well built.
   [36]Eric Siegel [37]Aug 5 2013

   That song at the end is awesome. Is that the Stack Exchange theme song?
   Ben [38]Aug 5 2013

   The link to Ben's Android development post isn't working for me.
   [39]hek2mgl [40]Aug 5 2013

   That's funny but not fair. To all indians: I love india (although I
   never was there).. You are very polite and nice people!
   [41]Kronos [42]Aug 5 2013

   Happy Birthday from Stage.
   Giri [43]Aug 5 2013

   One thing I am not clear is how discourse is different from these
   wordpress forums?

   Can startups use any of these features with limitations? I hope they
   won't be considered as small business.
   [44]ParokshaX [45]Aug 5 2013

   about India, that's not fair
   [46]Javid [47]Aug 6 2013

   @Ben. Works for me. Check again.
   onABoat [48]Aug 6 2013

   U should really put a compressor on the recordings to flatten out the
   volume spikes in your guys speak volume, also maybe turn down on the
   cut off.
   AlbeyAmakiir [49]Aug 6 2013

   Still want statistics on how the name of the last podcast affected the
   listener count.
   Thenrich [50]Aug 6 2013

   When Jeff doesn't like a few features in a software, the whole software
   sucks for him. Few forum software from years ago where you have to
   search your post to see if someone replied exist now. Nowadays forums
   email you reply notifications. Either lame forums use lame forum
   software or the host is lazy to use something better. Most forum
   software are free and open source.

   Even stackoverflow has a feature that sucks in my opinion. You can't
   post a question which might produce anything resembling a list of good
   answers. So no "What's a good x to y" type of questions. I questioned a
   few features on meta and got enough downvotes from meta sheeple to ban
   me from asking again (this was cleared later). That's another feature
   that sucks because it can't differentiate between abusers or someone
   who is just active and has ideas most people don't agree with.
   At least the stackechange people weren't hard headed and eventually
   introduced the "on hold" question status.

   As for the comment about clicking to collapse a non-interesting thread
   which Jeff says is an extra effort. Which is faster? Clicking to
   collapse a multipage thread and getting the next reply to your eye
   level or scrolling down.. scrolling down.. scrolling down trying to
   find the end of the thread? Yeah.. web usability is a subjective
   matter.

   The current forum software can be improved a lot with some basic
   usability enhancements. I don't understand why their developers are not
   improving them quickly enough.

   I wish Jeff good luck with Discource. Will it displace the current
   forums software, time will tell.
   rgripper [51]Aug 7 2013

   I also find these comment plugins on some third party websites glaring.
   The first seconds I see it thinking: "OMG! My avatar's here, I must
   have already posted something I have no idea why".
   [52]Lightness Races in Orbit [53]Aug 7 2013

   Ugh, just-in-time loading. I *hate* this. I HATE it with a firey
   passion. Ever since Facebook took all their photo and activity lists
   and replaced the pagination with a slow, buggy, never-ending stream of
   crap that I can't seek through at will but have to painstakingly load
   one "segment" at a time, even if I know that what I want is right at
   the end. Please don't be part of -- nay, encourage -- this horrendous
   trend, Jeff. PLEASE.
   [54]Henning [55]Aug 7 2013

   Jeff returns, and all of a sudden the deep, focused discussion that was
   great about the Stack Overflow podcast is back.

   Stack Exchange podcast's recurring theme "oh man, this is so bad, we
   cannot use *any* of this" never happened with Jeff. He was driving this
   show without being aware of it.
   [56]Jeff Atwood [57]Aug 7 2013

   > Can startups use any of these features with limitations?

   Of course, Discourse is 100% open source (GPL v2) software now and
   forever:

   [58]https://github.com/discourse/discourse

   > Either lame forums use lame forum software

   But nobody is upgrading all these "lame" forums and they seem content
   to sit at the old version basically forever. Another problem within the
   forum industry is massive resistance to any change, even a "minor"
   upgrade to a newer, slightly-less-sucky version of the forum software
   they already use.

   But do watch the first 10-15 minutes of this, if you can:

   Ortzinator [60]Aug 7 2013

   @Thenrich: That's not a "feature", that's a type of question that the
   community has explicitly decided to not allow and for good reasons. And
   abusers are accounted for because downvoting sacrifices some of your
   own rep.
   [61]online project management software [62]Aug 21 2013

   Unfortunately, cannot agree to you on Disqus. Never really liked it,
   not nice, not cool - just nothing. I like more vBulletin, interface is
   clear and understandable. Comments and the blog itself look cool.
   [63]mobile app development company [64]Aug 21 2013

   As for me, I prefer more Discourse that WordPress. And I cannot say why
   - it's how I feel about it. The post is nice, I'm glad you are back, I
   enjoyed reading the article.
