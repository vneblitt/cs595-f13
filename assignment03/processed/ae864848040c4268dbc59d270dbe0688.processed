At `tipping point' in fight against AIDS, TB and malaria, UN-backed fund
seeks 15B to defeat pandemics

   12 September 2013 - With a $15 billion investment over the next three
   years, the global community can make huge strides towards defeating
   HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria - saving both missions of dollars
   and millions of lives, according to a new report by the United
   Nations-backed fund to fight the pandemics.

   The report warns that if global funding for the three infectious
   diseases were to flatline, it would not only spark severe humanitarian
   consequences but would triple the $15 billion currently needed to bring
   the pandemics under control to lifetime treatment costs as high as $47
   billion.

   This figure is spotlighted in the report, Cost of Inaction, released
   today by the UN-backed Global Fund to rally world leaders to do more to
   rein in the threat posed by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria during
   the 2014-2016 period.

   "There are three compelling factors that make this a unique opportunity
   to fight and defeat these diseases," said Mark Dybul, Executive
   Director of the Global Fund citing experience, new scientific tools and
   epidemiological understanding.

   "We can make a transformative difference, and if we do not act now, the
   costs will be staggering," Mr. Dybul noted, backing the report's call
   for full replenishment of the Fund's resources.

   The report was launched earlier today in a special conference call that
   included Ray Chambers, the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy on
   Financing the Health Millennium Development Goals and For Malaria.

   As part of the launch of the report, Joanne Carter, Executive Director
   of RESULTS Educational Fund in the US, called attention to why this 4th
   replenishment of the Global Fund is so critical: "We are at the tipping
   point in the fight against HIV, TB and malaria and the ultimate goal we
   all share to defeat these three diseases is a very real possibility."

   "Besides the humanitarian and moral case for a fully replenished fund,
   this report makes the undeniable value for money and economic rationale
   for scale-up, now."

   Without the required funding 2.6 million people would be infected with
   HIV annually, according to the report.

   In addition, three million less people would be treated for TB and one
   million unnecessarily killed without treatment.

   The report points to the cost of $30 per patient to start TB treatment,
   which can rise to 1,000 times the cost for multi-drug resistant TB in
   the future.

   The report also notes that the consequences for inadequate funding for
   malaria would be 196,000 lives lost per year and 430 million instances
   of people having malaria at a cost of $20 billion in lost gross
   domestic product (GDP).
