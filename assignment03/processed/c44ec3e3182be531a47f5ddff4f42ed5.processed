   Seaside (Transcript Below)
   GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE: I said when I got my first full briefing
   before I left Trenton to come here I said to my staff I feel like I
   want to throw up, and that's me. After all the effort and time and
   resources that we've put in to help the folks in Seaside Park and
   Seaside Heights rebuild, to see this going on as I said at the top is
   just unthinkable, so I know how I'm feeling. I can only imagine how the
   residents and business owners in this area are feeling. My heart goes
   out to them. That's why I'm here to make sure that every resource is
   brought to bear to contain this problem, and listen, this is us, so as
   soon as this is over we'll pick ourselves up, we'll dust ourselves off,
   and we'll get back to work.
