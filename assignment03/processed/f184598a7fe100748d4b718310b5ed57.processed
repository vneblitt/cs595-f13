   By Corilyn Shropshire Tribune staff reporter

   11:12 a.m. CDT, September 16, 2013

   Sears Holdings Corp. said it that is seeking senior secured term loan
   of up to $1 billion to help reduce its borrowing costs.
   If approved, the loan would be issued under the Hoffman Estates-based
   retailer's current $3.2 billion revolving credit agreement.  The debt
   would mature in June 2018.
   Sears shares were trading up more than 3 percent on Monday morning at
   $62.51.  The shares have climbed nearly 35 percent since Sept. 1.
