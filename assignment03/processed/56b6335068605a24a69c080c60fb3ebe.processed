Retirement Estimator

   Retirement Estimator

How the Retirement Estimator Works

   The Retirement Estimator gives estimates based on your actual Social
   Security earnings record. Please keep in mind that these are just
   estimates. We canât provide your actual benefit amount until you apply
   for benefits. And that amount may differ from the estimates provided
   because:
     * Your earnings may increase or decrease in the future.
     * After you start receiving benefits, they will be adjusted for
       cost-of-living increases.
     * Your estimated benefits are based on current law. The law governing
       benefit amounts may change because, by 2033, the payroll taxes
       collected will be enough to pay only about 77 cents for each dollar
       of scheduled benefits.
     * Your benefit amount may be affected by military service, railroad
       employment or pensions earned through work on which you did not pay
       Social Security tax.

Who Can Use the Retirement Estimator

   You can use the Retirement Estimator if:
     * You have enough [122]Social Security credits at this time to
       qualify for benefits and
     * You are not:
          + Currently receiving benefits on your own Social Security
            record;
          + Waiting for a decision about your application for benefits or
            Medicare;
          + Age 62 or older and receiving benefits on another Social
            Security record; or
          + Eligible for a [123]Pension Based on Work Not Covered By
            Social Security.

   If you are currently receiving only Medicare benefits, you can still
   get an estimate and [124]Retirement Information For Medicare
   Beneficiaries.

   If you cannot use the Retirement Estimator or you want a survivors or
   disability benefit estimate, please use one of our other benefit
   [125]Calculators.

Important

   You cannot use the Retirement Estimator if you [127]blocked access to
   your personal information.

How Long Can You Stay On Each Page?

   For security reasons, there are time limits for viewing each page. You
   will receive a warning after 25 minutes without doing anything, and you
   will be able to extend your time on the page.

   After the third warning on a page, you must move to another page. If
   you do not, your time will run out and your work on that page will be
   lost.

Note

   If you turned JavaScript off in your browser, you will not receive
   these warnings. After you spend 30 minutes on a page, you must move to
   another page or you will be logged out.
