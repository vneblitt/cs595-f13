Wall Street remains highly unpopular five years after crisis

   By Domenico Montanaro, Deputy Political Editor, NBC News

   Americans continue to overwhelmingly dislike and distrust Wall Street
   five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing
   financial crisis, according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal
   poll.

   Forty two percent said they have a negative view of the New York
   financial institutions while just 14 percent have a favorable opinion.
   The remainder of respondents had either a neutral view or no opinion.
   That is the lowest rating of any institution included in the poll.  In
   comparison, 45 percent view President Barack Obama favorably while 25
   percent expressed the same about the Tea Party.

   The antipathy remains high despite record gains in the Dow Jones
   Industrial Average of more than 15,000 points, which is 3,000 points
   above than where it was when the market began its decline in 2008.

   Still, a majority of Americans - 52 percent - continue to say they have
   been either greatly or somewhat affected by Wall Street crises and the
   housing market over the last three to five years. That's just seven
   points lower than in the immediate aftermath of the financial collapse
   in October of  2008.

   Americans also remain deeply pessimistic about the state of the
   economy. Just 27 percent think the economy will get better in the next
   year, while almost half of the country - 48 percent - thinks it will be
   about the same, the lowest since July of last year.

   Despite months of slowly improving economic data, a majority - 52
   percent - disapprove of President Barack Obama's handling of the
   economy, his worst rating since August of 2012.

   Part of this is likely because of the disconnect between Wall Street
   and the job market. Recovery in the job market has happened at a much
   slower pace than the gains on Wall Street.

   Activists march to the U.S. Justice Department as they participate in a
   protest May 20, 2013 in Washington, DC. Homeowners and activists from
   Home Defenders League and Occupy Homes joined the protest to demand
   that Attorney General Eric Holder "hold Wall Street Banks that ravaged
   America's economy accountable."

   After the financial collapse of 2008, the jobless rate spiked to 10
   percent a year later - eight months after Obama took office. Four years
   later, that rate [65]stands at 7.3 percent - a decline, but not back to
   the pre-economic meltdown levels of unemployment in the five percent
   range.

   There was a small spike in economic optimism just before the last
   presidential election. In October 2012, a high of 45 percent said the
   economy would get better in the next 12 months. But nearly a year later
   and with the election season over, nonpartisan pessimism is back.

   With the [66]top 1 percent taking home more money than at any time
   since 1928, there is also evidence in the poll of the widening income
   inequality gap. More Americans consider themselves poor than 15 years
   ago, the last time the question was asked -- in boom economic times.

   Twelve percent consider themselves poor compared to just seven percent
   who said so in 1998.  And there are more people saying they make less
   than $30,000 a year - nine percent now versus five percent in 1998.
   But adjusting for inflation, an annual $30,000 today is equivalent to
   making just $21,000 in 1998.

   There are also more people saying they make at least $75,000 a year or
   more - nearly 25 percent say they make at least that much now, versus
   nine percent who said so in 1998.  When inflation is figured in, one
   would have to make at least $107,000 to have the same buying power as
   someone who made $75,000 15 years ago.

   There also seems to be a relative lack of confidence that those in the
   poor or working class will rise up out of their situation and into the
   middle class. Twenty nine percent of those Americans  say they think
   it's at least fairly likely they will become middle class in the next
   five to seven years. In 1998, in better economic times, 36 percent said
   so.

   Just 19 percent of those in the middle class said they thought it was
   likely they would fall out. (That question was not asked in 1998.)

   Republicans can take some solace in the fact that they have gotten a
   bit of an economic bounce with the economy still struggling and
   President Obama seeing his economic disapproval numbers on the rise.

   The GOP now has a 33 to 29 percent advantage over Democrats in which
   party's seen as better to deal with the economy. That's a reversal from
   February - the last time the question was asked - when Democrats held a
   2-point advantage.  Before February, Republicans had led on this
   question since Aug. 2010.

   Republicans also have a 13-point advantage on dealing with the federal
   deficit - 35 to 22 percent. That's a 7-point increase from February.
   Republicans have led on that question through almost Obama's entire
   presidency, dating back to July 2009.

   In Jan. 2008, just as the stock market was beginning its decline - and
   George W. Bush was still president, presiding over a ballooning federal
   deficit because of two unfunded wars - Democrats held a whopping
   22-point advantage. They were favored on the deficit for five years
   before that. Now, that advantage is gone.

   But Democrats continue to be seen as the party that is most looking out
   for the middle class. They lead on the question by 17 points and have
   led on it all the way back to 1989 when it was first asked - although
   this was the narrowest margin in the poll.

   Still, Democrats dominate when people are asked who best represents the
   values of the middle class. Democratic strategist and Bill Clinton
   adviser James Carville coined the phrase, "The economy, stupid." And
   the ex-Democratic president tops the list of those who Americans say
   best represents the middle class -- 48 percent said so.

   By contrast, just 23 percent say the Republican Party represents the
   middle class and 22 percent say so of the Tea Party.

   "The Republican Party is not on the playing field in terms of who's
   being considered as representing the values of the middle class," said
   Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who conducted the poll with
   Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart. "That is fundamental positioning
   problem."
