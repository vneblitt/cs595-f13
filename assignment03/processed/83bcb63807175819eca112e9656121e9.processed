Brain Awareness Week will highlight the wonders of nature's most remarkable
machine

   Brain Brain Awareness Week begins March 11.

   ROANOKE, Va., March 1, 2013 - Imagine a portable supercomputer that
   requires only the wattage of a dim light bulb to run and yet can decode
   ancient languages, invent fictional worlds, and distinguish friend from
   foe. The Virginia Tech community will be celebrating that supercomputer
   - the human brain - during Brain Awareness Week, which begins March 11.

   "Brains are profound enigmas of high performance and creativity," said
   [160]Michael Friedlander, executive director of the [161]Virginia Tech
   Carilion Research Institute. "All brains - including those of fish,
   amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals - are complex organs that
   represent pinnacles of the evolutionary process, capable of performing
   demanding tasks more efficiently and effectively than any machine. And
   each brain has evolved the exquisite adaptive capacity to extract,
   decipher, and act upon information in the world that is essential to
   survival."

   For the first time, the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute will
   serve as an official partner for Brain Awareness Week, an annual
   international campaign that unites the efforts of universities,
   hospitals, government agencies, schools, and associations to increase
   public awareness about the progress and benefits of brain research.

   The principal highlight of the local week long commemoration will be
   [162]Brain School, a public seminar series in which Virginia Tech
   Carilion Research Institute faculty members will offer an owner's
   manual on the brain. During four consecutive evenings, the
   neuroscientists will explore the hardware and software of brains, how
   brains make sense of a noisy world, how brains misbehave, and how they
   develop and age. Attendance is free, yet limited by space restrictions,
   so [163]pre-registration is required.

   "Brain School will highlight not just the profound functional capacity
   of the brain, but also its ability to adapt to challenges," said
   Friedlander. "And those challenges occur more frequently than people
   might realize. Taken together, disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's
   disease, traumatic brain injury, autism, depression, addiction, and
   post-traumatic stress disorder have a greater economic impact on the
   country and the world than any other type of disorder, and that
   includes cancers and heart disease."

   Other local Brain Awareness Week events will include [164]Mythbusters:
   The Truth about Your Brain, an after-school event sponsored by the
   Science Museum of Western Virginia; Brain Matters, a series of
   presentations at area schools; [165]Reading Your Mind: How to Decode
   the Brain Mid-Thought, a seminar sponsored by the Roanoke-Blacksburg
   Technology Council; and Food for Thought: Chefs Celebrate Brain
   Awareness Week, a challenge issued to restaurants to invent dishes with
   brain-healthy ingredients, such as blueberries, salmon, nuts, coffee,
   and chocolate.

   In addition, in advance of Brain Awareness Week, the Virginia Tech
   Carilion Research Institute will co-host a scientific symposium with
   Virginia Commonwealth University and the Central Virginia Chapter of
   the Society for Neuroscience on March 7 and 8. [166]The Labile Brain:
   Neuroplasticity Throughout the Lifespan will feature leading brain
   researchers from across the country.

   "We're looking forward to working with our partners throughout the area
   to celebrate Brain Awareness Week," Friedlander said. "It's a great
   opportunity to help share some of the wonder of the brain with our
   friends, neighbors, and colleagues in the community."

   The [167]Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research
   Institute joins the basic science, life science, bioinformatics, and
   engineering strengths of Virginia Tech with the medical practice and
   medical education experience of Carilion Clinic. Virginia Tech Carilion
   is located in a new biomedical health sciences campus in Roanoke at 2
   Riverside Circle.
