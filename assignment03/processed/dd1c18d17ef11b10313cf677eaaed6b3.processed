   The Global Fund
   [16]@globalfundnews

   The Global Fund, Huffington Post, Charlize Theron Africa Outreach
   Project and the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Financing the
   Health Millennium Development Goals and for Malaria have joined forces
   to harness the energy of the social media generation to call on leaders
   to commit to defeating AIDS, TB and malaria.
   The Story
   updates
   Defeat AIDS, TB and Malaria
   Be the Generation to Defeat AIDS, TB and Malaria!
   The Global Fund - leading the fight against these three deadly diseases
   - is the world's war chest to achieve this extraordinary goal.

   This fall, global leaders will meet to decide how much money to
   allocate to the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria through the Global
   Fund. It is estimated that $15 billion in funding for the next three
   years is needed to make a transformative difference against the three
   diseases. By fully funding the Global Fund, we can strive to free the
   world from these killer infections, and create a world where no baby is
   born with HIV, no parent loses a child to malaria, and every TB ward is
   empty.

   IFRAME: [17]//www.youtube.com/embed/fv3rAw4BxpU

   We need to let our leaders know that we can make a difference. Many
   people  saying the same thing at the exact same time. On September 24,
   world leaders who will decide on funding for the fight against AIDS, TB
   and malaria will gather in New York for meetings on critical issues. We
   need to let them know how important it is to support the Global Fund
   and defeat these diseases. We can be the generation that does it.
