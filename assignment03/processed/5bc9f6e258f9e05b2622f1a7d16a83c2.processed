   Scott Disick
   I Wipe My Ass With $100 Bills
   ... Here's Proof
   0916_scott_disick_instagram
   Scott Disick hates poor people.
   He also hates the middle class ... and also the barely rich.
   In fact, Scott hates all un-super rich people so much ... he posted a
   bunch of photos this weekend in what appeared to be a blitzkreig to
   mock them ... starting with the wads of $100 bills he uses to wipe his
   ass.
   0916_subasset-scott_disick_instagram
   He posted pics of diamond jewelry, expensive watches and wads of cash
   ... along with captions like, "Hello, peasant's is that u?" He included
   the hash tag, "f**ku."

   Sure it's tasteless. Sure it's crass ... but it's also kind of
   awesome.

   They day he hooked p with a kardashian was the best day of his life.

   Hey Scott- money doesn't buy you class, acceptance, real friends,
   manners, self-esteem, or love. You're an insecure mess and it not only
   shows its screaming!

   He was just mocking that douchebag 17 year old rich kid that is
   constantly posting photos of this sort. Jealousy is an ugly trait
   folks.

   Notice that in the first pic he's got the wad of 100s next to his
   face...so yes, he does wipe his "ass" with $100 bills.

   It's no worse than Floyd Mayweather setting fire to a hundred dollar
   bill. They are all worthless s*** in my opinion.
