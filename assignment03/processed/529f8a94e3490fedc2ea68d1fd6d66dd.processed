   Ian MacKaye, local D.C. music legend and [17]approver of Minor Threat
   t-shirts, will add NPR quiz show guest to his resume this October,
   naturally.

   The Dischord Records co-founder will play the WNYC-produced Ask Me
   Another, which usually tapes in Brooklyn, at NPR's NoMa headquarters on
   October 10 at 7 p.m.

     Along with the show's expert puzzle gurus, Ophira [Eisenberg] and
     Jonathan [Coulton] have prepared brain benders fit for DC's finest.
     MacKaye will join Ask Me Another to discuss his career in music and
     won't leave NPR HQ until he has answered to the show's puzzle gurus,
     who will drum up a special quiz just for him.

   Tickets for the event are $15 and available [18]here.
   Contact the [19]author of this article or email [20]tips@dcist.com with
   further questions, comments or tips.
