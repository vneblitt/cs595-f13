The Cleverest New Anti-Abortion Law

Will the Supreme Court strike down Oklahomaâs devious attempt to stop doctors
from prescribing the safest kind of medical abortion?

   By [11]Emily Bazelon

   Pro choice rally, April 28, 2012 An April 28, 2012 pro-choice rally in
   Oklahoma City. A chalenge to a 2011 Oklahoma law making it harder for
   doctors to prescribe the drugs used to induce a medical abortion
   promises to be the next big Supreme Court case about abortion.

   The [12]biggest-ever wave of abortion restrictions has been flooding
   the states since Republicans victories in the 2010 election. The canny
   genius behind these new laws is that they reduce access to abortion in
   the name of protecting women's health. The statutes are written to seem
   reasonable, sober, and safety based, perhaps none more so than the 2011
   Oklahoma law making it harder for doctors to prescribe the drugs used
   to induce a medical abortion. A challenge to the Oklahoma law promises
   to be the [13]next big Supreme Court case about abortion.

   [14]Medical abortions take place in the first trimester, and they offer
   an alternative to women who would rather have an induced miscarriage at
   home than a surgical procedure in a clinic. When the Food and Drug
   Administration approved a drug regimen for medical abortion in 2000,
   the hope was that the availability of the pills (mainly what used to be
   called RU-486, now known as Mifeprex) would make it easier for women to
   take them earlier rather than later in pregnancy, when they are safer
   and less controversial. That's a good thing unless you oppose abortion
   at any time and in any form, which is why FDA approval of medical
   abortion came only after a long and bitter political Clinton-era
   battle.

   That fight has now shifted to the states. Model bills, [15]drafted in
   particular by the Americans United for Life--the ALEC of anti-abortion
   legislation--have attacked medical abortion in a couple of ways. The
   most popular route is to require the doctor who prescribes the drugs to
   be in the room when the patient takes it, rather than consulting with a
   nurse or midwife over the phone or via teleconference. [16]Fourteen
   states have passed those laws, and most of them are in effect. The
   second kind of restriction requires the prescribing doctor to follow
   the FDA protocol for administering the drug. Five states, including
   Oklahoma, have these kinds of statutes on the books.

   Oklahoma's version isn't written that clearly. It either bans all
   medication abortions ([17]that's the position of the Center for
   Reproductive Rights, which is challenging the law) or it requires
   doctors who do medical abortions with Mifeprex to follow the FDA
   protocol ([18]that's what the lawyers for Oklahoma say). Last year, the
   Oklahoma Supreme Court issued a [19]terse opinion striking down the law
   as unconstitutional without really explaining why, or which
   interpretation of the law is correct. So when the Supreme Court agreed
   to review the case, the justices first sent it back to the state
   Supreme Court for clarification, [20]as Amanda Marcotte explained in
   Slate.

   What's fascinating and brilliant about the law is the requirement that
   doctors follow FDA protocol for prescribing medication. Doesn't that
   sound like a good idea? The problem is that it's not how medicine
   works. To act otherwise in the case of medical abortion is to treat the
   doctors who prescribe these drugs--and their patients--as some lower,
   suspect class.

   In general, an FDA protocol is written at the time a drug is approved,
   based on the available research at the time. After doctors start
   prescribing a drug, more studies come out, and they may well suggest
   that a drug has other uses, or can be better administered at a
   different dose or in a different way.  Doctors keep up with the latest
   findings and shift based on the accumulating evidence. This is what's
   called "off label" use. "It's perfectly legal and acceptable," says
   Susan Wood, a public health professor at George Washington University
   and former FDA assistant commissioner for women's health. (She quit
   over the Bush-era fight about approving the emergency contraception
   Plan B). "It's also common in medicine." The American Medical
   Association estimates that one-half of all prescriptions written are
   off-label, Yale medical school professor Nancy Stanwood told me.

   When the FDA approved medical abortion in 2000, it was already legal in
   18 countries. The standard regimen at the time was a dosage of 600
   milligrams of Mifeprex, doled out over three clinic visits, and only to
   women in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Since then, research has
   shown that it's safe to use 200 milligrams, given at two clinic visits
   and then at home, for up to nine weeks of pregnancy ([21]Here's a handy
   comparative table). The [22]American College of Obstetrics and the
   [23]World Health Organization now advise 200 milligrams, given up to
   nine weeks. According to the brief filed in the Oklahoma case by the
   Center for Reproductive Rights, "96 percent of all medication abortions
   now involve an evidence-based regimen that departs from" the FDA
   protocol that's on the label.

   The alternate regimen is cheaper--the drugs cost $90 instead of $230.
   More importantly, abortion providers say, it's just better care. "The
   FDA regimen is simply outdated," says Rachael Phelps, medical director
   for Planned Parenthood in Rochester and Syracuse. "It is dramatically
   less effective, has more side effects, is harder for women to use, and
   increases the likelihood of an additional invasive procedure compared
   to the evidence based regimen. Mandating the FDA regimen forces doctors
   to provide substandard medical care and is just plain bad medicine."

   If this is so clear, then why hasn't the drug manufacturer gone back to
   the FDA and asked to change the label? The first reason is that this
   drug companies aren't required to go back for re-approval of off-label
   uses, so they generally don't. Re-approval is expensive. And in the
   case of medical abortion, the [24]big fight for approval the first time
   around doesn't make going back to the FDA especially appealing. There's
   only one maker of Mifeprex in the United States, a small company called
   [25]Danco Laboratories that got started with money from liberal
   foundations and used to hide its address. (For fear of protests, the
   FDA didn't release the names of the officials who reviewed Mifeprex
   when it announced approval for the drug.)

   These days, Danco has a [26]website about Mifeprex with a number for
   the media to call. In reporting this story, I heard that Danco may
   actually be going back to the FDA for approval of the alternate regimen
   as an on-label use. I called Danco's number to find out if that's true,
   and got back this statement: "Danco promotes Mifeprex only in
   accordance with the approved labeling. Danco does not comment on our
   interaction with the FDA."

   Given that abortion providers rely on research data about the off-label
   use, maybe it would be a good thing for Danco to return to FDA so the
   label for Mifeprex reflects how doctors actually prescribe it. "Many
   people, including me, would like companies in general to go back to the
   FDA when they have new data," Wood says. "It would help prescribers and
   health professionals use their products properly."

   But the Oklahoma law, and the likely Supreme Court battle over it, turn
   on a different question (to which Wood answered with a resounding no):
   Should states single out Mifiprex for different treatment from any
   other drug? On a deeper level, should states be in the business of
   ordering doctors to provide what they believe, based on the best
   medical evidence, is substandard care? Only in the field of abortion
   does the government interfere in this way with doctors and their
   patients. Is that really what the Constitution allows?
