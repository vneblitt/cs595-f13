Illinois lawmakers praise Syria diplomacy bid, but have deep doubts

The state's 20-member congressional delegation is sharply divided on whether
to give Obama use-of-force authorization to attack Syria.

   By Katherine Skiba Tribune reporter

   7:02 a.m. CDT, September 11, 2013
   WASHINGTON -- Members of Illinois' congressional delegation voiced
   support Tuesday night for President Barack Obama's diplomatic efforts
   on Syria, but some expressed doubts that the regime of President Bashar
   Assad would cooperate and wariness over U.S. military strikes if it
   doesn't.

   In interviews and statements after Obama's prime-time address, Illinois
   lawmakers cited their constituents' concerns about military action and
   said it should be a "last resort."

   Illinois' 20-member congressional delegation is sharply divided on
   whether to give Obama authorization to attack Syria in retaliation for
   chemical attacks that the U.S. says killed more than 1,400 people last
   month. So far, only half the Illinoisans in Congress have declared
   where they stand or clearly indicated which direction they're leaning.

   Rep. Brad Schneider, a freshman Democrat from Deerfield who is
   uncommitted on the military option, said upholding a nearly
   100-year-old ban on chemical weapons was in the nation's interest and
   the world's.

   "I think it's imperative that we are open to the possibility of a
   diplomatic solution, but it has to be transparent, with realistic times
   frames and verifiable benchmarks for securing and destroying Syria's
   chemical weapons," Schneider said.

   Schneider said he would welcome an agreement that "provides the
   possibility of not just removing the threat of chemical weapons by the
   Assad regime, but dramatically reduces the risk of these weapons
   falling into the hands of groups like al-Qaida or Hezbollah."

   Schneider is no stranger to the Middle East, having traveled twice to
   Israel on official trips since taking office in January. He has been a
   member of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel
   lobby, since 2000, an aide said.

   Rep. Danny Davis, a Chicago Democrat who is leaning "no" on military
   action, said he wasn't sure there was any new ground plowed in the
   president's speech, nor does he know "if it changed the opinion of
   people who are opposed to military intervention."

   "I just think that people are war-weary," Davis said.

   He said he hopes the diplomatic efforts being discussed would work but
   doesn't know if Syria "will bite, will agree" to surrender its chemical
   weapons.

   Davis said his offices had "several thousand" calls about Syria in the
   last week, with most people overwhelmingly opposed to military strikes.
   "I'm not sure a lot of people in my district will necessarily change
   (their view) as a result of the president's address tonight," he said.

   Rep. Jan Schakowsky, an Evanston Democrat who is leaning "yes," said in
   a statement that "a diplomatic solution is the best way to end Syrian
   use of chemical weapons.

   "If that fails, we should consider the option of a limited strike
   because I believe the use of chemical weapons must be a 'red line' for
   humanity and that we must act," Schakowsky said.

   Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a two-term Republican from Channahon, said that
   while Obama made the case outlining Syria's use of chemical weapons in
   the first half of his speech, he "said what he should have said two
   weeks ago."

   Kinzinger said he hoped the diplomatic overtures to have Syria
   surrender its chemical weapons were serious, and that he had a hard
   time believing them. Asked to gauge the prospect that Syria would hand
   over its chemical weapons to international control, Kinzinger estimated
   the likelihood was about 25 percent, especially since Syria "is in the
   middle of a civil war."

   Kinzinger, a pilot in the Air National Guard who has flown missions in
   Iraq and Afghanistan, is only one of three Illinois members of Congress
   to have been vocal in support of granting the president the
   authorization to use force. The others are the state's two senators:
   Democrat Dick Durbin and Republican Mark Kirk.

   Rep. Randy Hultgren, a Republican from Winfield, said in a statement
   that "we are dealing with a rapidly evolving situation that requires a
   strong collective response by the international community.

   "I do not believe the president and his administration have made a
   convincing case to the American people that striking Syria with
   military force is in the best interest of our nation," Hultgren added.

   In a statement, Rep. Bill Foster, a Naperville Democrat, praised Obama
   for pursuing a diplomatic solution to the crisis. "The choice to take
   military action is one of the most significant decisions a government
   can make," Foster said, "and should only be used as a means of last
   resort."

   First-term Rep. Cheri Bustos, an East Moline Democrat, issued a
   statement: "I have said from the beginning that force should be a last
   resort and that it is important that we work with the international
   community in responding to the recent brutal attacks on defenseless
   Syrian civilians.

   "What happened in Syria is an unthinkable and horrible reality, and
   while I strongly believe that we must not tolerate the use of chemical
   weapons, many questions still remain before we can determine what
   further response is most appropriate."

   Rep. Robin Kelly, a Democrat from Matteson who entered Congress in
   April to succeed the convicted Jesse Jackson Jr., has not stated her
   views on Syria.

   Her reluctance to stake out her position is based in part on the
   fast-moving developments on the diplomatic front, said her spokeswoman,
   who also noted constituents' opposition to military action.

   "As most offices have been experiencing, the majority of people who
   have been contacting our office are against any kind of Syrian
   intervention," said spokeswoman Kayce Ataiyero. "We haven't even
   crunched the numbers yet."
