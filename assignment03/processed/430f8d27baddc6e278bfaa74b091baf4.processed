     children the value of tolerance and mutual respect.  Let us invest
     in the schools and teachers that will build a fair and inclusive
     world that embraces diversity.  Let us fight for peace and defend it

Peace Day 2013 Poster

   Each year the International Day of Peace is observed around the world
   on 21 September. The General Assembly has declared this as a day
   devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all
   nations and peoples.

   The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by
   [25]resolution 36/67 PDF document of the United Nations General
   Assembly to coincide with its opening session, which was held annually
   on the third Tuesday of September. The first Peace Day was observed in
   September 1982.

   In 2001, the General Assembly by unanimous vote adopted [26]resolution
   55/282 PDF document , which established 21 September as an annual day
   of non-violence and cease-fire.

   The United Nations invites all nations and people to honour a cessation
   of hostilities during the Day, and to otherwise commemorate the Day
   through education and public awareness on issues related to peace.
