   Fahrenheit 451 is Ray Bradburyâs disturbing vision of a future United
   States in which books are outlawed and burned. Even though
   interpretations of the novel have primarily focused on the historical
   role of book burning as a means of censorship, Bradbury has said that
   the novel is about how television reduces knowledge to factoids and
   destroys interest in reading. The book inspired a 1966 film by Francois
   Truffaut and a subsequent BBC symphony. Its name comes from the minimum
   temperature at which paper catches fire by spontaneous combustion.
