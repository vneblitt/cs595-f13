   D.C. officials said at least 13 people are dead after a rampage at the
   Washington Navy Yard on Monday. The U.S. Navy said shots were fired
   around 8:20 a.m. at the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters
   building, where about 3,000 people work.

[31]The media: A quick scan

   "So much was misreported in the first few hours after the shooting
   rampage at Washington's Navy Yard," [32]Paul Farhi writes in The Post.

     The erroneous reports weren't concocted. In most cases, they came
     directly from police sources, and quickly bubbled up through the
     modern media ecosystem, hopping from law enforcement scanners to
     Twitter to traditional media reports, all within minutes. Reporters
     are no better than their sources, and as sources, police scanners
     aren't very reliable.

   Jim Farley, the news chief at WTOP, tells Farhi that a scanner "is not
   a source."

     "Our main motto is first get it right, then get it fast. We'd rather
     be slow but accurate. The public doesn't remember who got what
     first. It does remember who got something wrong."

[34]Kenneth Proctor loved his boys and his Redskins

   Breakfast beckoned [35]in Building 197.

   Kenneth Bernard Proctor, a civilian utilities foreman at the Navy Yard,
   didn't work in that building, his ex-wife, Evelyn Proctor, [36]told The
   Associated Press. But, she said: "It was a routine thing for him to go
   there in the morning for breakfast, and unfortunately it happened."

   The high school sweethearts had spoken early Monday morning, before he
   left for work. They talked every day, even after their marriage ended
   in divorce earlier this year.

   "We were still very close. It wasn't a bitter divorce," she said. "We
   still talked every day, and we lived 10 minutes away from each other."

   He was, she said, "a very loving, caring, gentle person."

   After failing to reach her ex-husband by telephone, she drove to the
   Navy Yard, fearing the worst, according to The Associated Press. She
   waited about three hours with other people looking for their loved ones
   and was informed around 8 p.m. that Kenneth Proctor was among the
   shooter's victims.

   He was 46 years old and loved his boys and his Redskins. He'd been born
   and raised in Charles County, Md., and was still living there. He'd
   worked for the federal government for 22 years, his ex-wife said.
   They'd married in 1994 and had two sons together - both now teenagers.
   Their youngest, Kendull, is 15. Their eldest, Kenneth Jr., 17, recently
   enlisted in the Army.

[38]Eight victims identified

   Police confirmed the names and ages of seven victims killed in Monday's
   attack at the Navy Yard:

   Michael Arnold, 59.

   [39]Sylvia Frasier, 53.

   Kathleen Gaarde, 62.

   John Roger Johnson, 73.

   Frank Kohler, 50.

   Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46.

   Vishnu Pandit, 61.

   The Washington Post's Emily Wax-Thibodeux identified an eighth: Arthur
   Daniels, 51.

     For the past two years, Arthur Daniels -- grandfather of nine -- had
     relocated and installed office furniture in federal government
     buildings around the region. On Monday, he went to work inside the
     Naval Yard.

     He spotted a gunman running down a hallway in Building 197,
     according to witnesses. He and a colleague ran. They arrived at an
     elevator and frantically pushed the button.

     The gunman shot Daniels in the back, a witness said. ...

     Daniels's son, Arthur Jr., said the family was struggling to
     "understand why."

     "All he did was go to work," he said. "That was his only crime."

[42]Alexis: 'A 13-year-old stuck in a 34-year-old body'

   From Tuesday's [43]front-page profile of Aaron Alexis, the man named as
   the shooter in Monday's mass killing at Building 197:

     Those who knew Alexis in recent years describe him as a "sweet and
     intelligent guy" (a regular customer at the Thai restaurant where he
     had been a waiter) and "a good boy" (his landlord), but also as
     "very aggressive," someone who seemed as though he might one day
     kill himself (a lay worker at the Buddhist temple where Alexis
     worshiped). ...

     "He's a 13-year-old stuck in a 34-year-old body," said Oui
     Suthamtewakul, owner of the Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White
     Settlement, Tex., and a friend who lived with Alexis for most of the
     past three years. "He needs attention."
