WPFW General Manager John Hughes Removed From Duties

   Posted by [86]Jonathan L. Fischer on Sep. 16, 2013 at 1:03 pm

   johnhughes John Hughes, the controversial general manager of
   [87]WPFW-FM, has been placed on paid administrative leave following a
   two-and-a-half-year tenure in which he attempted to [88]overhaul the
   programming at the struggling community "jazz and justice" station and
   move it outside the District. According to several sources at the
   station, the head of WPFW's parent Pacifica Foundation has replaced
   Hughes with Michelle Price, who consulted the organization on [89]the
   station's move earlier this year to a studio on L Street NW and will
   now serve as its interim general manager.

   In a conversation with City Desk, Yves Point-du-Jour, the chair of the
   station's listener-elected oversight board, confirms the personnel
   shifts but won't discuss Hughes' removal from his duties leading the
   station. He says he's confident in Price, who began today as interim
   GM. "She can communicate, she knows what she's doing, she's very
   qualified," he says.

   In an email to the staff of WPFW and Pacifica, Summer Reese, the
   foundation's interim executive director, asks that the shifts be kept
   quiet--a request very much at odds with the station's proclivity to
   [90]air its dirty laundry. "I want to make it clear to all programmers,
   staff and board members that there is to be no discussion of John
   Hughes on the air, in public, in email, social media or in the press,"
   Reese writes, later adding, "If a caller calls in to express any
   opinion about John Hughes departure, including being pleased about it,
   the programmer should refrain from comment or agreement and simply
   thank the caller for his or her thoughts. It is very important that no
   public discussion of personnel matters occur. The less said the better
   as I do not want the station to potentially incur any liability because
   of public discourse on this matter."

   Neither Reese, Price, nor Hughes could be reached for comment.

   Price and any future leaders of WPFW face a bleak task--including
   problems that predate Hughes' arrival in 2011. In recent years the
   progressive station, whose format mingles music and talk programming,
   has operated under budget deficits of more than $1 million while its
   audience has dwindled. Its current fundraising drive got off to a rocky
   start because of problems with the strength of its signal that plagued
   the station for much of the summer and were only resolved last week,
   Point-du-Jour says. Add to that the low morale of its small staff,
   which is currently being paid for three-quarters time. A budget
   approved by the Local Station Board last Wednesday would return the
   staff to full-time beginning in October, Point-du-Jour says--but only,
   he says, "if there's money."

   WPFW also has to find a permanent home following its departure from its
   longtime studio in Adams Morgan earlier this year. (Washington City
   Paper occupied the same building.) "We expect to have some kind of
   movement in that direction once [Price] settles down," Point-du-Jour
   says. The station moved to its current, temporary headquarters in
   Farragut following [91]a failed attempt--spearheaded by Hughes--to move
   to a location in Silver Spring, [92]generating opposition among some
   WPFW listeners because the plan involved subleasing space from a
   subsidiary of radio behemoth Clear Channel.

   Still, the departure of Hughes should at least give temporary
   satisfaction to the coalition of WPFW programmers, board members, and
   listeners that have called for his ouster for nearly two years. For his
   part, Point-du-Jour says he hopes the situation doesn't become a topic
   of on-air conversation. "We don't want that," he says. "We just want to
   move forward."

   Update: Below is Reese's email to the WPFW and Pacifica staff:

       WBAI's Berthold Reimers is at least 2 1/2 years overdue for the
       same action.

       I vehemently disagree with this unwarranted comment made by Chris
       Albertson. Considering the terrible economic circumstances and an
       immensely burdensome work load, Berthold Reimers, WBAI's General
       Manager is doing an admirable job. I know whereof I speak. I am a
       member of the WBAI Finance Committee as well as of the Local
       Station Board. Berthold has striven to provide as accurate and
       transparent information as he can to those in governance. I am
       proud to express my appreciation for his steadfast committment to
       the Pacifica mission and to the survival of WBAI.
