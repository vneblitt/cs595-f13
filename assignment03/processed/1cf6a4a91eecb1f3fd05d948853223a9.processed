Cuccinelli and Obenshain Continue to Mislead Voters on Dangerous Women‚s
Health Agenda

   [17]Home ª [18]Blog ª Cuccinelli and Obenshain Continue to Mislead
   Voters on Dangerous Women‚s Health Agenda

   Last week, Ken Cuccinelli and his running mate, attorney general
   candidate Mark Obenshain, continued to run from their extreme records
   and hide their dangerous women‚s health agenda.

   Dodging questions and misleading voters has been an ongoing trend for
   these candidates who seem to realize that voters oppose their
   out-of-touch agenda that would¬ limit women‚s access to quality,
   affordable health care. That‚s why both Cuccinelli and Obenshain have
   tried to distance themselves from their own records.

   Ken Cuccinelli made [22]ridiculous, false claims that he doesn‚t
   believe government should interfere in decisions relating to birth
   control and that he has never supported such legislation. And speaking
   at the same place where Cuccinelli made his outrageous comments, Mark
   Obenshain [23]claimed that people have been ‚grossly mischaracterizing‚
   his record on women‚s health ‚ even though we know his women‚s health
   record is just as extreme and dangerous as Cuccinelli‚s.

   Not only have both of these candidates supported extreme and dangerous
   ‚personhood‚ legislation, which if enacted could interfere in personal
   and private medical decisions relating to birth control, but both men
   voted [24]against legislation clarifying that birth control was not a
   form of abortion.

   But we‚re not fooled.

   We know where these candidates really stand, and we will continue to
   spread the word on how disastrous they would be for women‚s health in
   Virginia if they are elected this November.

   [25]Join us and tell Ken Cuccinelli he can‚t run from his extreme
   record.
