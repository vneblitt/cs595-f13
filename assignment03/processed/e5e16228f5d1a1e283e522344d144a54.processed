   Here at EW, Fall TV Wish List is a new weekly series in which our TV
   critics Melissa Maerz and Jeff Jensen weigh in on what they hope the
   coming season will bring for some of their favorite shows. Today:
   Showtime‚s Homeland, which premieres its third season on Sept. 29.

   WHERE WE LEFT OFF
   "Maybe all this will end in tears," Brody (Damian Lewis) predicted
   during the season 2 finale. And that's pretty much what happened. (Then
   again, it's pretty much what always happens: Just watch the [46]Claire
   Danes Cry Face Supercut.) After Quinn (Rupert Friend) declined to kill
   Brody, Brody‚s car exploded right next to the memorial for Bill Walden
   (Jamey Sheridan), killing Estes (David Harewood) and much of the C.I.A.
   The followers of the late Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban) leaked Brody's old
   confession tape to the national news, implicating him (falsely) in the
   bombing, while also cluing in Jessica (Morena Baccarin) about her
   soon-to-be-ex-husband's past. And Carrie (Claire Danes) made her big,
   romantic, "I've decided I want to be with you" speech to Brody, only to
   have their celebratory snogging interrupted by a massive boom! and a
   run for the Canadian border, where she and her terrorist boyfriend
   parted ways. ("Goodbye, love!") The good news? At some point, Saul
   (Mandy Patinkin) actually smiled -- ostensibly because Carrie survived
   the explosion, but maybe also because Patinkin knew that he'd earned
   that [47]Emmy nod. The bad news? Now Brody will never get to be
   Carrie's cabin boy.

   WHAT I LOVED ABOUT LAST SEASON
   No Emmy-winning drama took wilder risks than Homeland did last season.
   And yet, many of those twists felt organic to the story, since it was
   told from the perspective of the biggest risk-taker in the C.I.A.
   Watching Carrie and her team capture Brody within the season's first
   four episodes was thrilling, especially since most writers would've
   milked that tension forever. And the mental chess match that followed
   in the riveting [48]"Q & A" episode was brilliant on all levels: the
   acting (and all the levels meta-acting, since both Carrie and Brody
   were lying at certain points), the whip-smart, zig-zag dialogue, even
   the way it was filmed, with the camera pointed across the table at
   Brody, as if we were the ones interrogating him, not Carrie. (When the
   camera angle rose to look down on Brody from above, it was clear that
   the power between him and Carrie had shifted: Clearly, he was in over
   his head now.) Episodes like these ask the big questions that make this
   show seem much deeper than its crazy,
   Oops!-I-accidentally-shot-the-jihadist-tailor-on-the-way-back-from-Gett
   ysburg! plot twists. At what point does plotting a crime become a crime
   itself? Is it ever justifiable for the C.I.A. to do unethical things to
   accomplish the very ethical goal of saving American lives? These
   questions felt especially timely, considering that this season's covert
   assassinations, government spying without a warrant, and drone strikes
   could also double as a critique of the Obama administration. Oh, and
   one last thing: I realize that we're supposed to believe that one of
   Nazir's henchmen planted that bomb in Brody's car. But the season
   finale raised so many questions about Brody's true motives that I
   wondered if he might've known about the plan all along. Why did Brody
   happen tell Mike (Diego Klattenhoff) to "keep taking care" of his
   family right before his car exploded? And why didn't he invite Dana to
   Walden's funeral -- he was her ex-boyfriend's dad, after all -- if he
   didn't think her life was at stake? The fact that I'm even asking these
   questions just proves how effective Homeland is. This isn't just a
   great drama about paranoia works. You already know how it works,
   because it makes you paranoid.

   WHAT I WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT
   The biggest problem with Homeland used to be the best part: Carrie and
   Brody's relationship. The idea of a C.I.A. agent falling for a
   terrorist might seem like ridiculous Harlequin romance stuff. But the
   first season made a convincing argument that these two people both felt
   so alienated from everyone else that they actually needed each other.
   ("Your past and my illness," as Carrie later put it, is what united
   them.) It started out as a relationship of convenience, and if they
   could use each other for their own political means, all the better. So
   when the two of them suddenly got starry-eyed for each other, even
   planning their future together, it didn't feel genuine, especially for
   two people who were willing to die (or, in Carrie's case, risk death)
   in the name of their ideals. Maybe Brody was faking his affection, to
   get the C.I.A. on his side. Either way, Carrie and Brody were far more
   compelling when they weren't so much hooking up as screwing each other
   over. Other problems: Dana and Finn's melodramatic hit-and-run, which
   set up future plot points all too conveniently. The logistical
   loopholes, including the fact that Secret Service didn't notice a
   suspicious car parked right in front of the C.I.A. memorial, and the
   idea that Brody could kill Walden so easily. (Aren't there cameras in
   the White House? And what bodyguard in his right mind would ever leave
   the Vice President alone with another person?) Also, why didn't the
   president die at Walden's memorial? Yes, it was a special, C.I.A.-only
   memorial, but you'd think that POTUS would've at least shown up.
   Somehow, though, none of this bugged me as much as one tiny, niggling
   thing: Why does Jessica call her own husband "Brody" instead of
   "Nicholas"? She's not on his frat brother. Brody is her last name, too.

   WHAT I'M HOPING FOR NEXT SEASON
   More Saul, please. His paternal relationship with Carrie was by far the
   most moving aspect of last season, especially when he left that cell
   phone message for her, his voice cracking, thinking that she was dead.
   Patinkin deserves that Emmy nomination: He communicates more emotion
   with his beard than most actors can with actual words. With Estes gone,
   Saul is next in line to be promoted, and now that his wife is coming
   home, his storyline should get richer, especially since the C.I.A will
   no doubt face a trial for the bombing that killed many of their own men
   and women. And Carrie will need his help, since she'll be [49]off her
   meds for at least part of this season. I've refrained from watching
   season three's premiere until it airs, but I hear that (slight spoiler
   alert!) Brody doesn't even show up in the first few episodes, which is
   good news. Now Homeland can scale back this epic romance to a more
   tightly-knit, character-driven, spy vs. spy thriller. Exec producer
   Alex Gansa [50]tells EW that the new episodes will be "a little more
   John Le Carr√©." How cool would it be to see Carrie and Saul play
   Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy? Considering his [51]fondness for
   suspenders, I suspect that Rupert Friend might make a great Tailor.
