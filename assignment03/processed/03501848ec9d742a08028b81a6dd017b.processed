Coffee and Cocktail Spot Coming to Fathom Creative Storefront in Logan Circle

   Posted by [86]Jessica Sidman on Sep. 10, 2013 at 10:50 am

   IMG_5282

   Ryan Fleming drank a lot of coffee in his former life working in
   finance.

   "I started out of necessity," says Fleming, who worked in New York and
   then San Francisco. "In finance, sometimes the hours are 80, 90, 100
   hours weeks and coffee is the only thing that can get people through
   that--the only legal way to get through that."

   But living in San Francisco, Fleming began to take a deeper interest in
   coffee beyond its caffeine power. "The more I explored, the more I
   looked, the more I was intrigued by how incredible it can be." He
   started taking coffee and food consulting classes, learned how to
   roast, and traveled across the West Coast learning more about coffee
   and visiting as many as 100 different coffee shops.

   Now he and co-owner/fiancée Miranda Mirabella, who works in health care
   consulting, are in the process of opening a not-yet-named coffee and
   cocktail spot in the storefront of branding and design firm Fathom
   Creative at 1333 14th St. NW. (Fathom will continue to operate in the
   back of the building.)

   "Coffee quality across the board has been rising up," Fleming says.
   "What we feel is missing is the service side of the coffee experience."
   The goal, he says, is to help guests better understand what they're
   drinking, beyond just knowing where the beans come from.

   Fleming and Mirabella are keeping a lot of the details under wraps for
   now, including the cafe's name and the specifics of their "unique
   equipment." In addition to coffee, the shop will serve cocktails
   (including coffee cocktails). There will also be light food offerings,
   like pastries and other small-plate snacks.

   Mirabella says they considered New York, Boston, and D.C. for their new
   venture "and this felt the most comfortable, and we were most excited
   about D.C."

   Fleming and Mirabella aim to open the coffee spot in early 2014.

       currently in New York. The moment I heard coffee cocktails... say
       no more, I'm on my way!! -Rebecca
