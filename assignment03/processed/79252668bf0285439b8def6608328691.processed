   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- On the first floor of Jordan Hall at the
   University of Virginia School of Medicine is a 12-by-8 room that, at
   first glance, looks like a rundown storage space. The floor is a mix of
   white, teal and purple tiles, in a pattern reminiscent of the 1970s.
   Trash cans are without tops and half filled. There are rust stains on
   the tiles, and a loose air vent dangles a bit from the ceiling.

   It is only when you see four incubators attached to six tanks of carbon
   dioxide that you get the feeling something more intriguing is taking
   place here.

   Inside these incubators Dr. Anindya Dutta stores cell cultures that he
   believes hold the key to a massive advancement in health care. He has
   identified the specific strands of microRNA, the molecule that plays a
   large role in gene expression, that are responsible for promoting the
   formation and fusion of muscular tissue.

   A look inside the incubator at the cell cultures being stored by Dr.
   Dutta and his team.

   The implications for such a discovery are tantalizing. People who
   suffer from diseases like muscular dystrophy would have easier
   treatments, and the elderly would fall less often and recover faster
   when they did. And so, as Dutta has me look into the microscope next to
   those carbon dioxide tanks, there is a notable hint of excitement in
   his voice.

   "If you can find ways to manipulate this muscle differentiation process
   it would do a huge amount for human health," he says. He explains that
   I'm seeing how myoblasts can be manipulated into becoming myotubes.
   Memories of high school biology class come flooding back.

   You wouldn't know from his giddy, optimistic tone that Dutta is
   currently navigating the biggest obstacle of his career. Five years
   after he received a $1.3 million grant from the National Institutes of
   Health to undertake this microRNA project, he's nearly out of cash. His
   proposal was placed in the 2nd percentile of all grants reviewed by NIH
   in 2007, meaning that it was deemed more promising than 98 percent of
   the proposed projects.

   When he asked for the same amount of money in 2012, his proposal was
   scored in the 18th percentile. In years past that score may have been
   good enough, but in the age of sequestration, NIH is supporting a much
   smaller pool of applicants. Late last month he was told that there
   would be no funding. UVA has stepped in to help, but Dutta estimates
   that 40 of his colleagues are in the same boat.

   "I am living off of fumes," he says.

   A feeling of despair has taken hold within research communities like
   Dutta's, Top officials at academic and medical institutions have grown
   convinced that years of stagnant budgets and recent cuts have ushered
   in the dark ages of science in America.

   "It is like a slowly growing cancer," Steven Warren, vice chancellor
   for research at the University of Kansas said of sequestration at a
   recent gathering of academic officials in Washington, D.C. "It's going
   to do a lot of destruction over time."

   If sequestration is a cancerous tumor inside the world of science, how
   far has it spread?

   In 2013 alone, NIH, the primary federal spigot for projects impacting
   human health, will be forced to cut $1.7 billion from its budget.
   Government agencies across the board are making similar reductions in
   their research budgets as well. The length of some grants have been
   shortened, while others have decreased in size and still others have
   been eliminated altogether. Though they aren't supposed to do so,
   university officials have begun siphoning money from funded projects to
   those feeling the pinch, in hopes that if they hang on long enough,
   help will eventually come.

   At the University of Virginia, hopes are wearing thin. After our first
   phone interview in July, Dutta ended the conversation with thanks. "I
   appreciate you doing this story because we need your help, buddy," he
   said. "We are in deep shit."

   When I visited the campus in August, he showed me how deep the shit
   actually is. Much of the five-room lab that he runs would not be there
   but for the grace of the federal government, from the $15,000 freezers
   and the $30,000 high-performance liquid chromatography machine to the
   post-doctoral fellows there on grants. All told, NIH funding for just
   the School of Medicine totaled $95.1 million between July 1, 2012 and
   June 30, 2013.

   With sequestration, all of this investment could be undermined. During
   that same time period, existing awards from NIH were cut by $1.9
   million. Dutta, meanwhile, has spent his days looking for grant money
   elsewhere and sending pleading emails to his congressman, Rep. Robert
   Hurt (R-Va.). But he has little to show for it. He's recently begun
   contemplating the possibility of ending his project altogether.

   Sitting in his office across the hall from the lab, with a few awards
   hanging on the wall and a single window looking out toward an adjacent
   building, he described his current situation as a professional and
   emotional low point.

   Dutta moved to the United States in 1983, after graduating from
   Christian Medical College, Vellore, in India. At 54, he has thinning,
   graying hair and a tiny bit of pudginess on his frame, of which he is
   acutely sensitive (he jokingly sucks in his stomach before every
   picture I take). He keeps a stash of Coke Zero in the corner of his
   office room. The soda makes him feel full during those long, busy days
   when he can't take a break to eat.

   Science is his overriding passion. As we walk among rows of beakers,
   centrifuges and test tubes in the lab -- with researchers, almost all
   of them foreign-born, buzzing about -- he glows over the advances made
   by his colleagues.

   He notes that last summer, with the approval of the Institutional
   Animal Care and Use Committee, his own team tested the significance of
   the specific microRNA strands on a group of injured mice. In one batch,
   they let the mice's muscles heal naturally. In another, they "sponged"
   out the microRNA to see how it adversely affected the healing process.
   The difference was remarkable.

   "In those mice, the differentiation was really poor," he said of the
   latter group. "What we found in these cells and culture was that these
   microRNAs were important for muscle differentiation ... Now, the next
   step is figuring out how to put the microRNA back in."

   Except he may no longer have mice on which to take that next step.
   Leaning forward in his office chair, he confides that if he wants to
   keep his postdoctoral fellow he may have to euthanize the mice to save
   money.

   "Isn't that terrible?" he asks. "Basically the mice are always the
   first thing you let go."

   "I guess you can't euthanize the postdoctoral fellow," I respond,
   hoping to lighten the mood.

   A few days later, Dutta tells me that because of the budget cuts, he
   had informed the post-doctoral fellow that he would be losing his spot
   this December.

   'WE NEEDED ANOTHER STIMULUS. INSTEAD WE GOT SEQUESTRATION.'

   In January 2002, President George W. Bush [286]unveiled a five-year
   budget proposal that called for a doubling in NIH funding. It was an
   unprecedented show of commitment to the scientific community that
   promised 36,000 new projects and major breakthroughs in medical
   research.

   In many ways, it proved to be a high-water mark. By 2007, NIH
   [287]funding had jumped to $29.2 billion, a massive increase from its
   $20.4 billion level at the start of Bush's presidency. By the time
   President Barack Obama took office, it had gone up to $30.8 billion.
   The 2009 stimulus package known as the American Recovery and
   Reinvestment Act put a significant amount of money behind scientific
   research as well. But under sequestration, many of those gains were
   lost. This year, the [288]agency's budget has gone back down to $29.1
   billion.

   NIH did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article.

   Over the past few months, The Huffington Post has set out to understand
   the breadth of these cuts. The roughly two dozen scientists and
   academic officials interviewed were naturally distraught over the
   impact sequestration is having on their own work and institutions. The
   nature of the business is to assume you're on the cusp of a major
   breakthrough.

   But beyond that, they shuddered at the damage being done to the field
   at large. Yes, they conceded, the NIH's budget remains large at $29
   billion. But without more investment, the nation's role as an
   international leader in scientific research is at risk. Moreover, the
   money being cut now will have lasting damage, both economic and
   medical, as cures to diseases are left undiscovered and treatments left
   unearthed.

   In the interim, the stagnant budgets and sequestration have caused
   researchers to go to extreme lengths just to stay afloat.

   Dr. Olga Gursky is among the more fortunate scientists working today.
   She received a $1.5 million NIH grant last month to study microproteins
   and how they can help cure cardiovascular diseases. The money
   effectively saved her lab at Boston University School of Medicine. She
   spent the year before it arrived surviving without one of her funding
   streams, after a grant she secured through the stimulus package
   expired.

   "We needed another stimulus," she said. "Instead of the stimulus we got
   sequestration."

   To cut costs when federal funding wasn't there, Gursky slashed salaries
   and began sneaking into science symposiums and pestering friends for
   guest passes to lectures. It was a humbling way to save a few hundred
   dollars -- one that reminded her of the climate she experienced in 1988
   when, armed with an MS in physics from Moscow State University, she
   fled the Soviet Union as a political refugee.

   "I have seen this movie before, and I would hate to see it happen in
   America," she said in a still-thick Russian accent. "The trends I have
   observing here ... compounded by the effects of sequestration, I
   believe is eerily reminiscent."

   Sneaking into conferences is one way to stick to a budget. Another
   tactic is to look to private funding to help fill the void.

   On Aug. 8, Steve Wynn, the billionaire chairman of hotel chain Wynn
   Resorts, [289]announced he would donate $25 million to the University
   of Iowa to study cures for rare eye diseases. Researchers were
   grateful. But they noted that such funding streams are unpredictable.
   Wynn is supporting the university's Institute for Vision Research in
   large part because he suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, and there is
   only a finite universe of wealthy philanthropists out there to help
   combat diseases from which they personally suffer.

   For-profit companies can play a role too. But they are much more likely
   to support projects with a clear return on investment, leaving
   explorative research like that [290]being done by Dr. William Jackson
   at the Medical College of Wisconsin in the lurch.

   Since 2007, Jackson has studied how viruses create a pool of membranes
   inside a cell. He hypothesized that viruses went into these "acidic
   vessels" in order to turn the cell into a factory for other viruses,
   meaning that if he could stop the development of these membrane pools,
   he could stop the spread of the virus itself. Most promisingly, he
   found that chloroquine, which is used to fight malaria, could be used
   to disrupt this process.

   Despite the potential ramifications of such a finding -- everything
   from the common cold to foot-and-mouth disease is thought to follow
   this pattern -- the private sector won't fund the work. "There is no
   money to be made from chloroquine," Jackson said. "Only if the drug
   companies found something they could copyright or patent would they do
   it."

   So Jackson is leaning on public funds. He applied for an NIH grant in
   February and it was reviewed in June, but the NIH won't give him a
   final answer until Congress settles on a budget this fall. Right now,
   he has $235,000 in "bridge" money to get him to next summer. If nothing
   changes and the grant application is declined, his lab will close.

   "Medical research is not like building widgets. We cannot turn it on
   and off," he said noting that, among other things, his staff would move
   on and his project would be tarred as unsuccessful.

   Without a billionaire benefactor or a private company to prop them up,
   some scientists have begun turning over the proverbial couch cushions.

   One of those scientists is Yuntao Wu of George Mason University. Over
   the past few years, Wu and his lab have been at the forefront of HIV
   research. His team has studied how genistein, a compound found in
   plants like soybeans, could essentially impede the communication
   between a cell's surface sensors and its interior. In this way, they
   believe it can be developed into a treatment for the virus.

   The work's been [291]featured in several top [292]scientific articles.
   But Wu's attempts this spring to get $100,000 to $200,000 in grant
   money from NIH were unsuccessful. He blames the sequestration, noting
   that he had received a total of $1.2 million in NIH funding over the
   past four years.

   To address the current crisis, Wu let go of his technician, stopped
   doing some research and submitted 10 new grant applications since
   February. He compared the process to scratching away at lottery
   tickets.

   Along the way, he took out a $35,000 loan to keep his Virginia-based
   lab open and turned to online fundraising tools. A non-profit
   organization called Day2 Inc. has begun a [293]charity drive online to
   help raise $35,000 to help him with repayment (a little more than
   $20,000 has been raised so far).

   "If I'm not funded in the next six months, I will be forced to abandon
   most of my research project," he said. "Some of these projects have
   been invested in for years."

   Recently, he's begun thinking about leaving the country for greener
   pastures.

   "I am starting to set up collaboration with Chinese researchers because
   the funding here dried up. This will permit me to at least keep some of
   my project alive," he said. "It has been very frustrating for me. I am
   in the middle of my career and the most productive time of my life."

   'TIME MARCHES ON AND NOT ALL OF US GET TO MARCH WITH IT'

   More often than not, researchers dealing with budget cuts that have
   been compounded by sequestration find themselves in Wu's predicament.
   Having exhausted all forms of cost-cutting and fundraising, they are
   scaling back their projects, contemplating moving or thinking about
   ending their work altogether.

   Dr. Roland Dunbrack, who works at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in
   Philadelphia, has been studying the design of antibody proteins in
   hopes of developing a version not seen in nature. The general idea is
   to use computer technology to configure antibodies to better fit the
   diseases they target.

   He applied for an NIH grant in February 2012 but a decision was
   delayed, first to see if sequestration went into effect and then to see
   if Congress could pass a budget. When NIH's National Institute of
   General Medical Sciences announced that it would be scaling back on new
   grants as opposed to cutting current ones to deal with sequestration,
   he knew he was in trouble.

   Dunbrack has adjusted. He hasn't hired researchers, outside of one
   student from the Drexel University College of Medicine who is working
   off a separate funding stream. And he's narrowed the scope of his
   research.

   "Basically, there are things I'm not doing because we don't have the
   money to do them. There is a kind of analysis of these protein
   structures written into this grant that I thought was very innovative
   that at the moment we are not doing," Dunbrack said. "This one student
   can't do everything."

   At the Washington University School of Medicine, Dr. John Turk has also
   begun downsizing.

   For the past 26 years, he's [294]been developing cultured cell lines
   and colonies of genetically modified mice for the purpose of advancing
   diabetes treatments. By tracing an enzyme to messenger RNA and tracing
   that messenger RNA to a DNA sequence that affects the production of
   insulin, he believes that in 10 to 20 years he could find a specific
   control to "retard or prevent the development of diabetes and
   associated complications of diabetes."

   Two of Dr. Turk's mice.

   But after receiving continuous NIH support, Turk now finds himself in
   what he calls the "worst funding environment during my career." His
   grant expired in July 2011, and while his renewal application listed 60
   publications in good journals, two of the three reviewers were not
   enthusiastic. His amended application, which was reviewed this
   February, scored better, in the 14th percentile. By then, the agency
   was preparing for sequestration.

   So he filed a new application that he hopes will get him funding
   sometime in the fall of 2014. Getting his department to pick up the tab
   until then is a difficult task. He's assembled what he calls a
   "skeleton crew" of researchers and redirected money from elsewhere. The
   previously inconceivable prospect now exists that he might have to
   close down his lab and euthanize his mice.

   "You would need a recipient who would be willing to assume the expense
   of caring for them," he explained. "We would offer them to other
   investigators. But few people are doing the research we are doing and
   everyone is facing similar budget cuts. ... Research that has taken a
   quarter of a century to develop would be lost."

   "Time marches on, I guess," he said, "and not all of us get to march
   with it."

   THE ONSLAUGHT OF BRAIN DRAIN

   It's not just projects receiving NIH grants that have been set back by
   sequestration. Various other government agencies have seen their
   research budgets slashed as well. [295]Early estimates from the
   American Association for the Advancement of Science projected that $9.3
   billion would be cut from research and development projects in 2013
   alone, including $6.4 billion from the Department of Defense.

   Tom Antonsen and Phil Sprangle, two professors at the University of
   Maryland, said they've experienced funding shortages from the Defense
   Department that could hamper their work

   "I can start off by saying one word: It's devastating," Sprangle said
   in a phone interview. "It's a disaster. I guess that's two words."

   Sprangle, an electromagnetic physicist, recently submitted a proposal
   to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to improve radioactivity
   detection methods. He believes that with the right breakthrough, port
   security screening and weapons monitoring, among other things, could be
   done at a safe distance of more than 100 meters away.

   "It's a totally new concept," he said. But it was not good enough to
   get a grant.

   "They have no money this year," he said. "It was put on a list of
   proposals that were scientifically acceptable and if money came in they
   would fund it. This is the first time I've experienced that."

   He's been working in the field for 40 years.

   The problem, Antonsen said, was not just how the lack of funding would
   impact graybeards like himself, but also the newcomers to the field.
   Young scientists who had spent 12 years studying for their PhDs would
   find the climate inhospitable, and future generations would look
   elsewhere.

   "We used to be able to tell people that there was some kind of job
   security," he said. "That would be a compensation for not being paid as
   much. Now, if you are taking a big risk in investing 12 years of your
   life to learn how to do the science, people will think twice."

   The non-technical term for this is "brain drain." It had been happening
   for years prior to sequestration, though the recent cuts have
   accelerated it. Antonsen, a plasma physicist who studies the production
   and interaction of electromagnetic fields with matter, said he has lost
   two staffers so far: one has left the country and another accepted a
   job at a Wall Street bank. A third is currently looking for work
   outside the field.

   Boston University's Gursky said that her program in Physiology and
   Biophysics had had no incoming graduate students during the last two
   academic years, while the overall number of matriculating PhD students
   at other programs had "dropped sharply." Dutta said a prospective hire
   in India had recently turned down a job offer in favor of going to
   Germany.

   "That was unheard of not too long ago," he said.

   One of Dutta's colleagues at the University of Virginia, Patrick Grant,
   an Associate Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, said his
   lab was down to two researchers from a peak of a dozen. His federal
   funding ran out last year.

   On the shelves outside Grant's office were old, empty champagne bottles
   from happier times. They had markings on them, noting student
   graduations or work being published in scientific journals.

   "I wouldn't advise people to go into science," he said. "I think it's a
   tough career to follow. It's not the career that I thought it was, or
   that it was for me a couple of years ago."

   REID TO THE RESCUE?

   Fixing sequestration's cuts to scientific research actually ranks
   fairly highly on the list of legislative priorities. Obama routinely
   touts the need to reinvest in the field and recruit new scientists. In
   April, [296]he proposed a $100 million plan to map the human brain.

   Support for NIH, meanwhile, has a rich bipartisan tradition, in large
   part because it's easy to recognize the important work the agency does.
   This past week, it was announced that NIH scientists had successfully
   tested, on a small group of people, a vaccine for malaria -- a disease
   that kills one million people a year.

   More recently, public universities have stepped up a lobbying campaign
   to reverse the cuts, with 165 professors and college presidents
   [297]recently writing to Obama and Congress, urging them to take
   immediate action.

   Perhaps most importantly, NIH has one of the most powerful members of
   the U.S. Senate squarely in its corner. Just one month after
   sequestration went into effect, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
   (D-Nev.) met NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins at a conference in Los
   Angeles. The two discussed budget cuts and rode together to Reid's next
   event. In the car, Collins laid out in detail how dire the funding
   situation was. Reid asked if he could come visit the NIH campus and if
   Collins, in return, would come brief the Democratic caucus.
   Two months later, in mid-June, Reid took the trip to NIH headquarters
   in Bethesda, Md. [298]He gave a floor speech about the dangers of the
   cuts three days later. The following month, Collins briefed Senate
   Democrats during their weekly lunch. A source with knowledge of the
   remarks said he brought up the prospect that the universal flu vaccine
   that is potentially five years from discovery could end up being
   delayed. He reminded attendees that 35,000 people die of the flu every
   year.
   But it hasn't been enough. No bill has been introduced in the Senate to
   replace the cuts to the NIH's budget. Meanwhile, the Democratic budget
   -- which would replace all of the sequester -- is mired in a standoff
   with Republicans, who want to replace the defense cuts contained in
   sequestration while expanding the domestic cuts.

   Reid, who associates say has been drawn to the issue because of his
   wife's bout with breast cancer, has continued to beat the drum. During
   a press briefing in late July, he brought up the topic of NIH funding
   again. And he's provided assurances to officials there and colleagues
   on the Hill that he will work on labor and health-related funding bills
   before military funding appropriations to ensure that scientific
   research doesn't get the short shrift.
   But in his statement to The Huffington Post, it was evident that the
   majority leader continues to see the politics of budget cuts as
   overwhelming the crisis confronting science.
   "I am working to find a bipartisan solution to reverse the damaging
   effects of the sequester, including the harmful cuts to NIH funding,"
   Reid said. "There's absolutely no reason why Republicans shouldn't be
   able to support funding for life-saving cures and treatments."

   England ruled 75% of the Globe at one point, and for doing so, it
   destroyed itself from the inside out.. It spent all it's money on war,
   and the illusion of "control" around the globe, and went bankrupt for
   it..
   Y'see.. All superpowers - eventually - tend to do exactly the same
   things to destroy themselves. They spend all their money outside of
   their own country and don't have anything left over to [330] Read
   More... Invest internally - They bankrupt themselves from the outside
   in - then they have to pull back, but by then it's too late, because
   some other country has become more powerful than the fallen superpower
   and it takes generations for the fallen superpower to repair the damage
   it has caused itself when reversing course..
   ..Because there are no longer internal "masses" educated enough, to
   come up with new technologies fast enough, to any longer compete with
   the newly created Superpower.
   Here we have prime example of History Repeating itself.
   You have half the country Pushing to spend our money on a greater
   illusion of "control".. And the other half of the country screaming
   "invest in ourselves"..
   Sorry... But looking at both spending strategies, throughout history,
   invariably, the end results for other superpowers practicing them have
   Always been the same..
   Those who spend their gold on the "illusion of control" have always
   failed from the inside out.
   So, I'm siding with History on this one. We need to invest Trillions in
   ourselves, not in China, Israel, Pakistan, Singapore, Iran, Iraq or
   Etc,. or etc., or etc..
   Just for Example.. Today.. Right Now.. China is investing in education
   and science, specifically to develop technologies for export in the
   FUTURE..
   We Ourselves, Right now, are cutting education, and investment in
   science which can Only hinder development of technologies for export in
   the Future..
   Basically... In the Future... We Lose!
   You don't have to be an economist to figure out where this country is
   heading, because, (luckily), you don't have to be a rocket scientist to
   do the math.
   Anyone can see where we are headed, all they have to do is look at
   history, and exercise a little common sense.

   I would like to thank all the thoughtful replies that identified my
   idiocy, stupidity, and general ignorance. I am not questioning the
   integrity, intelligence, or desire to do "good stuff" of the
   researchers. Research projects were cut by the agencies in the best
   position to judge the merits of the work. Some of the projects may be
   things we'll later miss but each was cut because an agency - facing a
   reduction of 5-to-7% of their budget - decided that such funds as they
   had were best spent elsewhere. Government spending has exploded in the
   last nine years. The anxiety and lamentations of those whose jobs are
   at stake is understandable. Most of those who wrote such delightful
   attacks on my earlier comment will not appreciate the subtleties
   involved but your anger and vitriol is misplaced if it's aimed my way.
   The sequester was a White House idea - for real - a tactic that didn't
   work as they'd hoped. The sequester was passed by majority votes in the
   House and Senate - only one of which is controlled by those
   reactionary, science-hating Republicans. The specific cuts were
   selected by agency management who report to Democratic Cabinet
   Secretaries. As you can see, I'm the one at whom you should be angry.
   There is one reason to aim them at me - and that is that I read them
   and am trying as best I can to respond. My hunch is that the agencies
   haven't - should you have contacted them.

   You are incorrect on how government money is distributed. The Agencies
   themselves do not decide who gets grants and who does not. There is a
   system called peer review where fellow scientists (who also write
   grants) review the grants of other on their merits. When grants are
   reviewed in such a manner the Agency establishes a pay line based on
   how many grants they can fund. and those scores are fit to the curve.

   Mr. Stein,
   Please thoroughly research your subject matter before you publish
   misleading information like this to Americans. Here are some sites you
   may want to look at the next time you are asked to write an article
   misrepresenting the facts to drive a political agenda: NSF (National
   Science Foundation), PHRMA (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
   of America), NIH (National Institutes of Health), FDA (Food and Drug
   Administration).
   There is an excellent article published by the Congressional Budget
   Office titled, Research and Development in the Pharmaceutical Industry.
   NIH also details their public-private partnerships on their site.
   The vast majority of pharmaceutical, medical device and biologics
   research is and always has been driven by private industry. Government
   funding only accounts for 20-25 %. The pharmaceutical industry, as any
   other industry, is profit-driven. Patent protection is essential for
   companies to recoup their expenses for research and development, FDA
   applications and regulatory affairs, scale up, manufacturing, quality
   assurance and control, medical affairs, marketing and sales, managed
   care and then all the other departments like HR, customer service and
   accounting. The cost of bringing a drug to market and keeping it there
   is staggering. If pharmaceutical companies cannot profit from a drug,
   they will not go through the grueling process of bringing it to market.
   This nation has generated medicines for the world because we are
   capitalists. That is not a dirty word, rather, that is why we are
   great.
   lprophitt: Mr. Stein, Please thoroughly research your subject matter
   before you

   I work in one of the labs mentioned in this article. Thinking outside
   of the box, why do reagents used in the lab cost 1000 times more to use
   than to make? Supply and demand just doesn't make sense here. 6 tubes
   of a seemingly simple reagent costs close to $1000. Tell me how that
   make sense? Let me tell you, scientists are extremely intelligent
   people with an altruistic nature to better humankind. Companies that
   provide us with our resources are the real leaches. Want to know where
   your tax money went? Look at the bonuses for CEOs of companies like
   Sigma, Corning, Fisher. Why are we paying $100 for a bottle of acetone
   (aka nail polish remover)? Because only one place can sell it to us
   through an obsolete computerized infrastructure. Science has become a
   business except that the most important people were left out of the
   plan....the scientists. It is so depressing to watch not only
   scientists suffer financially but their families as well. If you have
   ever seen someone lose their job, multiply that by 10 and that's just
   what I've observed one floor alone. We need help! I don't care where it
   comes from.

   If scientists were to focus their collective efforts on human-based
   approaches - and the technology is available - we would not be seeing
   treatment-only results, we would be seeing actual cures. For the
   record: Penicillin, that great standby of the doctor's arsenal, killed
   guinea pigs - only when the animal data was ignored and it was applied
   directly and successfully to the human patient did it take hold. If we
   were to base all decisions on animal testing there would be a) no
   chocolate (it kills dogs)! b) no aspirin (it kills cats) and c) big
   tobacco would have no opposition, as try as science might they couldn't
   prove cigarettes harmful to dogs forced to inhale smoke for long
   periods.
   I highly recommend you view the short film "Truisms" on the website

   and spitting out more so it'll be standing room only on this planet.
   We'll all be healthy, technologically advanced with no jobs, have no
   food or water and still scrounging to pay our fossil fuel bills to
   people like the Koch brothers. Experimenting on animals has to stop
   100%. Experiment on yourselves for the money you ask me as a taxpayer
   for. Pull the plug on all MY taxpayer money to fund any grants. Use my
   share to help fix the highways, get mass transit, no more fossil fuels,
   stop humans reproducing out of control and for pity's sake, leave
   animals alone and totally out of experiments. Inflicting pain on one
   animal to save another? Disgusting.

   I need not tell you, the experts on what is going on here. I'll talk to
   those who care though. The big pharma-coms are pushing to exterminate
   any project that will aid or prevent humanistic pain and strife. Money
   breaks down the fundamental thinking process of individual thought. It
   turns the rational state into pure mush when the word, "Money" comes to
   play. The government, both sides of the isle, are on the take. (There's
   no denying it you bunch of stuffed shirts.) If we want to bring back

   Hehe, do you honestly think there would be a paper trail? The evidence
   is in the pricing and availability of drugs. It is in the sheer numbers
   of people (mostly independent groups) trying to find answers... and not
   making news worthy breakthroughs; at least enough to say otherwise. The
   evidence is in the limited number of doctors who will step out of their
   norms to defend a legitimate drug or therapy. The big pharmacoms will
   never give a clean and decisive path for investigators to follow, that
   would be plumb crazy... now wouldn't it?

   Sequestration....ah, yes, Obama's plan.
   How many of these "scientists" are living off grants and are always on
   the brink of giant breakthroughs year after year after year after
   year...
