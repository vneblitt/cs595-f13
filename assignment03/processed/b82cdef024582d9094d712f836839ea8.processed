Exclusive: U.S. total of Syrian gas deaths could include bomb casualties -
sources

   (Stringer . Reuters, )

   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the most precise and dramatic details
   cited by the Obama administration as proof that Syrian forces used
   chemical weapons in an August 21 attack was the death toll, which an
   official U.S. government assessment put at 1,429 people, including 426
   children.

   The number, first released by the White House on August 30, was
   underscored by Secretary of State John Kerry in a fiery indictment of
   Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, describing videos of what he said
   were victims of the attack, which Syria denies.

   "Instead of being tucked safely in their beds at home, we saw rows of
   children lying side by side sprawled on a hospital floor, all of them
   dead from Assad's gas and surrounded by parents and grandparents who
   had suffered the same fate. The United States Government now knows that
   at least 1,429 Syrians were killed in this attack, including at least
   426 children," he said.

   Some U.S. congressional sources are now casting doubt on those figures.

   Three congressional sources told Reuters that administration officials
   had indicated in private that some deaths might have been caused by the
   conventional bombing that followed the release of sarin gas in suburban
   Damascus neighborhoods. This disclosure undermined support for
   President Barack Obama's plan to strike Syria, they said.

   A White House spokeswoman referred all questions about the death toll
   numbers - including a request for comment on whether controversy about
   the numbers was undermining support on Capitol Hill for administration
   policy - to intelligence agency spokespeople.

   "The Intelligence Community has a high bar for its assessments but it
   is virtually impossible to achieve 100 percent certitude," said Shawn
   Turner, chief spokesman for the Office of the Director of National
   Intelligence. "That's not the way intelligence works.

   "We are extremely rigorous in our methodology and we are constantly
   challenging ourselves to be more exacting," said Turner. "We have been
   thorough in our discussions with Congress about our methodology and I'm
   not aware of any concerns."

   One of the congressional sources said that administration officials in
   closed door briefings said they could not rule out that some victims
   included in the U.S. death toll were killed either by conventional
   explosive parts of rockets which carried poison gas or in the artillery
   barrage the United States says followed the gas attack.

   A second source, who is sympathetic to White House policy, said caveats
   administration officials attached to the 1,429 death total were of
   sufficient magnitude to cause the source to avoid citing the figure.

   A third source said that administration officials confronted pointed
   questions from members of Congress about the accuracy of the numbers
   and acknowledged that they "couldn't be sure" about the cause of death
   for some people counted as victims of chemical poisoning.

   An administration official familiar with the briefings denied that
   there had been any doubts as to how the 1,429 bodies were counted; a
   second official asserted that Capitol Hill officials had heard what
   they wanted to hear because so many legislators were opposed to Obama's
   plan.

   Administration sources told Reuters that they relied on a valid
   intelligence methodology to make the death estimate. An official said
   that it involved analyzing video pictures of victims, then eliminating
   from the fatality total any live person, any dead body with visible
   injuries and shrouded bodies showing blood spots.

   Classified intelligence tools then were used to confirm the provenance
   of the videos and to ensure that bodies were not counted twice, the
   official said. The official noted that U.S. intelligence had more
   resources to gather information than human rights or other
   non-governmental groups, which had smaller death tolls.

   "Nobody who has looked at the intelligence thinks this number is way
   off," a senior U.S. official said.

   "That's what the number was that day. We know 1,400 people were killed.
   As we get new information, the number could change," the senior U.S.
   official added.

   French intelligence says deaths from the gas attacks could be as high
   as 1,500, but it reported confirmed deaths from video evidence of 281.
   Estimates of gas attack deaths by British intelligence, the
   London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and non-governmental
   group Doctors without Borders fall within a range of 322 to 355.

   The congressional sources said that some members of Congress asked to
   see raw intelligence gathered by U.S. agencies. But thus far, the
   administration has provided only reports summarizing intelligence from
   human informants, electronic eavesdropping and satellite images.

   The Syrian government has denied launching any gas attack, although it
   has acknowledged it has such weapons and is in talks to give them up.
