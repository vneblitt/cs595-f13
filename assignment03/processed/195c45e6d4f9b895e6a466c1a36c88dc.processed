'Little Princes' selected as university's 2013-14 Common Book
     __________________________________________________________________



   2013-14 Common Book, "Little Princes," unveiled Daniel Wubah, vice
   president for undergraduate education, and Mark McNamee, provost,
   unveil "Little Princes" as the 2013-14 Common Book during a ceremony on
   Friday, March 1, 2013.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., March 4, 2013 - Conor Grennan's "Little Princes," an
   account of the author's trip to an orphanage in a war-torn Nepal and
   his efforts to reunite the children with their parents, has been
   selected as the university's Common Book for the 2013-14 academic year.

   For the first time since the [160]Common Book Project began at Virginia
   Tech more than a decade ago, the committee - which is made up of
   faculty and students - collected suggestions from the public online.
     * The committee received 180 recommendations.
     * Of those, the committee asked for volunteers from those who made
       Common Book recommendations to rate a total of 113 books.
       Volunteers included 29 undergraduate and graduate students, 10
       faculty members, three staff members, and one alumnus.
     * Using the volunteers' feedback, the committee narrowed the pool to
       10 semifinalists and then two finalists, ultimately selecting
       "Little Princes."

   "The book resonated with the committee," said Mary Ann Lewis, director
   of the Office of First Year Experiences. "We believe it transcends
   academic disciplines, cultures, and religious backgrounds while
   challenging students and faculty to think globally and to look for ways
   to make a positive impact here or abroad."

   The goal is for all students - from engineering to English majors - to
   discuss and learn from the same book, creating a common thread in the
   undergraduate experience.

   "Virginia Tech is strengthened by its breadth and depth of academic
   offerings and specialties," said Daniel Wubah, vice president for
   undergraduate education and deputy provost. "But we are even stronger
   when our faculty and students can build bridges between the
   disciplines. The Common Book Project is one way we are doing that
   through the undergraduate education experience."

   The Common Book is distributed to all first year and transfer students.
   Faculty members who teach those students are encouraged to integrate
   the Common Book into their curriculum through class discussions and
   projects. They may request a copy of the book by sending an email to
   [161]commonbook@vt.edu.

   The Center for Instructional Development and Educational Research will
   host "Incorporating the Virginia Tech Common Book in the Classroom"
   workshops at the Inn at Virginia Tech and Skeleton Conference Center.
     * Wednesday, March 20 from 1-3 p.m.
     * Friday, April 5 from 2-4 p.m.
     * Tuesday, April 23 from 3-5 p.m.
     * [162]Register through the Center for Instructional Development and
       Educational Research website.

   "Little Princes" is the university's eighth Common Book.

   The [163]Division of Undergraduate Education provides academic support,
   programs, and courses that touch on every aspect of the undergraduate
   experience, from recruitment to graduation and beyond. Its offices,
   units, and centers advocate for ways to create and nurture a vibrant
   and diverse community of engaged learners, while supporting the
   development of innovative and dynamic faculty. The division is
   committed to excellence in student access, retention, and success for
   the university's 24,000 undergraduate students.
