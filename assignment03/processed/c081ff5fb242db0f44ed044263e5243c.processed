   Tonight, Sons of Anarchy returns (10 p.m. ET on FX), and whether you're
   a die-hard fan who's forgotten [45]where the season 5 finale left off,
   or a new viewer curious to see star Charlie Hunnam (the [46]newly-cast
   Christian Grey) in action, here are five things you need to
   know/remember about the state of SAMCRO, which, newbies, stands for
   Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (the outlaw charter
   Hunnam's character, Jax, is president of). We'll try to keep this as
   simple as possible. UPDATE: Read [47]our season 6 premiere recap, and
   [48]our extensive postmortem with creator Kurt Sutter.
   â¢Â Why SAMCRO's former president, Clay (Ron Perlman), is in jail:
   There is no love lost between Jax and his stepfather, now that Jax
   knows Clay was responsible for the death of his father, the MC's
   co-founder who'd wanted to take the gun-running club legit, long before
   the series began. Jax also knows Clay's other crimes, which include,
   but are not limited to: murdering the club's other founder, putting a
   hit on Jax's old lady Tara (Maggie Siff), and orchestrating a series of
   break-ins that resulted in the death of the local sheriff's wife and
   unborn child. The crime Clay now stands accused of -- murdering
   gangster Damon Pope in the season 5 finale -- is the one thing he
   didn't do. Unable to kill Clay, Jax used the people he has under his
   thumb -- club members Juice (Theo Rossi) and Tig (Kim Coates) and his
   mother Gemma (Katey Sagal) -- to frame Clay for the murder knowing that
   Pope's successor, August Marks (Billy Brown), would make sure Clay dies
   in prison. Because of that move, Bobby (Mark Boone Junior) cut off his
   VP patch.

   [50]'Sons of Anarchy' season 5 finale recap: Jax got this?
   [51]'Sons of Anarchy' gets an aftershow

   â¢Â Why Jax controls Juice, Tig, and Gemma: In brief, Juice was
   blackmailed into turning rat last season, ended up killing a club
   member who could've outed him, and then tried to take his own life.
   Instead of outing him to the club -- only Chibs (Tommy Flanagan) has a
   clue -- Jax told Juice he'll now do whatever he tells him to do. That
   was also Jax's deal with Tig, whom he's bought a (temporary?) stay of
   execution. Tig killed Pope's innocent-bystander daughter in season 4
   and paid for it in the season 5 premiere by [52]watching Pope burn one
   of his daughters alive. The mess Tig started resulted in [53]the prison
   death of Jax's best friend, club member Opie (Ryan Hurst), and [54]Pope
   expecting Jax to deliver Tig to him. As for Gemma, Jax doesn't know
   what role she may have played in his father's death, but he does know
   she was high when she got in a car accident while driving his kids. He
   made her cozy back up to Clay, the husband who beat her (after she'd
   fired a shot at Clay's head), in exchange for access to her
   grandchildren again.

   â¢Â Why Tara is in jail: Jax's wife is a doctor, so she arranged to
   volunteer at the prison where former Son Otto (played by series creator
   Kurt Sutter) is on death row, so she could "treat" Otto and convince
   him not to help the Feds build their RICO case against the club. Otto
   asked for a crucifix that his late wife used to own, and Tara got it
   from Gemma and brought it to him. Otto then used it to brutally stab a
   prison nurse -- who, it turns out, was the sister of a former U.S
   Marshal who'd been given early retirement for using excessive force,
   Lee Toric (Donal Logue). Tara was arrested for conspiracy to commit
   murder in the season 5 finale. But who went to the cops: Was it Toric
   thinking Jax had sent Tara there for that purpose, or Gemma, who
   threatened to lie and tell the authorities Tara told her the plan for
   Otto when she asked for the crucifix? Otto, by the way, is done
   talking: He bit off his own tongue (which you will get to see again
   during tonight's "previously on" montage).

   â¢Â Why Tara and Jax are distant: The reason Gemma threatened to turn
   on Tara is because Tara wants to get her kids -- Thomas, her baby with
   Jax, and Abel, his toddler with his ex-wife Wendy (Drea de Matteo) --
   away from the outlaw life. Tara had just accepted a job in Portland,
   Oregon, and told Jax she and the boys were going with or without him.
   She also asked Jax to sign papers making Wendy the boys' legal guardian
   should anything happen to them. After Tara's arrest, Jax tore up the
   papers without signing them. He doesn't want his kids with Wendy, a
   recovering drug addict he recently shot up to discredit a story she
   could've told the cops to gain custody of the boys. That story: How
   she'd been kidnapped by the IRA, the Sons' gun supplier, which prefers
   dealing with Clay to Jax.

   â¢Â Why Jax's partnership with Nero (Jimmy Smits) is so important:
   Nero, who's now romantically involved with Gemma, was introduced in
   season 5 as someone Jax could emulate -- an OG gang-banger with an exit
   strategy, who just wanted to bank enough money to buy a farm his kid
   could enjoy. He left his crew, the Byz-Lats (which includes Nero's
   cousin, played by Dave Navarro), to handle themselves while he ran an
   escort service, Diosa Norte. Since SAMCRO's "legitimate" business
   résumé includes a porn company, Jax saw this as a natural opportunity
   to partner. But as Nero helped Jax out of multiple jams -- and as the
   Byz-Lats' territory was threatened, for which, and this is essential to
   remember, Jax gave the gang weapons to handle -- Nero got sucked back
   into the life.
