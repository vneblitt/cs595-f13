   Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is introducing an Economic Agenda for
   Women and Families. Guest host Susan Stamberg speaks with the
   congresswoman about her goals.

   SUSAN STAMBERG, HOST:

   Democrats and Republicans both tried to gain ground with women this
   week. Republicans launched an initiative to recruit female candidates
   for office. House Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, introduced an
   economic agenda for women and children. It's a series of bills aimed at
   achieving equal pay, increasing the federal minimum wage, access to
   childcare and early childhood education; something President Obama has
   long sought. Sixteen months before the next congressional election,
   Congresswoman Pelosi says House Democrats hope to raise enough public
   support to force Congress to make a move.

   REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: We are hopeful we can make it too hot for
   people to handle ignoring these women's issues and get something done,
   even before we get into the electoral season next year.

   STAMBERG: Yeah, but there is an electoral season and politics, of
   course, are always at the basis of so much of what gets done these
   days. How much is your timing - or your pressure or your focus on women
   - related to the fact that Republicans, too, are now going after women
   voters?

   PELOSI: Well, I don't know if they're going after women voters, but
   they're going after women - that's for sure. I mean they, the
   Republicans in Congress, are now trying to eliminate a $12 million
   appropriation for the women's small business initiative. It's hard to
   explain to anybody why that anybody would think that is a good idea. We
   don't want to make this a political issue but there is the fact that
   women are watching, and women want to see results on a positive agenda
   to lift up women in the workforce.

   STAMBERG: Here comes the inevitable congressional question though. The
   House has not been able to pass anything of late. So why would you have
   any hope for this series of bills?

   PELOSI: I would have optimism that we could make some progress on this
   initiative for the same reason that the Senate passed an immigration
   bill. They didn't have any interest in that until 70 percent of the...

   (LAUGHTER)

   PELOSI: ...Hispanics voted Democratic. And all of a sudden, they had an
   epiphany about the value of an immigration bill with a path to
   citizenship. And many of these things - while they do not have the
   support of the leadership in the Republican Party - there are
   Republicans who care about this issue. And if we had a chance to have a
   vote on the floor, I believe that we would be successful in passing
   them.

   STAMBERG: Any idea how much these programs will cost with Republican
   resistance about raising any sort of expenditures, and also such a
   fragile economy?

   PELOSI: Well, there's no federal cost in raising the minimum wage.
   There's no federal government cost in pay equity. These are policy
   issues. The childcare issue probably has to be done in steps. But when
   children are learning, parents can be learning. And when the children
   are in preschool, that frees parents to earn without carrying the
   burden of childcare.

   STAMBERG: What about the issue of party solidarity? There are members
   of your own party divided about how far Democrats ought to go after
   liberal economic policies, and at what cost...

   PELOSI: We develop our policy working in consensus. So it's not as if
   somebody hands something down and says this is what it is. We have been
   united and we respect the diversity in our caucus in every way,
   including philosophical. But I will say this. With the last election we
   elected 51 new members to the House of Representatives. The first time
   in the history of the world I think this has happened; making our
   caucus a majority of women, minorities and LGBT community people.

   And what we want to do is reduce the deficit, and nothing does that
   more than investing in education. So anybody who says, well, we've got
   to cut education because we have to reduce the deficit, doesn't know
   what they're talking about. So we will have a united position 'cause we
   will build consensus within our party, for what that is.

   STAMBERG: House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, joining us from North
   Branford, Connecticut where she's promoting her new women's economic
   agenda. Thank you.

   PELOSI: Thank you so much. It's lovely to be with you.
