at Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology lecture

   Tuck Tucker Tuck Tucker, supervising storyboard director of the
   Nickelodeon animated series "SpongeBob Squarepants," will present "The
   Art of Drawing Story" on Wednesday, Feb. 20 at 5 p.m. in Hancock
   Auditorium.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., Feb. 11, 2013 - Have you ever wondered how an animated
   series evolves from an idea to a complete episode on your television
   screen? Tuck Tucker, supervising storyboard director of the Nickelodeon
   animated series, "SpongeBob Squarepants," will demystify the process
   during his talk, "The Art of Drawing Story," on Wednesday, Feb. 20 at 5
   p.m. in Hancock Auditorium on the Virginia Tech campus.

   Tucker's talk, which is part of the [160]Institute for Creativity,
   Arts, and Technology's ArtsFusion seminar series, is free and open to
   the public. The event is co-presented with Virginia Tech's School of
   Visual Arts in the [161]College of Architecture and Urban Studies.

   Tucker will share insight gained during his 28-year career in film and
   television, detailing how he made the transition from growing up in
   Lynchburg, Va. to becoming a working professional in Los Angeles. His
   talk will uncover the process of how an episode of an animated series
   is created -- from outlines, premises, and storyboards, to dialogue,
   animation, and sound effects.

   During his visit, Tucker will also work with students in a 3-D
   animation class taught by Thomas Tucker, associate professor of
   creative technology in the School of Visual Arts. Some of the visual
   arts students who worked with Tuck Tucker at his workshop earlier in
   the day will join him for his public presentation, presenting their own
   ideas for the ending of a "SpongeBob Squarepants" episode.

   Tucker has worked on some well-known projects during his career,
   including Walt Disney Productions' "The Little Mermaid," "The Simpsons"
   for Fox Broadcasting Company, and several Nickelodeon series, such as
   "Rugrats," "The Ren and Stimpy Show," and "Hey Arnold!"

   In 2007, he became a writer for the "SpongeBob Squarepants" series,
   transitioning to supervising storyboard director in 2010. He won an
   Annie Award, the highest honor given for excellence in animation, for
   his work on the show in 2011.

   "It was here that I found myself happiest," Tucker explains about his
   work on "SpongeBob Squarepants." "I work with top writing and drawing
   professionals who really know their craft.  The artists are not bound
   by scripts and are encouraged to think on their feet, which is the best
   possible environment for creating funny cartoons."

   The show recently went into hiatus, which has allowed Tucker the
   opportunity to direct another Nickelodeon production, "Fairly
   Oddparents."

   Tucker was born and raised in Lynchburg, Va., where his teachers at
   Virginia Episcopal School took a personal interest in his work and
   encouraged his creativity. He attended Virginia Commonwealth
   University, spending his final years there as a student moonlighting at
   Candy Apple, the only animation studio in the state at the time, and
   working full-time for HBO Films as a production assistant for Robert
   Preston, Sam Waterston, and Mary Tyler Moore. His colleagues at HBO
   encouraged him to bring his animation talents to Los Angeles, where he
   relocated after completing the communication arts program at Virginia
   Commonwealth University in 1984.

   research and art, educational innovation, and scientific and commercial
   discovery, the institute works to foster the creative process to create
   new possibilities for exploration and expression through learning,
   discovery, and engagement. This includes preparing students in
   kindergarten through 12th grade and higher education environments to
   succeed in a world that demands teamwork and collaboration of science,
   technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines; promoting new
   research domains that transcend institutionalized boundaries; and
   participating with people of all ages in the process of co-creation.
