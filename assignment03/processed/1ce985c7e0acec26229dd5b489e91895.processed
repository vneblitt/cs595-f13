   Eight Million Stories: Hip-Hop In 1993.
   Ronald Croudy

   Over the 12 months of 1993, the [49]Wu-Tang Clan, Snoop Dogg, A Tribe
   Called Quest, Queen Latifah, [50]Tupac Shakur and more than a dozen
   other rap groups all released albums that helped change the sound of
   America.

   Twenty years later, NPR Music's Microphone Check will tape an evening
   of stories about this singularly productive and creative year in
   hip-hop culture. On Wednesday, Sept. 25, in New York, we'll gather
   together key figures and witnesses of rap music in 1993 to reminisce,
   reveal and laugh. For information on how to get a free ticket follow
   [51]@NPRHipHop. We'll announce details this week.

   Our panel will include [52]Mike Dean, producer and engineer for
   Rap-A-Lot Records and frequent Kanye West collaborator; Wu-Tang Clan
   member [53]Ghostface Killah; [54]Ralph [55]McDaniels, video director
   and host of the influential cable access show Video Music Box; Faith
   Newman, former A&R at Columbia Records, who signed [56]Nas; and Prince
   Paul, producer and DJ who worked with [57]De La Soul. In addition to
   firsthand insights and anecdotes from these luminaries, attendees will
   be treated to a slideshow of (sometimes embarrassing) throwback photos.
   We'll end the night with all-1993 DJ sets from [58]DJ Cuzzin B and Ali
   Shaheed Muhammad, co-host of NPR Music's Microphone Check and member of
   [59]A Tribe Called Quest (which released landmark album Midnight
   Marauders in '93).

   The "Eight Million Stories: Hip-Hop in 1993" taping is part of the
   yearlong NPR Music series [60]Hip-Hop's Golden Year. An edited version
   of the conversation will be made available here as an episode of
   Microphone Check.
