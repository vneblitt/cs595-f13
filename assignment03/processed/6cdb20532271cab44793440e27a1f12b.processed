Who may perform abortions?

In California, a bill would allow trained non-physicians to perform some
abortions. It's a necessary measure to ensure women have access to safe

       [155]Abortion, a losing issue for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker

   By The Times editorial board

   September 3, 2013

   Under California law, abortions may only be performed by medical
   doctors. But a new bill, which just won approval in the Legislature,
   would allow certified nurse midwives, nurse practitioners and physician
   assistants who complete special training to perform certain routine
   first trimester abortions.

   The bill, AB 154, by Assembly Majority Leader [156]Toni Atkins (D-San
   Diego), is a reasonable and sensible measure that Gov. [157]Jerry Brown
   should sign.

   California has taken steps over the years to make sure that
   [158]abortion is not just legal but available. Still, according to a
   statement in support of the bill from the California [159]Women's
   Health Alliance, "over half of our counties do not have an accessible
   abortion provider." In rural areas, that means women have to travel
   hours, often by train or bus, to get to a doctor who can perform the
   procedure. In underserved urban areas, women face delays in getting
   medical appointments at clinics. When a woman can't get an abortion in
   the first trimester, she may end up getting one in the later stages of
   pregnancy, which can mean a more complicated and more expensive
   abortion.

   In the last few years there has been a troubling increase in the number
   of states passing restrictive laws that attempt to curtail abortion by
   limiting the window of time in which women may have one or setting
   unnecessary and onerous preconditions -- such as waiting periods and
   mandatory counseling. Some of these laws have been challenged in court
   and rightly struck down.

   The fact is that since the Supreme Court's decision in Roe vs. Wade 40
   years ago, the United States has recognized a woman's right to have an
   abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb (about 24 weeks).
   Given that, it is incumbent on government to help ensure that abortion
   is a safe and accessible medical procedure.

   AB 154 will not lower the standard of care for women, as some opponents
   have argued. If anything, it will raise the standard of care by
   increasing the number of trained practitioners who can perform
   abortions by medication or routine aspiration techniques in California,
   and by offering more opportunities for women seeking the procedure to
   be seen and treated earlier in their pregnancies. A multiyear pilot
   study conducted by researchers at the Bixby Center for Global
   Reproductive Health at UC San Francisco compared complication rates for
   abortions performed by doctors and by other healthcare providers
   trained to carry out the procedure. The rates for both groups were
   under 2%, and the majority of complications were minor.

   AB 154 seeks to broaden access to women who want an abortion but have
   difficulty getting to a doctor. It is a sound solution to the problem.

   thanx,  but too many demands.   money is always frst, the silly idea by
   in n out burger that $10.50 is a great starting wage is the prob.   as
   a fam owned industry their MILLIONS will be CLEVERLY passed down to
   useless heirs/ foundations and the SLAVE WRKS are haAppy w $ 5.00/hr or
   atr taxes = 1,000/mo w ov time

   my wife  cheated w another to have a second boy.   we both to yng and
   irresponsible at 17 .  .  .  .   but, in 1963 $ 399/mo excellent pay =
   $ 6,400.00 w inflation (  3,000 aftr taxes).   my wife was able to
   remain at home w the babies.

   an ABORTION or inconvenient child is as LOVED as much as any othr.   my
   second wife nvr forgave herself.

   my dearest frst love was snt to Maine to have her preg n the chid
   adopted.

   as the person below suggests, TIME TO STOP TREATING WOMB-EN AS WOMBS.

   The people commenting here show such total regard for their daughters,
   wives, mothers, neighbours, and other women who have made the decision
   to terminate a pregnancy. This may have been becasue of their personal
   health, becasue they realized that they were not in a position to give
   birth for some reason, or were raped by a family member.

   If you were serious about reducing the number of abortions, you would
   be campaigning for sex education, free access to contraception and the
   morning after pill, increased education and workplace equality for
   women, education for men to be non-violent, and reducing poverty. All
   of thes ethings have been demonstrated to reduce the number of
   abortions. Making abortions difficult to obtain, does not.

   The LA Times very moral editorial Board states that there "has been a
   troubling increase in the number of states passing restrictive laws
   that attempt to curtail abortion by limiting the window of time in
   which women may have one or setting unnecessary and onerous
   preconditions -- such as waiting periods and mandatory counseling."

   I imagine that the LA Times would prefer teenagers to NOT have any form
   of counseling before they have a surgical proceedure that can now be
   perfomed by a non-surgeon.  And of course the parents don't need to
   know thier daughter is going under the knife - the minor has to give
   consent for this. Amazingly bad laws all in the name of preventing an
   unwanted human being from ever being born.

   The health care provider is not permitted to inform a parent or legal
   guardian without minor's consent. The provider can only share the
   minor's medical records with the signed consent of the minor. (Cal.
   Health & Safety Code §§ 123110(a), 123115(a); Cal. Civ. 56.10, 56.11).
