   Lincoln prepared this scrapbook of newspaper clippings of his debates
   with Stephen A. Douglas shortly after the close of the 1858 Senate
   campaign. The scrapbook begins with a clipping of Lincoln‚s famous
   ‚House Divided‚ speech, which he gave at the close of the Republican
   state convention when he had been nominated to run for the U.S. Senate.
   He deliberately selected debate texts taken from politically friendly
   newspapers. The clippings of his own speeches were from the Republican
   Chicago Press & Tribune, and Douglas‚s from the Democratic Chicago
   Times. Lincoln occasionally made notes in the margins when he felt the
   reporting required changes or comment.
