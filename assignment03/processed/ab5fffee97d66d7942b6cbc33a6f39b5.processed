71-year-old Betsey Johnson -- SORRY, GOTTA SPLIT

   9/12/2013 3:30 PM PDT [29]BY TMZ STAFF
   71 Y.O. Betsey Johnson
   SORRY
   GOTTA SPLIT
   0912_betsy_johnson_splits_getty
   She's 71 years old ... but that didn't stop legendary designer Betsey
   Johnson from doing a FULL SPLIT on stage Wednesday at Fashion Week ...
   while wearing a hilarious pair of pink briefs.
   Who knows, maybe she's got an extremely high threshold for pain ... she
   is holding what appears to be a prescription pill bottle after all.
   Either way. Respect.

   Is she asking someone to help her open that bottle? Looks like she
   needed to take one more of those pills.

   [68]Truth Be Told

   FYI: Just so everyone knows - There is someone who is cloning me (and a
   lot of other people) and is posting on all the boards. If you don't
   believe me - click on his avatar and then mine you will see for
   yourself. This person steals other people's avatar's and nick names
   then hides behind a proxy server and posts on all the boards. Beware:
   This person may very easily clone you also! So Heads Up!!

   Is she going to continue with this ridiculous look into her 80s? Cut
   that wig and stop the surgeries. Grow old gracefully and with a shred
   of dignity left.

   She is poorer than poor. Stays in bankruptcy because she keeps
   stretching her face. This angle doesn't show the gruesome side. If you
   see her straight forward, trust me, you will take off running.
