   BLACKSBURG, Va., Feb. 1, 2013 - Virginia Tech Senior Vice President and
   Provost Mark McNamee and College of Science Dean Lay Nam Chang, cut the
   ribbon Jan. 22 on what college officials consider to be one of the
   first cell culture labs in the United States specifically for
   undergraduate use.

   The $900,000 project is part of the college's Integrated Science
   Curriculum. The program began in 2011 with 11 students who work in
   teams across various science disciplines. "This curriculum is a model
   for high-value teaching," McNamee said. "This is an innovative,
   forward-looking program that points to where science is going as a
   whole," he said.

   The new cell culture lab and two teaching labs are an essential step
   forward in the two-year-old curriculum. "These labs represent an
   initiative to teach science in its totality; by not separating it into
   specialties, but by concentrating in topics and issues to get a sense
   of what science is all about," said Chang.

   In 2011, the college took 11 students into the program and another 24
   in 2012. The program is on pace to bring in nearly 50 in the fall of
   2013. Students who take part in the program spend two years working in
   teams across a range of scientific fields including physics, biology,
   mathematics, and chemistry. These integrated programs help students
   understand fundamental principles in emerging technologies.

   The [160]College of Science at Virginia Tech gives students a
   comprehensive foundation in the scientific method. Outstanding faculty
   members teach courses and conduct research in biological sciences,
   chemistry, economics, geosciences, mathematics, physics, psychology,
   and statistics. The college offers programs in cutting-edge areas
   including, among others, those in energy and the environment,
   developmental science across the lifespan, infectious diseases,
   computational science, nanoscience, and neuroscience. The College of
   Science is dedicated to fostering a research-intensive environment that
   promotes scientific inquiry and outreach.
