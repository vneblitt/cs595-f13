[16]Key findings:

     * Top executives from the 25 biggest pre-crisis subprime lenders --
       including at least 14 founders or CEOs -- are back in the mortgage
       business at mortgage companies that are less regulated than banks.
     * Many of these lenders make loans that don't meet the strict
       standards required to earn a government guarantee -- loans banks
       have largely abandoned.
     * Mortgage lending remains far safer than before the crisis with many
       of the worst loan products banned outright. But lenders are
       beginning to loosen their standards, and experts say the industry
       will find ways over the coming years to offer ever-riskier
       products.

[17]After the Meltdown

   In the fall of 2008, the U.S. economy nearly collapsed thanks to an
   unprecedented wave of mortgage foreclosures. In "After the Meltdown --
   Where are they now?" the Center for Public Integrity revisits the
   subprime lenders, Wall Street banks and government regulators that were
   most responsible for the crash -- and finds few if any have been held
   accountable.

[30]Subprime executives, back in the mortgage business

By [31]John Dunbar, [32]Daniel Wagner and [33]Chris Zubak-Skees

September 3, 2013

   In 2009, the Center for Public Integrity published [34]a list of the
   top 25 subprime lenders from 2005 through 2007 -- the peak of the real
   estate boom -- whose bad loans led to the near collapse of the economy.
   We found senior executives from all 25 lenders are back in the mortgage
   business, including a dozen former CEOs and founders of subprime
   lenders.
    1. Countrywide Home Loans
       Stanford L. Kurland
       Stanford L. Kurland was the No. 2 executive at the nation's top
       subprime lender, working at Countrywide from 1979 to 2006 . Today
       he is founder, chairman and CEO of [35]PennyMac, an investment firm
       and real estate investment trust that he founded with other
       Countrywide alumni. Like Countrywide and other pre-crisis mortgage
       giants, PennyMac is set up to profit at every stage of the
       home-finance chain: Lending, bundling mortgages into bonds,
       reselling and investing in the bonds and collecting payments.
       [36]See full lender profile
    2. Ameriquest Mortgage Co./ACC Capital Holdings Corp.
       Paul Lyons
       [37]Paul Lyons was director of whole loan sales for Ameriquest and
       its owner, ACC Capital Holdings. In 2006, Ameriquest was one of the
       first in the subprime industry to show signs of collapse. Today, he
       is COO of CS Financial, which advertises loans with down payments
       as low as 3.5 percent and does not always require borrowers' tax
       returns or income documentation. [38]See full lender profile
    3. New Century Financial Corp.
       Carl W. Vernon
       [39]Carl W. Vernon was president of the retail division for New
       Century and is now chief operating officer of Nations Direct
       Mortgage LLC in Irvine, Calif., the "official sponsor of
       prosperity" according to the company's marketing materials. [40]See
       full lender profile
    4. First Franklin Corp./National City Corp./Merrill Lynch & Co.
       L. Andrew Pollock
       [41]L. Andrew Pollock was president and CEO of First Franklin and
       is now co-CEO of Rushmore Loan Management Services, which collects
       payments and is ramping up its lending operations. He told Congress
       in 2007 that First Franklin's underwriting standards "assure the
       quality" of its loans. They defaulted at rates that were high even
       for the subprime industry. [42]See full lender profile
    5. Long Beach Mortgage Co./Washington Mutual
       David Schneider
       Until February, [43]David Schneider was co-CEO of Caliber Home
       Loans, owned by Lone Star Funds. During the boom, he was president
       of home loans at Washington Mutual Inc., the biggest failed bank,
       and ran its subprime lending subsidiary Long Beach Mortgage.
       In 2011, Schneider agreed to pay $50,000 to settle civil fraud
       charges that he negligently caused Washington Mutual to take
       "extreme and historically unprecedented risks" that caused billions
       in losses and the nation's biggest bank failure.
       The payment is unlikely to dent his net worth. Schneider was paid
       more than $5.9 million for his three years running Washington
       Mutual's home loans division ; received $3.7 million for the
       stately, Seattle-area home that he sold the year before his
       settlement; and is trying to claim $390,000 from a retirement
       account currently tied up in Washington Mutual's bankruptcy. He
       owns a mountain home worth $1.2 million in Park City, Utah, through
       a family trust.
       In fact, the civil penalty is only $5,000 more than Schneider's
       profit from flipping the Dallas house he purchased when he joined
       Caliber's predecessor company in 2012. This May, after leaving
       Caliber, Schneider sold the home to David Slear, the ninth
       executive on this list, for $768,000. Slear had run HSBC's
       foreclosure division. Schneider hired Slear to do the same work for
       Caliber. The house was appraised at far more: $957,230. [44]See

    6. Option One Mortgage Corp./H&R Block Inc.
       Brad Dubrish
       [45]Brad Dubrish was CEO and founder of Option One, the subprime
       lending arm of tax preparation company H&R Block Inc. Dubrish, a
       former college football player, now heads up wholesale lending for
       New Penn Financial, a fast-growing lender whose loans aim "to fill
       critical service gaps in the market, offering products for
       investors, foreign nationals, those with minor credit blemishes."

    7. Fremont Investment & Loan/Fremont General Corp.
       Dave Gordon
       [47]Dave Gordon was senior vice president for loan servicing at
       Fremont and has moved on to Carrington Holding Co. where he is
       chief operating officer. Carrington's subsidiaries lend to people
       with FICO scores as low as 580 and offer a range of other real
       estate and investment related services. [48]See full lender profile
    8. Wells Fargo Financial/Wells Fargo & Co.
       John Robbins
       [49]John Robbins founded three mortgage companies -- two before the
       crisis and one more recently. Until 2007, he was chairman and CEO
       of American Mortgage Network, which was sold to Wachovia Bank.
       Wachovia nearly collapsed under the weight of bad loans made by
       AmNet and others and was rescued by Wells Fargo. Robbins founded
       his third company, Bexil American Mortgage, in 2011 and recently
       stepped down as president and CEO. [50]See full lender profile
    9. HSBC Finance Corp./HSBC Holdings plc
       David Slear
       [51]David Slear was director and senior vice president for default
       services with HSBC and is now senior vice president for default
       servicing with Caliber Home Loans Inc. [52]See full lender profile
   10. WMC Mortgage Corp./General Electric Co.
       Amy Brandt
       [53]Amy Brandt was president and CEO of WMC and one of the youngest
       subprime executives on the list. After the crisis, she started a
       record label. Today, she is chief operating officer of Prospect
       Mortgage LLC, which is run by a former executive of IndyMac and
       American Home Mortgage and chaired by a former CEO of Fannie Mae.

       James Harrington

       overseeing the company's lender relationships, including with BNC,
       a subprime lender that Lehman bought . Today is he is managing
       director for investor relations with Resurgent Mortgage Servicing,
       which specializes in servicing HLTF (high loan to value) loans, as
       well as "scratch & dent performing and non-performing loans."

   12. Chase Home Finance/JPMorgan Chase & Co.
       Ramesh Lakshminarayanan
       [57]Ramesh Lakshminarayanan was chief risk officer of with Chase

       banking at Chase. He is now executive vice president and chief risk
       officer of Nationstar Mortgage, located near Dallas. [58]See full
       lender profile
   13. Accredited Home Lenders Inc./Lone Star Funds V
       Jim Konrath
       [59]Jim Konrath was chairman and CEO of Accredited and is now
       chairman of LendSure Financial Services, a "fresh face" to the
       mortgage industry but with experience that is "decades deep," the
       company says. [60]See full lender profile
   14. IndyMac Bancorp, Inc.
       Scott Van Dellen
       [61]Scott Van Dellen was CEO of the homebuilder division of IndyMac
       , the costliest bank failure of the financial crisis. In December,
       a jury upheld charges that he two others had negligently approved
       risky loans after they knew the bubble had burst. (Insurers are
       likely to cover much of the $169 million fine, which is still
       subject to appeal.) Today, Van Dellen is president of Yale Street
       Mortgage, which lends to real estate investors who want to "buy,
       fix and flip" homes and apartment buildings. [62]See full lender

       Jeffrey Tennyson
       [65]Jeffrey Tennyson was chairman and CEO of Equifirst and is now
       head of B2R, which stands for "buy to rent," Bloomberg reported
       this summer. The company is owned by Blackstone Group LP, the
       nation's largest private equity firm, which has bought 30,000
       distressed homes to put on the currently lucrative rental market. A
       Blackstone spokesman declined to comment on or dispute the news
       report. [66]See full lender profile

       Anthony Villani
       [67]Anthony Villani made a lateral move: He went from executive
       vice president and general counsel of EMC Mortgage, which was owned
       by Bear Stearns and fed its mortgage securities pipeline; to
       executive vice president and general counsel with Nationstar
       Mortgage, among the fastest growing mortgage servicers. Nationstar

       (AIG)
       Jerry Schiano
       [69]Jerry Schiano was CEO of Wilmington Finance, a subprime lender
       that he sold to the bailed-out insurance giant American
       International Group. Wilmington later settled charges of
       discriminatory lending that allegedly occurred while he was in
       charge.
       Schiano is CEO of New Penn Financial, which he formed with former
       Wilmington colleagues. New Penn was acquired in 2011 by Shellpoint,
       a mortgage bundler owned in part by Lewis Ranieri, who helped

   Editor's note: Nearly five years ago, on Sept. 15, Lehman Brothers
   Holdings Inc. filed for Chapter 11, the largest bankruptcy in the
   nation's history. The move set off a series of dramatic actions in
   Washington, D.C., and on Wall Street as bankers and regulators sought
   to avoid a shutdown of the global economy. To mark the anniversary, the
   Center for Public Integrity is publishing [86]a three-part series on
   what has happened since the meltdown.

   Andy Pollock rode the last subprime mortgage wave to the top then got
   out as the industry collapsed and took the U.S. economy with it. Today,
   he's back in business.

   Pollock was president and CEO of First Franklin, a subprime lender
   whose risky loans to vulnerable consumers hastened the downfall of
   Merrill Lynch after the Wall Street investment bank bought it in 2006
   for $1.3 billion. He was still running First Franklin for Merrill in
   2007 when he told Congress that the company had "a proven history as a
   responsible lender" employing "underwriting standards that assure the
   quality of the loans we originate."

   The next year, federal banking regulators said First Franklin was among
   the lenders with the highest foreclosure rates on subprime loans in
   hard-hit cities. Standard & Poor's ranked some of its loans from 2006
   and 2007 among the worst in the country. Lawsuits filed by AIG and
   others who bought the loans quoted former First Franklin underwriters
   saying that the company was "fudging the numbers" and calling its loan
   review practices "basically criminal," with bonuses for people who
   closed loans that violated its already-loose lending standards.

   Merrill closed First Franklin in 2008 after the subprime market
   imploded and demand for risky loans dried up. For Pollock and his
   contemporaries, who have survived decades of boom and bust in the
   mortgage trade, the recent near-toppling of the global economy was a
   cyclical, temporary downturn in a business that finally is beginning to
   rebound.

   Five years after the financial crisis crested with the bankruptcy of
   Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., top executives from the biggest subprime
   lenders are back in the game. Many are developing new loans that target
   borrowers with low credit scores and small down payments, pushing the
   limits of tighter lending standards that have prevailed since the
   crisis.

   Some experts fear they won't know where to stop.

   The Center for Public Integrity in 2009 identified the [87]top 25
   lenders by subprime loan production from 2005 through 2007. Today,
   senior executives from all 25 of those companies or companies that they
   swallowed up before the crash are back in the mortgage business. Most
   of these newer "non-bank" lenders are making or collecting on loans
   that may be too risky to qualify for backing by the U.S. government. As
   the industry regains its footing, these specialty lenders represent a
   small but growing portion of the market.

   The role of big subprime lenders in teeing up the financial crisis is
   well documented.

   Lawsuits by federal regulators and shareholders have surfaced tales of
   predatory lending, abusive collection practices and document fraud. A
   commission charged by Congress to look at the roots of the crisis said
   lenders "made loans that they knew borrowers could not afford and that
   could cause massive losses to investors in mortgage securities."

   Risky loans, a Senate investigation concluded, "were the fuel that
   ignited the financial crisis."

   As borrowers defaulted at increasing rates in 2006 and 2007, global
   financial markets tightened, then froze. The result was the worst
   economic crash since the Great Depression. Today, millions of Americans
   still face foreclosure. Yet few subprime executives have faced
   meaningful consequences.

   "Old habits die hard, especially when there's no incentive to do things
   differently," says Rachel Steinmetz, a [88]senior
   underwriter-turned-whistleblower who worked at subprime
   lender [89]GreenPoint Mortgage, later bought by Capital One, until June
   2006. "The same shenanigans are going on again because the same people
   are controlling the industry."

    To be sure, loans offered by their new companies face unprecedented
   scrutiny by regulators and investors. Many of the riskiest practices
   from the subprime era have been outlawed.

   "We could never, ever go back to the kinds of products we were selling.
   They were disastrous," says John Robbins, who founded three mortgage
   lenders -- two before the crisis, and one in 2011, from which he
   recently stepped down. The new Holy Grail for some lenders, according
   to Robbins: a mortgage that complies with new rules yet "creates some
   opportunity to lower the bar a little bit and allow consumers the
   opportunity to buy homes [who] really deserve them."

   Robbins is one of several executives identified in the Center's
   investigation who have gathered up their old teams and gotten back into
   the mortgage business. Others have tapped the same private investors
   who backed out-of-control lending in the previous decade.

   The lenders vary in how willing they are to accept lower down payments,
   weaker credit scores or other factors that can make a loan more risky.

   New Penn Financial allows interest-only payments on some loans and lets
   some borrowers take on payments totaling up to 58 percent of their
   pre-tax income. (The maximum for prime loans is 43 percent.) PennyMac's
   non-government loans make up a tiny portion of its total lending and
   have virtually the same underwriting standards as prime mortgages, but
   are bigger than government agencies would allow. And Rushmore Home
   Loans today so far offers only mortgages that could likely get a
   government guarantee, though a company website says it "intends to
   expand and enhance current product offering."

   The newer loan offerings remain fairly safe, but companies gradually
   are growing more flexible about what documentation they require and how
   big borrowers' payments must be, says Guy Cecala, publisher of the
   trade magazine Inside Mortgage Finance. "You're going to see a little
   more risk coming into the system" Cecala says, as lenders permit
   smaller down payments and finance more investment properties.

   Riding out the storm

   After First Franklin closed in 2008, Pollock remained in his
   five-bedroom, $2.4 million home in ritzy Monte Sereno, Calif. He led a
   consulting firm that became a temporary haven for at least 15 former
   First Franklin employees.

   By 2013, Pollock was co-CEO of Rushmore Loan Management Services,  a
   company that traditionally collected payments on loans and is now
   originating loans. The company offers adjustable rate mortgages and
   down payments as low as 5 percent. A company spokeswoman said
   Rushmore's loans meet government standards and that some government
   programs allow low down payments to encourage homeownership.

   Pollock is among at least 14 founders or CEOs of top subprime lenders
   whose post-crisis employers want to serve consumers who might not be
   able to qualify for bank loans.

   Also on the list is Amy Brandt, who at age 31 became CEO of WMC
   Mortgage Corp., [91]then owned by General Electric. Brandt`s properties
   include a $2 million, 13,600-square-foot mansion in a Dallas suburb
   that Forbes magazine once ranked as America's most affluent, with a
   landscaped pool and waterfall and a wood-paneled home theater.

   In July, she was named chief operating officer of Prospect Mortgage,
   backed by private equity firm Sterling Partners. The firm is run by a
   former executive of IndyMac and American Home Mortgage and chaired by a
   former CEO of the government-sponsored mortgage finance giant Fannie
   Mae. Prospect's mortgage offerings include interest-only loans whose
   payments can increase sharply after a few years.

   Jim Konrath, the founder and former CEO of Accredited Home Lenders,
   which cratered so quickly when the housing bubble burst that a
   private-equity firm that had agreed to buy it tried to back out of the
   deal, is today chairman of LendSure Financial Services, a company that
   advertises "serving customers along the credit continuum, and doing so
   in a way that is both profitable and fair."

   The company's founders "successfully emerged from the latest industry
   downturn -- and navigated others before it," LendSure assures visitors
   to its website.

   In 2011, California state regulators accused Konrath and LendSure of
   collecting illegal upfront fees from people seeking loan modifications
   and failing to maintain required records. Konrath paid $1,500 and was
   required to take a class and pass a professional responsibility exam.
   David Hertzel, a lawyer for the company, said Konrath was not "actively
   involved" in the decision and was penalized because the company was
   operating under his broker's license.

   With LendSure based in San Diego, Konrath has been able to keep his
   secluded, 4,200-square-foot house in nearby Poway, as well as a ski
   chalet near Lake Tahoe.

   And there's Scott Van Dellen, former CEO of the homebuilder-lending
   division owned by IndyMac -- a California bank whose collapse was the
   nation's costliest. Last December, a jury agreed that he and two other
   former executives should pay $169 million to federal regulators,
   finding that they negligently approved risky loans to homebuilders.
   (IndyMac's insurers may pay some or all of the judgment, which is
   subject to a possible appeal.)

   Van Dellen's new company, Yale Street Mortgage, is located in the same
   Pasadena ZIP code as IndyMac and provides loans to real estate
   investors who want to "buy, fix and flip" single-family homes and small
   apartment buildings.

   Lender yes, bank no

   Most of the bad loans that brought about the crash in 2008 were made by
   lenders that were not owned by banks. These companies cannot accept
   deposits -- their loans are funded by investors, including private
   equity firms, hedge funds and investment banks. In the run-up to the
   crash, big Wall Street investment banks binged on subprime lenders,
   spending billions to buy them up and resell their loans just as the
   market turned.

   Lehman Brothers, for example, bought BNC Mortgage in 2004 and financed
   subprime loans offered by other companies. Jim Harrington was a senior
   vice president with Lehman from 1999 through 2008 and is now a managing
   director for Resurgent Capital Services, which collects mortgage and
   other debts and specializes in "challenging loan portfolios."

   At Lehman, Harrington was charged with determining how much risk was
   posed by a lenders' legal compliance and lending decisions. He says he
   was not a "key decision maker or a key source of setting credit policy"
   at Lehman, but more of "a spoke in the wheel."

   As the mortgage industry undergoes another wave of consolidation,
   non-bank lenders are again attractive targets for investors seeking to
   enter the mortgage business overnight. They also remain far less
   regulated than banks that take deposits. Banks tend to offer only the
   safest home loans -- those that qualify automatically for government
   backing.

   New regulations have made lending standards so tight, industry
   officials argue, that many Americans who should qualify for home loans
   are effectively shut out of the market.

   "The American consumer is underserved at this point," says Robbins, the
   three-time mortgage CEO. "How do we serve the low- to moderate-income
   community as an industry when you have these kinds of daunting
   regulations?"

   Many of the most problematic loans from before the crisis have been
   banned, including "liar loans," which didn't require borrowers to prove
   their income; and balloon loans, which offer low payments for a number
   of years then sock borrowers with a giant, one-time payoff at the end.

   Non-bank lenders now face on-site examinations by the Consumer
   Financial Protection Bureau and can be punished for making deceptive
   loans, or loans that borrowers clearly cannot repay. The
   CFPB [92]found recently that many lenders lack basic systems to ensure
   that they comply with the law.

   Still, lenders are finding other ways to offer loans to people who can
   only make a small down payment or who have lower credit scores than
   traditional banks will accept. Such loans, known in the post-meltdown
   era as "non-prime" or "below-prime," go to borrowers who would not meet
   the standards of government-backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and
   Freddie Mac.

   Carrington Holding Co., for example, will lend to borrowers with credit
   scores as low as 580, so long as they can prove adequate income and
   savings. The average credit score for a prime mortgage borrower now
   tops 700. Christopher Whalen, executive vice president and managing
   director at Carrington, says borrowers with banged-up credit histories
   are safe bets if they can show they have the income and savings to
   afford payments.

   So far, non-prime loans by non-bank lenders are only a sliver of the
   market -- 5 percent, by some estimates. But the industry is mushrooming
   in size. The two fastest-growing lenders are not owned by banks.

   To get a sense of the growth, one need only look at the volume of
   non-government-backed loans that are being pooled into mortgage bonds.
   Loans in these pools tend to be too risky to satisfy banks' stringent
   lending requirements.

   Companies are expected to issue more than $20 billion of the
   non-guaranteed bonds this year, up from $6 billion in 2012, according
   to an April [93]report from Standard & Poor's. By comparison, in 2005,
   just as home values began to dip and foreclosures to rise, companies
   bundled $1.19 trillion in mortgage-related investments that were not
   backed by the government.

   In the industry's mid-2000s heyday, bartenders could become loan
   officers and quickly draw six-figure salaries while loose lending
   standards allowed housecleaners and field laborers to buy $300,000
   homes with loans whose teaser rates rocketed upward after a few years,
   forcing them into foreclosure.

   Those days are gone. Marquee-name lenders like Countrywide, IndyMac and
   New Century have closed their doors. While the scenery may be
   different, the cast of characters hasn't changed.

   "Five years down the road and we're back in the thick of it again. It's
   a weird place to be," says Cliff Rossi, who was a high-level risk
   management executive at Countrywide, Washington Mutual and Freddie Mac
   before the crisis.

   Rossi got his start during the savings and loan debacle that felled 747
   lenders in the 1980s and 1990s, he says, and left the industry during
   the 2008 crisis. He currently teaches finance at the University of
   Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.

   "In that intervening 20 years we forgot what we learned in the 80s," he
   says. "I fear right now, human nature being what it is, that downstream
   we could find ourselves in the same situation."

   Most of the 25 executives identified by the Center refused to be
   interviewed for this story.

   At CS Financial, chief marketing officer Neal Mendelsohn referred
   questions about chief operating officer Paul Lyons to Ameriquest, where
   Lyons was director of whole loan sales until 2007, when the company
   stopped lending, according to his LinkedIn profile.

   "There's just the lingering stink of it that's really kind of
   troubling," Mendelsohn says of Lyons' difficulty in shaking his past
   association with Ameriquest. The company's practices were widely
   condemned before the crisis; in 2006, it agreed to pay $325 million to
   settle charges of widespread, fraudulent and misleading lending.

   Van Dellen, the former IndyMac executive who is lending to flippers,
   hung up on a reporter and ignored an emailed interview request.

   From Countrywide to Penny Mac

   Mortgage companies don't just make money by pocketing the interest
   people pay on their home loans. In fact, many resell most of the loans
   they originate to other investors. Much of the lenders' income comes
   from fees charged for everything they do: originating loans, bundling
   them into bonds and collecting payments from borrowers. They don't
   necessarily need the loans to be repaid to make money.

   PennyMac, a fast-growing company founded by former Countrywide Home
   Loans CEO and IndyMac director Stanford Kurland, is a sprawling concern
   that earns fees by originating loans in call centers and online. It
   consists of two intertwined companies: a tax-free investment trust that
   holds mortgage investments and an investment advisor that manages the
   trust and other investment pools, among other activities.

   PennyMac buys loans from pre-approved outside sales offices, bundles
   them and sells off the slices. The company manages other peoples'
   mortgage investments, collects borrowers' payments and forwards them to
   investors. It forecloses on properties and amasses portfolios of loans
   and mortgage-backed securities as investments.

   By the second quarter of this year, it was among the fastest-growing
   lenders, extending $8.9 billion in loans, up from $3.5 billion in last
   year's second quarter, the company says. Ninety-seven percent of the
   loans were purchased from outside lenders.

   Most emerging non-bank lenders are smaller than their pre-crisis
   predecessors and specialize in a handful of these activities. That's
   beginning to change as more of them follow PennyMac's lead, expanding
   their offerings and cobbling together companies that can make money at
   every stage of the mortgage finance process. They accomplish this
   through aggressive acquisitions or by buying the assets of bankrupt
   companies.

   Among PennyMac's first big investments was a joint venture with the
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to buy and service $558 million in
   loans from a failed bank. PennyMac paid roughly 29 cents on the dollar
   for the loans, and says the investment has performed well.

   It's not nearly as big as Kurland's former company, Countrywide, which
   made $490 billion in loans in 2005. But Kurland and his team appear to
   have grand ambitions.

   Countrywide made [94]the most high-cost loans in the years before the
   crash and is among the lenders considered most responsible for fueling
   the mid-2000s housing boom. It was founded in 1968, and by 1992, became
   the biggest home lender in the country.

   "After spending 27 years of my career at Countrywide and assisting in
   growing the company into a large, widely-known enterprise that was
   highly regarded and well respected by regulators, peers, consumers and
   other stakeholders, I faced the most difficult business and personal,
   decision of my career," Kurland said in an emailed statement. "In 2006,
   as a result of irreconcilable differences with the company's prevailing
   management, I was terminated from Countrywide without cause and left
   the company."

   PennyMac spokesmen declined to elaborate on his reasons for leaving.

   After Kurland's departure in late 2006, to boost production,
   Countrywide "eliminated every significant checkpoint on loan quality
   and compensated its employees solely based on the volume of loans
   originated, leading to rampant instances of fraud," according to a
   civil complaint filed last year by the Justice Department against Bank
   of America, which purchased Countrywide in 2008.

   Kurland and other Countrywide alumni formed the tax-free PennyMac
   investment trust in 2009 "specifically to address the opportunities
   created by" the real estate crash, according to public filings. The 14
   members of its senior management team had spent a combined 250 years in
   the mortgage business, the filings say.

   This year, the former Countrywide executives who manage the investment
   trust sold separate stock in their investment advisory and lending
   firm, PennyMac Financial Services, which earns millions of dollars in
   fees for managing the publicly traded, tax-free trust. PennyMac
   Financial Services also manages separate mortgage funds for big-money
   investors.

   The company's name is so similar to those of government-controlled
   mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that regulators forced
   PennyMac to add a disclaimer to its offering documents for potential
   investors, stating that it is not a government enterprise. Regulators
   also questioned PennyMac's assertion that its managers' experience was
   purely a strength, and suggested that "the failures of Countrywide
   while under the management of these individuals" should be considered a
   risk factor.

   PennyMac said in a separate written statement that the complexity of
   the mortgage business demands experienced and expert leaders. They said
   Kurland and his team "have demonstrated sensible leadership over
   decades in the mortgage industry" and noted that the venture is
   supported by major banks, government agencies, regulators and
   investors.

   Kurland, who reportedly sold stock worth nearly $200 million before
   leaving Countrywide in 2006, last year earned about $6.1 million in
   total compensation from the two PennyMac companies. Some of the pay
   isn't available to him until a few years after it is recorded. His
   stake is worth about $150 million, the company says.

   Kurland still owns the $2 million, 9,000-square-foot house he bought in
   1995 with a Countrywide loan. He's also managed to keep a $4.9 million
   beachfront house in Malibu.

   For many Countrywide borrowers, life has been considerably more
   difficult.

   The house was sold in foreclosure after Fore was unable to afford
   monthly payments that nearly doubled, the result of a high-cost
   refinancing loan from Countrywide.

   Fighting foreclosure

   Brenda Fore, a former office supervisor who lives in rural West
   Virginia, has been on government disability benefits since a drunk
   driver struck and injured her in 1998. Her husband, George, has
   suffered from a traumatic brain injury since 2010, also caused by
   a drunk driver, while working at a trucking company.

   The Fores are trying to stay in the home that they've lived in for 33
   years, where they raised two children and several grandchildren. The
   home was sold in foreclosure when their loan payments nearly doubled.

   Fore's house had been paid off for years, but she decided in 2006, when
   rates were low, to take out another mortgage to help her daughter buy a
   mobile home. The trailer sits in Brenda's yard because her daughter
   makes too little money working at a homeless shelter to afford a
   separate lot.

   Fore, 60, refinanced, getting a loan from Countrywide that was based on
   an inflated appraisal, according to a lawsuit she filed in state court.
   The appraiser hired by Countrywide estimated the home's value at
   $92,000, Fore says. An appraiser hired by her lawyer more recently said
   the house is worth about $61,000. Unlike fast-growth markets in the
   Sunbelt, home prices in West Virginia were relatively stable throughout
   the crisis.

   Fore also got a second "piggyback" loan from Countrywide at a much
   higher rate.

   Without the high appraisal value, her lawyer says, Fore could not have
   qualified for the second mortgage. She says she did not have a fair
   opportunity to look over the paperwork and identify any problems
   because Countrywide did not provide her with copies of the closing
   documents until 10 days after the close, according to a lawsuit filed
   in state court in 2011.

   Fore's monthly payment doubled in 2007 because of the Countrywide loan,
   she says, from roughly $400 per month to more than $800. By that time,
   Bank of America had bought Countrywide. Fore asked Bank of America to
   change the loan terms until her husband's workers' compensation
   settlement cleared. The bank told her to keep mailing her payments, but
   repeatedly mailed them back to her -- and deemed her loan to be in
   default.

   One Sunday, she says, she returned to her house to find a pamphlet
   stuck in the fence notifying her that the house would be put up for
   sale.

   "I thought, `Oh, well, what are we going to do now?' " Fore says.
   "There wasn't a whole lot we could do."

   Only after the family home was sold in foreclosure did the bank tell
   her that it had rejected her request for a loan modification.

   Since then, Fore's lawyer has offered to settle with the bank, seeking
   to have the foreclosure sale reversed so that she and George can remain
   in the house.

   A Bank of America spokeswoman said the bank does not comment on open
   litigation. The company is negotiating a possible resolution that would
   keep the Fores in their home, the lawyer says.

   Waiting for the recovery

   The Fores are just one example of the wreckage caused by the subprime
   mania of the last decade. Millions of people across the country lost
   their homes and tens of millions more lost jobs and economic security.

   Meanwhile, many subprime executives left their companies. Some saw
   where the industry was headed and quit. Others were ousted by their
   boards or investors. Many of them didn't go far.

   Bob Dubrish -- a founder and CEO of [95]Option One Mortgage, a top
   subprime lender owned by H&R Block that was shut down in 2007 -- teamed
   up with a firm backed by Lewis Ranieri, who was instrumental in
   developing mortgage bonds, the type of investments that fueled the
   economy's spin off the rails in 2008. In early 2012, Dubrish was put in
   charge of wholesale lending for Ranieri's lender.

   Ranieri, through his company Ranieri Partners, had helped launch the
   mortgage investment firm Shellpoint Partners LLC, known to investors in
   its mortgage bonds as ShellyMac. He then purchased New Penn Financial,
   a Pennsylvania lender. New Penn rose from the ashes of one of American
   International Group's subprime subsidiaries. AIG is the global
   insurance giant that received the biggest single taxpayer bailout of
   any financial company.

   Standard & Poor's, the credit rating company, was not impressed with
   the company's speedy expansion.

   "We view New Penn's aggressive growth targets for all of its production
   channels, coupled with the recent appointment of a head of
   correspondent lending as a potential weakness," the company said in
   a [96]report.  The correspondent lending head, Lisa Schreiber, had run
   the wholesale division of [97]American Home Mortgage, another of the
   top 25 subprime lenders from 2009.

   Dubrish, a former college football player, lives in the same $1.5
   million home in Villa Park, Calif. (town nickname: "The Hidden Jewel"),
   he bought in 2000.

   His boss at New Penn is CEO Jerry Schiano, who founded Wilmington
   Finance before the crisis. Schiano ran Wilmington until 2007, despite
   selling it to AIG subsidiary American General Finance for $121 million
   in 2003. In 2010, Wilmington and another of AIG's companies paid $6.1
   million to settle charges by the Justice Department that it illegally
   overcharged black borrowers during Schiano's tenure, between 2003 and
   2006. The companies denied wrongdoing.

   Getting back on the horse

   Another industry veteran looking to return is Thomas Marano, who led
   the [98]mortgage finance division at Bear Stearns and was on the board
   of its subsidiary, EMC Mortgage. He then took over the mortgage
   subsidiary of GMAC, another top subprime lender. Lawsuits filed by
   federal regulators allege that Marano's unit was so hungry for new
   loans to securitize that they weakened their standards and slipped bad
   loans into pools of mortgages that were resold to investors.

   Asked recently about his plans, Marano said he's toying with the idea
   of launching or buying a non-bank mortgage company.

   "I've been modeling the numbers on ... those opportunities and I'm
   intrigued with that possibility," he told The Wall Street Journal. The
   mortgage business "is a pretty hot space right now so I'm really
   looking at those two options, really doing it on my own or doing it
   with someone who's got more of the infrastructure established."

   There are numerous reasons for Marano and his compatriots to launch
   mortgage companies right now.

   Interest rates, while ticking up a bit lately, are still near all-time
   lows, fueling a boom in refinancing. The government wants to dial back
   its role in housing finance and encourage private investment.

   Separately, a recent Inernal Revenue Service ruling makes it easier for
   some big, consolidated mortgage companies to avoid paying most taxes.
   The IRS decides what investments can be held by Real Estate Investment
   Trusts, companies that buy real estate investments, sell shares to
   investors and enjoy tax advantages. This summer, the IRS said that
   REITs can avoid paying taxes on certain income from collecting mortgage
   payments. Mortgage servicing income is a crucial revenue stream for
   many lenders, particularly as rates rise and the refinancing boom
   slows.

   PennyMac is the most prominent REIT among the new, non-bank lenders but
   many key pre-crisis companies were also set up this way: IndyMac was
   originally formed as a REIT to invest in Countrywide's loans. American
   Home Mortgage was a giant REIT with taxable subsidiaries to carry out
   its lending.

   Those companies succumbed quickly because they were highly leveraged --
   meaning they relied on lots of borrowed money but had relatively little
   cash in reserve. Concerned that the strategy could harm regular
   investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed tightening
   regulation of REITs in 2011, a move that would have limited their
   ability to use leverage. The industry balked, and the commission has so
   far failed to act.

   REITs and other non-bank lenders are regulated more loosely than banks,
   according to Kenneth Kohler, an attorney with Morrison & Foerster, who
   wrote about them in a 2011 [99]client bulletin.

   Regulation in all corners has increased, but "there is no question that
   the burden of the new requirements is substantially higher on banks,"
   Kohler wrote.

   Banks are overseen by at least two regulators -- one responsible for
   their financial strength, the other for their business involving
   consumers. Non-bank mortgage lenders, by contrast, are overseen at the
   federal level mainly by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which
   can only consider potential violations of consumer protection laws.

   In March of 2007, Robbins, then chairman of the Mortgage Bankers
   Association, warned during a congressional hearing that banning risky
   mortgages would kill the dream of homeownership for millions of
   Americans.

   "Assertions that delinquency rates are at crisis levels and a greater
   percentage of borrowers are losing their homes are not supported by the
   data," he said.

   Lenders were "responding to consumer demand for product diversity,
   particularly in high-cost markets," he said, by offering loans whose
   total balance could actually increase over time because borrowers were
   permitted to choose how much they paid.

   Before the crisis, Robbins had founded two companies, which were sold
   for a total of $431 million. Mortgage losses tied to the second
   company, American Mortgage Network, helped sink Wachovia as the
   financial crisis peaked in October 2008. The bank was sold under
   regulators' orders to Wells Fargo. Less than two weeks later, Wells
   received $25 billion of taxpayer bailout money.

   Today, Robbins says he sought to warn his colleagues that lending
   without proper documentation would have "dire consequences." He wanted
   in 2007 to draw a line between irresponsible lending and new kinds of
   loans that properly account for risk, he said in a recent interview.
   After Wachovia bought American Mortgage Network in 2005, Robbins says,
   he "really had no control or say" over what loans it offered.

   "You want new products, you want innovation and you don't want to
   stifle it -- as long as you realize there has to be a solid foundation
   to underwrite the loan," he says.

   Until this summer, Robbins was CEO of Bexil American Mortgage, a
   company he founded in 2011 that employs executives from Robbins' two
   previous subprime ventures. Bexil is offering adjustable rate mortgages
   and allowing down payments as low as 3 percent.

   Robbins remains committed to the mortgage industry.

   "I love this business, helping to provide the American dream to our
   customers and getting paid well to do it," he told Mortgage
   Banking magazine last year. He said he wanted back in at the bottom of
   the market -- what he called "the fun and exciting time in our
   business."

   Bexil, which he launched with a private investor in 2011, was a chance
   to start fresh. It lacks the massive legal liabilities that continue to
   mire what's left of the old subprime lenders.

   The `toxic business model'

   [100]Dan Alpert, managing partner with the investment bank Westwood
   Capital LLC, says there is a reason why the same players keep getting
   back in the game: There was no meaningful effort by the government to
   identify bad actors and hold them accountable.

   "Had there been prosecutions," Alpert says, companies wouldn't touch
   anyone deemed responsible "with a 10-foot pole. The only thing people
   are concerned about is the loss of their freedom. They can lose all
   their money and make more money, but they take it quite seriously when
   jail is staring at them," he says.

   [101]Whalen of Carrington Holding Co., says many of these arguments are
   misguided. Carrington began a decade ago as a small hedge fund and now
   has 3,000 employees who manage investments, lend and service home loans
   and manage and sell real estate. He warns against painting mortgage
   industry professionals too broadly.

   "Are they really in a legal sense bad people, or did they just mess up?
   Were they just trying to do deals?" he asks. He cautions against
   focusing too much blame on individuals like Carrington chief operating
   officer Dave Gordon, who ran capital markets and servicing for Fremont
   Investment & Loan until 2007.

   Blaming only mortgage lenders ignores the roles of overeager or
   disingenuous borrowers, Wall Street traders with voracious appetites
   for mortgage investments and even the Federal Reserve, whose easy money
   policies in the early 2000s encouraged lending and sent global
   investors on a quest for higher-yielding investments, Whalen says.

   "I'm not absolving everybody from responsibility for doing stupid
   things, but you can't paint everyone in this industry as though they
   were just doing this on their own," he says, because mortgage lenders
   "don't operate in a vacuum." He says the U.S. economy slowed sharply
   after the terrorist attacks in 2001 and policymakers decided to help
   inflate the economy by boosting the housing sector.

   He says new rules and fearful investors make it difficult to imagine
   offering irresponsible loans.

   "That old kind of subprime lending is gone," Whalen says. "We have
   prime and slightly-less-than prime. That's it."

   "That won't last," says [102]Susan Wachter, a real estate finance
   professor at the Wharton School.

   The companies rely mainly on fees from originating and servicing loans,
   an income stream that grows only if lending increases, Wachter says. To
   boost lending, she says, companies eventually will have to "undercut
   competitors by getting people into those loans on whatever terms
   possible."

   "That toxic business model is still out there," she says, and it's
   being exploited by the same people who "were feeding toxic mortgages
   into the system" during what she calls "the 2007 frenzy."

   The conclusion seems obvious to Brenda Fore, who is fighting to take
   back the house where she spent her adult life.

   "If it's being built by the fellows who screwed it up last time, you're
   going to have the same result," she says. "The system was dysfunctional
   before, so its offspring are going to be dysfunctional as well."
