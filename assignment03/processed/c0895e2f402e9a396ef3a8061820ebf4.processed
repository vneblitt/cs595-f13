Tax Tips for Newlyweds

   From the IRS

   Late spring and early summer are popular times for weddings. Whatever
   the season, a change in your marital status can affect your taxes. Here
   are several tips from the IRS for newlyweds.
     * It's important that the names and Social Security numbers that you
       put on your tax return match your Social Security Administration
       records. If you've changed your name, report the change to the SSA.
       To do that, file Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card.
       You can get this form on their [56]website at SSA.gov, by calling
       [57]800-772-1213 or by visiting your local SSA office.
     * If your address has changed, file [58]Form 8822, Change of Address
       to notify the IRS. You should also notify the U.S. Postal Service
       if your address has changed. You can ask to have your mail
       forwarded online at [59]USPS.com or report the change at your local
       post office.
     * If you work, report your name or address change to your employer.
       This will help to ensure that you receive your Form W-2, Wage and
       Tax Statement, after the end of the year.
     * If you and your spouse both work, you should check the amount of
       federal income tax withheld from your pay. Your combined incomes
       may move you into a higher tax bracket. Use the [60]IRS Withholding
       Calculator tool to help you complete a new Form W-4, Employee's
       Withholding Allowance Certificate. See [61]Publication 505, Tax
       Withholding and Estimated Tax, for more information.
     * If you didn't qualify to itemize deductions before you were
       married, that may have changed. You and your spouse may save money
       by itemizing rather than taking the standard deduction on your tax
       return. You'll need to use [62]Form 1040 with Schedule A, Itemized
       Deductions. You can't use Form 1040A or 1040EZ when you itemize.
     * If you are married as of December 31, that's your marital status
       for the entire year for tax purposes. You and your spouse usually
       may choose to file your federal income tax return either jointly or
       separately in any given year. You may want to figure the tax both
       ways to determine which filing status results in the lowest tax. In
       most cases, it's beneficial to file jointly.

   For more information about these topics, visit [63]IRS.gov. You can
   also get IRS forms and publications at IRS.gov or by calling
   800-TAX-FORM [64](800-829-3676)
