       Story | Sep 29, 2013
       [138]Chicago's charged battle over electric vehicle stations
       In November 2011, Tim Mason, the president of 350Green, was on the
       phone telling Brian Howe that 350Green would be sold. If the deal
       went through, Mason said contractors such as Howe, who had been
       working with the company on Chicago's electric car charging
       network, would collect only 10 cents on the dollar of what they
       were owed.

     * [170]Airlines reject call for secondary cockpit security gate

       Story | Sep 24, 2013 | 4:04 PM
       [172]Airlines reject call for secondary cockpit security gate
       Are flight decks in commercial airplanes vulnerable to hijackers
       for the few seconds when a pilot opens the cockpit door during
       flight to stretch, get a meal or use the lavatory? That's the
       question behind an effort to require airlines to install secondary
       cockpit barriers, a lightweight gate of steel cables that would be
       drawn in front of the cockpit door. The gates would create a secure
       vestibule area while the pilot locks the main cockpit door behind
       him, foiling potential terrorists with designs...

       [174]Communities pause to remember Sept. 11 victims
       A crowd watched in silence as Palatine firefighters marched
       together to a Sept. 11 memorial ceremony today, held 12 years after
       the tragic events. The event was one of many in the suburbs and
       nation scheduled to remember the thousands of Americans who lost
       their lives in the terrorist attacks. "We do pause in hope, because
       we know that death was not the answer that day, nor is death ever
       the answer," said Palatine Fire Department Chaplain Michael Morris
       at the event. At the Des Plaines Sept. 11...

       Story | Sep 11, 2013
       [176]Editorial: The 9/11 attacks grow distant Twelve years ago
       today, hijackers carried out the worst terrorist attack in American
       history. But 12 years is a long time for a busy, future-oriented
       society like ours, and the 9/11 anniversary is slowly taking on the
       faded aura of the historical past. Memorial ceremonies will be held
       today in New York, Washington and Shanksville, Pa., but they
       probably will be comparatively small affairs. Last year, after the
       big 10th anniversary in 2011, many ceremonies were scaled down and
       fewer people attended them....

     * [187]Obama's leadership fumble
       Story | Sep 11, 2013
       It is hard to comprehend the reaction -- or failure to react --
       Barack Obama would have shown the world if he were president on
       9/11. On the anniversary of that day, Americans must remember what
       makes us leaders in the world. Let's pray that we can regain the
       leadership position that seems to be lost in the sea of Syrian
       indecisiveness. -- Daniel J. Nasharr, Sandwich, Ill.

       attacks, communities throughout Chicagoland will stage ceremonies
