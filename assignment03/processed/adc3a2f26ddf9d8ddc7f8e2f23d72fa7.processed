Happy 150th Birthday to Russian Empire Photographer Sergei M.
Prokudin-Gorskii!

   August 30, 2013 by [14]Barbara Orbach Natanson

   The following is a guest post by Helena Zinkham, Chief, Prints &
   Photographs Division.

   August 30, 2013 marks the 150th birthday for the master of early color
   photography in Russia-Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944).
   [15]Photographer Prokudin-Gorskii on the Karolitskhali River, Georgia.
   1905-1915.

   The [16]Prokudin-Gorskii Collection at the Library of Congress features
   color photographic surveys of the vast Russian Empire made primarily
   between 1909 and 1915. Frequent subjects among the 2,600 distinct
   images include people, religious architecture, historic sites, industry
   and agriculture, public works construction, scenes along water and
   railway transportation routes, and views of villages and cities.

   Using emerging technological advances in color photography,
   Prokudin-Gorskii made numerous photographic trips traveling many
   thousands of miles to systematically document the Russian Empire, which
   controlled one-sixth of the earthâs land mass at that time. It was the
   largest empire in history and spanned what today are eleven different
   times zones.

   The Prints & Photographs Division is honored to preserve this
   remarkable collection, which we acquired in 1948. Reviving the color
   content in 2000 to 2004, through the ingenious efforts of Lynn Brooks,
   Walter Frankhauser, and Blaise AgÃ¼era y Arcas, has also made
   Prokudin-Gorskii's extraordinary images available online for all the
   world to see.Â  Much new information about the sites shown in the
   photographs and fascinating pairings of then-and-now views are being
   gathered as a result. It's really Prokudin-Gorskii who gives us a
   birthday gift- the special pleasure of seeing a vanished world captured
   in color by a master photographer.

       Exceptional and very impressive. Thanks to Lynn Brooks et.al. for
       their good work in bringing this to us.

       Worthwhile colored images for the world to see, the brain-child of
       Lynn Brooks, an avid reader and genius, who doesn't waste time
       watching TV, but applies this short time of life on Earth to
       brilliant accomplishment.

       Lovely. Wish some american had been able to do as well in color
       during the same era.

       Many thanks to all for the appreciative comments! For a glimpse of
       the equipment Prokudin-Gorskii used, you might like to look at this
       page in the online exhibit:
       [27]http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/empire/making.html. We also
       celebrated the occasion by putting a [28]selection of the
       photographs up in the Library of Congress Flickr account, where
       additional comments and questions have provided an opportunity to
       highlight Prokudin-Gorskii's accomplishments.
