Description:

   Guy Lamolinara from the Library of Congress speaks with Sheila Miyoshi
   Jager, who will appear at the 2013 National Book Festival on September
   22, 2013, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.

Biography:

   Sheila Miyoshi Jager is chair of the Department of East Asian Studies
   at Oberlin College. Her first book on Korean nationalism was
   "Narratives of Nation Building in Korea: A Genealogy of Patriotism. She
   followed that with "Ruptured Histories: War, Memory and the Post-Cold
   War in Asia." Her new book focuses on a topic much in the news.
   "Brothers at War: The Unending Conflict in Korea" is a military,
   political and cultural history of the war, seen as spanning from 1945
   to the present, and its global impact told from the American, North and
   South Korean, Soviet-Russian and Chinese perspectives.
