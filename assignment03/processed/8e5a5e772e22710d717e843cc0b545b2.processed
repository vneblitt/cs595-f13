How to Make Healthy School Lunches for Your Children

   Being a parent often requires a non-stop juggling routine that begins
   with morning carpool and ends with bedtime stories. In the rush to get
   your children to school, it's important not to forget the value of
   preparing them a healthy lunch.

   It isn't as time consuming as it seems. LetsMove.gov, an initiative by
   First Lady Michelle Obama, offers good advice on [56]healthy eating for
   children. But you can also follow these easy tips:

   Switch white bread for whole grain: If sandwiches are a staple in your
   child's lunch, the easiest way to make a change is to substitute whole
   grain bread for white. There are many varieties out there to please
   even the pickiest eater. You can also substitute flour tortillas with
   wheat ones and white pita with whole grain. Fill them with proteins
   like turkey slices and cheese. If your child prefers warm food in a
   thermos, you can fill it with brown rice, whole grain pasta and even
   oatmeal.

   Pack a rainbow: [57]Fruits and vegetables are great sources of
   nutrition. Make fruits and vegetables more interesting. Pack green and
   purple grapes or colorful berries, dried apricots, mangos, cut red and
   orange peppers into strips and send them with a fun dipping sauce like
   hummus or yogurt and send oranges already peeled and sliced. The
   prettier the presentation, the higher the chances are your child will
   reach for it.

   Water, water, water: Juice may seem harmless, especially since the
   labels read things like "packed with fruit." But juice adds a lot of
   unnecessary sugar and calories to your child's diet. Consider
   [58]rethinking what they drink and send a bottle of water along with,
   or instead of, the juice box. Not only does drinking water eliminate
   extra sugar from their diet, but it also keeps children from getting
   dehydrated throughout the day. Low-fat milk is also a good idea since
   it provides calcium and protein.

   Think about temperature: Would you eat warm yogurt or cold rice? The
   temperature inside your child's lunchbox is just as important as what
   is inside. Keep hot foods warm by sending them in a thermos, it helps
   if you first fill it with boiling water for two minutes to retain some
   heat. Keep cold items like cheese or hardboiled eggs cool by using ice
   packs. You can also use a refillable water bottle filled with ice cubes
   to keep things fresh, plus it will provide drinking water at the same
   time!

   Plan ahead: Making a healthy lunch does take some thought, but the
   morning rush, when everyone's trying to get out the door, isn't the
   best time to get creative. Try to make a routine of packing some items
   the night before. Cutting up fruit, pre-making sandwiches, boiling
   whole grain pasta are all time-saving steps. Another good habit is to
   make [59]weekly shopping lists (PDF), so you're not stuck searching the
   cupboard for last-minute - and unhealthy - options.
