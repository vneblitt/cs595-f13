Watch: Wale's Music Video for Butt Anthem "Clappers"

   Posted by [86]Julian Kimble on Sep. 3, 2013 at 3:34 pm

   [EMBED]

   Wale tossed Stadium Club an alley-oop when he released his single
   "Clappers" this summer. With its thunderous intro, [87]EU sample, Chuck
   Brown shout-out, and guest appearances from Nicki Minaj and Juicy J,
   the track seemed like pabulum for both the strip-club set and the
   rapper's local fanbase. But he didn't release a video for the song
   until today, which seems to violate the laws of [88]summer jams.

   It's [89]not entirely clear why the video took so long to drop, but it
   probably wasn't related to a too-ambitious concept: This minimalist
   video does not pretend to be more complex than the song. It's got women
   in butt-enhancing attire, a cameo from Meek Mill, butts, butts,
   clapping, butts, and rappers alternately engaging and ignoring the
   butts. Fortunately, Nicki Minaj offers a bright spot with her gyrations
   and lyrics ("Got ass for days/Come activate/This ass on fire,
   evacuate").

       Unless you're recounting an unfortunate visit to Baja Fresh, the
       words "ass on fire" and "evacuate" should never be used in such
       close proximity.
