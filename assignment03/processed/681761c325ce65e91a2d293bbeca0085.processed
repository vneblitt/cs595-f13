   BLACKSBURG, Va., Sept. 12, 2013 - Sixteen Virginia Tech faculty,
   students, and alumni, joined by members of the local community will
   highlight the second [160]TEDxVirginiaTech event on Nov. 9, 2013, at
   the newly opened Center for the Arts.

   In the tradition of TED events, each speaker will share inspiring and
   thought-provoking ideas worth spreading. Each talk will focus on this
   year's TEDxVirginiaTech theme of moving "Beyond Boundaries." The event
   will take place from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.., and include several videos
   of previous TED speakers.

   Faculty, student, and community member tickets for the all-day event
   will go on sale in early October. Information on ticket prices and
   availability is forthcoming. The event will be presented by Virginia
   Tech's [161]Center for Instructional Development and Educational
   Research, [162]Institute for Creativity Arts and Technology, and
   [163]University Relations.

   "The Center for the Arts at Virginia Tech is the perfect venue to
   inspire `ideas worth spreading,'" said Melissa Richards, a
   co-chairwoman with the TEDxVirginiaTech executive committee and
   assistant vice president for marketing and publications for Virginia
   Tech.  "Faculty, staff, students, alumni, and community members will
   come together to hear authentic stories from people who think and do
   things `Beyond Boundaries' out of passion -- and hopefully be inspired
   to take action and make a difference."
   This year's event expands from 2012's [164]inaugural TEDxVirginiaTech
   event to include community members from the New River Valley who are
   not directly affiliated with the university. The organizing committee
   this year sought to broaden the TEDxVirginiaTech event as encompassing
   the university and all residents from the local area, said Richards.

   Started as a four-day conference in California 26 years ago, the
   nonprofit organization TED has grown to support those world-changing
   ideas with multiple initiatives. TEDx is a program of local,
   self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
   experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
   to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.

   Speakers for the 2013 TEDxVirginiaTech event and the title of their
   talk are, by category:

   Va., a doctoral student in the management program at the Virginia Tech
   [186]Pamplin College of Business. Matuszak was one of the featured
   speakers at the inaugural [187]TEDxVirginiaTech event, focusing his
   talk on "The Art of Improvisation: Preparing to be Unprepared."

   As with the 2012 event, there are many opportunities on the Virginia
   Tech campus, in the local community, and around the country with alumni
   chapters to attend a live streaming event of the day's talks. All the
   events will combine TEDTalks videos with live speakers to spark deep
   discussion and connection in small groups.

   Among Hokies that have spoken at the larger TED event are Dennis Hong,
   associate professor of mechanical engineering and founder/director of
   Virginia Tech's Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory and Regina Dugan, a
   two-time alumnus of the College of Engineering. Dugan served as
   director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA for
   short, from 2009 to 2012, and is now senior vice president of Motorola
   Mobility's Advanced Technology and Projects group.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event

   [192]TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring
   people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event,
   TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and
   connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are
   branded TEDx, where `x' means independently organized TED event. The
   TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
   individual TEDx events are self-organized, subject to certain rules and
   regulations.

About TED

   [193]TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading.
   Started as a conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to
   support those world-changing ideas with many initiatives.

   At a TED conference, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked
   to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes or less. TED speakers
   have included Roger Ebert, Sheryl Sandberg, Bill Gates, Elizabeth
   Gilbert, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Brian
   Greene, Isabel Allende and former United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon
   Brown. Three major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference
   takes place every spring in Vancouver, Canada, simultaneous with
   TEDActive, in Whistler, Brtitish Columbia; and the TEDGlobal Conference
   takes place each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.

   On TED.com, talks from TED conferences are shared with the world for
   free as TED Talks videos. A new TED Talk is posted every weekday.
   Through the Open Translation Project, TED Talks are subtitled by
   volunteers worldwide into more than 90 languages. Through our
   distribution networks, TED Talks are shared on TV, radio, Netflix, and
   many websites.

    The TEDx initiative grants free licenses to people around the world to
   organize TED-style events in their communities with TED Talks and live
   speakers. More than 5,000 TEDx events have been held, and selected
   talks from these events are also turned into TED Talks videos.

   The annual TED Prize grants $1 million to an exceptional individual
   with a wish to change the world. The TED Fellows program helps
   world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the
   TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their
   remarkable projects and activities. TED-Ed creates short video lessons
   by pairing master teachers with animators, for use in classroom
   instruction or independent learning.
