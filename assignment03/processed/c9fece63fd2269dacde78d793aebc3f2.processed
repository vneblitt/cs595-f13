Even a Flawed Plan Will Be Useful

   Jeffrey Lewis

   [36]Jeffrey Lewis is director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program
   at the Monterey Institute of International Studies.

   Updated September 11, 2013, 6:24 PM

   A plan to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles doesn't have to be
   perfect. But it will be better than any probable alternative.

   A number of commentators have noted the slow progress of the United
   States in eliminating its own stockpile of chemical weapons under the
   Chemical Weapons Convention. But the reasons are completely irrelevant
   to the situation in Syria. It reflects local politics in the United
   States of siting and operating chemical weapons incinerators. Local
   environmental groups in Syria will not slow the work of the United
   Nations and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons with
   [37]lawsuits.

     It will be difficult, but not impossible. And if Assad reneged on
     his commitments, the United States would be in a better position to
     use force.

   In fact, the international community has moved faster when it mattered.
   The United Nations Special Commission in Iraq supervised "the
   destruction of over 480,000 liters of live chemical weapons agent,
   28,000 chemical munitions and approximately 1.8 million liters, and
   over 1 million kilograms of some 45 different precursor chemicals" in a
   little less than two years -- from June 1992 to May 1994.

   Although it is hard to know the size of Syria's chemical weapons
   stockpile, estimates of 1,000 tons of various agents are pretty similar
   to [38]pre-1991 estimates in Iraq. This is not a dramatically different
   task, at least not in scale.>

   Prior to destruction, the United Nations consolidated Iraq's
   stockpiles. Consolidating Syria's chemical weapons stockpile would
   prevent their use by the military. The international community could
   consolidate Syria's chemical weapons in a third country, where
   destruction could occur at a more leisurely pace. Jordan, for example,
   has made clear its [39]preference for a diplomatic solution to this
   crisis. Here is Amman's chance to step up.

   I don't want to downplay the challenges of attempting to either destroy
   or remove chemical weapons stockpile in a situation as chaotic as war
   torn Syria. The inspectors who enter Syria will be taking real personal
   risks to make the world a safer place. But we're not asking them to do
   something impossible or futile.

   If we have the political will and reasonable expectations, a diplomatic
   solution offers a better way to reduce the threat from Syria's chemical
   weapons than any of the other options currently on the table.

   And if Assad were to renege on his commitments after surrender only a
   portion of the stockpile, the United States and its allies would be in
   a better legal and political position to use force, with fewer chemical
   weapons to target.
