'Baywatch' Star Alexandra Paul Strikes Peace Agreement With Alleged German
Stalker

   [29]Celebrity Justice
   9/15/2013 12:15 AM PDT [30]BY TMZ STAFF
   'Baywatch' Star
   Peace Deal
   With Alleged Stalker
   Exclusive
   0913_alexandra-paul_getty
   Former "Baywatch" star Alexandra Paul has withdrawn her restraining
   order against an overzealous German fan ... in a bizarrely friendly
   settlement.
   Here's the deal Alexandra struck with her alleged stalker ... in return
   for 86ing the restraining order, he doesn't communicate with her in any
   way, shape or form, and that includes letters, faxes or any other form
   of electronic communication.
   The two also agreed to stay 50 ft. away from each other at all times --
   unless they're at the gym they both frequent in Pacific Palisades ...
   or the pool at a nearby rec. center.  At those 2 locations, they have
   to stay 15 feet apart ... so no buddy sit ups.
   Here's the best part -- both say if they accidentally violate the rules
   ... they've agreed to immediately walk in separate directions.
   Note to Alexandra ... running is permitted.

   One of them can't switch to a different rec center? This is not going
   to end well and I have a bad feeling it will be Alexandra who regrets
   this 'amicable' settlement.

   There has to be more to the story. One or both sides could have
   misrepresented the nature of things...

   So, basically he is allowed to stalk, harass, scare and annoy her,
   perhaps kill her but not email or text her, and she agreed to this? And
   they go to the same gym? There has got to be more to this story...

   What a crock od s... Who drops a restraining order for a verbal
   agreement with a stalker? Why did she get one in the first place if she
   was willing to negotiate agreements with the stalker? Pathetic.

   Bad move. Now she's given him the acknowledgment he craves. With this
   stupid agreement, anyone would think he was her ex-boyfriend or
   something.

   First of all "the so called stalker" is a she ,according to the
   previous TMZ article...and her name. Second there is something not
   fitting together, what is she holding back? I don't believe the whole
   story ..and agree to Dawn and her comment accept that She must have had
   something going on with a woman.
