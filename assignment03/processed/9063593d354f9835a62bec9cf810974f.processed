Cicada 'invasion' bugs some, excites others

   A large group of cicadas rest on iris leaves. Cicadas infest spring
   irises.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., April 25, 2013 - Soon, parts of the East Coast will
   experience infestations of small beings with blood-orange bulging eyes
   and bodies that can generate noise as thunderous as roaring motorcycle
   engines. And let's not forget their preternatural disposition to make
   an appearance every 17 years.

   If this sounds like the treatment of a bad science fiction film from
   the 1950s, don't start rolling out the welcome mat for space invaders
   just yet -- we aren't talking about aliens from another planet.

   We're talking about the emergence of the 17-year cicadas, and this year
   we'll be welcoming Brood II of that club. Starting in early May, from
   North Carolina to New York, cicadas will be molting at a hardwood tree
   near you. In Virginia, they will mainly be in the Piedmont Region,
   which stretches from the falls of the Potomac River to the Blue Ridge
   Mountains.

   The sudden emergence of flaming-eyed insects that are so plentiful they
   crunch under your feet tends to evoke thoughts of plague and locusts
   (which they are not).

   But, these bugs look scarier than they really are.

   The sleepy cicadas nymphs wake up from their 17-year nap in May to come
   out and play, mate, and cause an aural ruckus. Beyond being nature's
   noisemakers, they are relatively harmless insects.

   "The only harm they could do is on very young trees with not
   well-established root systems. They don't eat leaves and they are not
   locusts," said Eric Day, manager of [160]Virginia Cooperative
   Extension's [161]Insect Identification Laboratory in the [162]College
   of Agriculture and Life Sciences' [163]Department of Entomology.

   Adult cicadas live for only two to four weeks during which time they
   eat relatively little and do not cause any severe damage. Male cicadas
   sing to attract females using a drum-like structure on the side of the
   abdomen called a tymbal.

   After mating, females lay small eggs in twigs that are one-quarter to
   one-half-inch in diameter. As many as several dozen eggs can be laid in
   one branch, with each female laying up to 400 eggs at 40 to 50 sites.
   Once the eggs hatch, the young cicadas -- or nymphs -- fall to the
   ground where they burrow six to18 inches underground and suck on tree
   root sap for the next 17 years.

   "Feeding on tree roots does not make them a pest," said Day. "They
   aerate the soil and birds opportunistically feed on them, so there is a
   kind of benefit."

   But why the 17-year slumber?

   "A long period between emergences is a deterrent to predators. You will
   typically see that they have very few predators or parasites," he said.

   Because it's difficult to have another cicada brood or predator match
   up to a prime number, this also means less competition for resources in
   the bug world.

   "You don't get broods overlapping geographically," he said.
   Despite their Paleozoic -- and some may say creepy -- appearance they
   are great ambassadors to the bug world.

   "They tend to be a gateway insect for amateur entomologists," said Day.
   "You get a lot of amateur entomologists that map them and collect
   them."

   In fact, Day speaks about the 17-year, or periodical, cicadas as
   astronomers might pine over the annual Perseid meteor shower or other
   celestial events that occur sparingly throughout a lifetime and
   disappear into the ether.

   "I have mixed emotions about their emergence. I don't like farmers or
   other people to have damage to their trees, but there are people that
   really like to see the cicadas," he said. "This only happens in Eastern
   North America."

   So, sit back and enjoy the spectacular emergence of arthropods that is
   about to beset us, folks. By and large cicadas are not harmful (some
   say they are even pretty tasty). And unlike celestial events, you won't
   have to stay up until the wee hours of the morning to enjoy cicada
   singing or marvel at their one-and-a-half-inch wing span.

   "People think this is an insect invasion," Day said.  "It's not an
   invasion -- they've been there all along."
