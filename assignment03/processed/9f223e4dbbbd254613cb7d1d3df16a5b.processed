   In the 22 years since Bobby Flay first appeared on the culinary
   landscape with the opening of his first restaurant, [40]Mesa Grill,
   he's expanded to 21 restaurants from New York to Las Vegas to the
   Caribbean. He also added six national TV cooking shows, such as
   Throwdown! with Bobby Flay and Grill It!, and 11 cookbooks to his
   résumé. "Wolfgang Puck taught us that food can be fun; it doesn't have
   to be a five-hour meal in a stodgy restaurant; it can be smoked salmon
   on a pizza," says Flay of his hero. "And that was the start of
   something great."

   His wife of eight years, actress Stephanie March, is equally as
   acclaimed and versatile. In addition to playing ADA Alexandra Cabot on
   the long-running hit series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit for 12
   seasons, she's also added travel writer, activist, and entrepreneur to
   her list of accomplishments. This fall, March is opening a beauty bar
   in Manhattan with her longtime makeup artist, Rebecca Perkins. In
   addition, she's visited such far-flung locales as Nepal and India in
   her work with [41]World of Children Award, a global organization that
   provides awareness and funding for life-changing work with children,
   and campaigned for [42]Planned Parenthood in her home state of Texas.
   "I've seen a lot of giving back, and all of it comes from a good place,
   but a lot of it is not administered effectively," says March. "I feel
   very strongly that the women of my home state deserve better
   representation and better care in the 21st century, and I'm not going
   to shut up until it happens."

   Here, March's L&O: SVU costar, actress Mariska Hargitay--who first
   introduced the couple in 2001--sits down with her longtime friends to
   talk new endeavors, trips to the Hamptons, and the all-important
   brunch.

   Mariska Hargitay: I actually feel like I'm interviewing family because
   I've acted with you, Stephanie, for 47 seasons, and then when you were
   done with me, you went and acted with my husband [actor Peter Hermann]
   on Broadway [in Talk Radio]. Stephanie, when you left the show, you
   started living my personal dream--you started traveling the world. I
   want to hear about that because now what I do for relaxation and fun is
   follow you on Instagram.
   Stephanie March: I've been pretty lucky in the last few years. I've
   been able to travel a lot for two organizations that are really close
   to my heart--World of Children Award and Planned Parenthood--and to
   write about them and explore how to give back globally. I've really
   enjoyed it.

   MH: Can you tell me about a favorite place you've been or a place that
   really surprised you?
   SM: My favorite place is always the place I just came back from, and my
   second favorite place is always the place I'm going next, whether I've
   been there or not. I just came back from Nepal and India with World of
   Children Award; we were checking on a clinic for children with muscular
   disabilities and a clinic that rehabilitates people who are the victims
   of sex trafficking. To be able to see what people are doing to make a
   difference is completely inspiring and has informed my global
   education. It's a significant part of my life, and Bobby has been
   super, super supportive, so I feel very lucky.

   MH: Bobby, you have a Midas touch and you make a burger like no one
   else. Your Southwestern food is unparalleled. Tell me what's new on the
   horizon.
   Bobby Flay: I had a restaurant called Bolo, which was a Spanish
   restaurant in New York, for 15 years. And about five years ago my lease
   was up, and they knocked the building down to build a 60-story
   condominium--[a classic] New York real estate story. I've been on the
   lookout for what the next version of Bolo will be, and I found a space
   a few months ago, and I'm building it now. It's going to be in Noho, on
   Lafayette Street, right off of Houston. But I'm going to call it Gato.
   It's going to be Spanish in thrust, but I'm going to utilize as much of
   the Mediterranean as I can to surround the Spanish idea. It's going to
   open after the first of the year.

   MH: Stephanie, Bobby's opening a new restaurant, and I understand that
   you have a new business--Rouge NY.
   SM: Rebecca Perkins, who used to be the key makeup artist for SVU, and
   I are partnering on a makeup salon called Rouge NY, and it will be on
   Thompson Street between Houston and Prince. For the last few years it's
   been relatively simple to walk into a salon and get your hair done just
   for an event, if you're updating your Facebook page, or you have a
   first date, but why is it so hard to get your makeup done? The only
   options [have been] knowing a makeup artist or going to the counter at
   the department store and being pressured into buying things you'll
   never use. This is the modern service for the professional girl.

   MH: I think it is brilliant, and I think there is such a need for it. I
   think about sitting next to you for many, many years in hair and makeup
   and watching you read The New Yorker cover to cover. What are you
   reading now?
   SM: I just finished this awesome book called The Interestings, by Meg
   Wolitzer. And I just started last night--it is a book my mom gave me
   for my birthday--a biography called Gertrude Bell: Queen of the Desert.
   Gertrude Bell is kind of my travel hero. She traveled all through the
   Middle East at the turn of the century on the arm of Lawrence of
   Arabia. She pioneered the effort to understand the people of the Middle
   East, and she's this travel badass at a time when very few women were
   allowed out of the house.

   MH: Who are your heroes, both personally and professionally?
   BF: Wolfgang Puck is the person I look up to because I really feel like
   he gave everyone in my generation a career. He revolutionized the way
   we look at food in this country. Interestingly, it took an Austrian to
   do it.
   SM: My answer used to be anyone who won an Academy Award, and over the
   years it's really changed. I think if I could be anybody else I would
   be Melinda Gates. She has it all. She is successful and brilliant and
   is giving back in such a way.... She has taken all this time spent in
   her professional life and turned it into a really unique force for
   legitimate change. Certainly I admire her.

   MH: I do want to ask you about your last trip to Texas--tell us about
   your work there.
   SM: My grandmother founded Planned Parenthood of West Texas; they asked
   me to speak in Houston, so I'm going to go. While the focus lately has
   been on the abortion debate, we're really focusing on healthcare for
   Texas women under the poverty line. Twenty percent of women in Texas
   use Planned Parenthood just as their primary care physician, which is a
   lot of people. I feel that the fight has continued in a way that many
   women my age could not have imagined, and certainly my mother's age
   could not have imagined.

   MH: How often do you cook for Bobby?
   SM: I would say never.
   BF: That's not true. Stephanie has a roster of, I'd say, about six or
   seven things that she makes incredibly well.
   SM: Six or seven? How about three or four, one of them being cereal?
   But that's super nice of you.

   MH: What do you guys do for dinner when you're home? Do you go out or
   do you cook?
   SM: About half and half. And when we cook at home, "we" being him, we
   eat pretty simply--grilled fish, grilled meat, salad.

   MH: Except brunch--I had brunch at your house, and I'm still dreaming
   about it.
   SM: Brunch gets more interesting because it's a savory-and-sweet
   situation.

   MH: Where do you eat in the Hamptons?
   SM: [43]Bostwick's and [44]Crow's Nest. Those have to be our two.
   BF: We also eat at [45]La Fondita and another good barbecue place,
   [46]Townline.

   MH: Bobby, what haven't you done professionally you feel that you need
   to do?
   BF: In the last couple of years I've really taken stock, and I like
   what I have right now. I have restaurants in New York and Las Vegas,
   Atlantic City, Connecticut, the Bahamas even--those are my high-end
   restaurants. Then I opened [47]Bobby's Burger Palace about five years
   ago--we have 15 of them and we're going to stop at 20. I want to redo
   what I've been doing my whole career as opposed to doing something new;
   for instance, redoing Bolo five years later, or the next version of it.
   Mesa Grill is going to close on August 31 after 22 years, but I want to
   redo that as well. You see a lot of chefs reaching for new things that
   they haven't done before, and that's wonderful, but I want to take a
   different path, which is redoing what I've done my whole life. When I
   opened Mesa Grill, I was 25; now when I reopen Mesa Grill, I'll be 48
   or 49, and I just think I'll have a completely different perspective.
   SM: When you say redo--it seems when you discuss menus with me, or
   design concepts which you are extremely involved in--it's more like
   revisiting. Imagine playing something in Shakespeare when you're too
   young to do it, and then getting the part 20 years later when you
   really know what you're doing and then just killing it. What an
   opportunity!
   BF: I look at Mesa Grill now, and it's as busy as it's ever been; the
   food is as good as it's ever been, but I still walk into it and I'm
   excited at the idea that there will be a different life for it, because
   I'll have a chance to basically start from scratch with the knowledge
   and experience I've had with food. A lot of people have asked me if I'm
   sad that Mesa Grill's going to close, and yes, of course I am. There's
   lots of sentimental value there. But at the same time, I'm just as
   excited to relaunch it.
