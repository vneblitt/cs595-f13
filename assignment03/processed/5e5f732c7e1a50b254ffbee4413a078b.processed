Number One Hits for the Year: 1979 by Billy Parrott, Mid-Manhattan Library,
Art and Picture Collections September 11, 2013

   I was recently going through a box of old photographs and came across
   photos from the first concert I ever attended: [127]Kiss. October 21,
   1979. Houston Summit. I was 10.

   That got me to thinking of the music from that year.

   1979 marked the end of arguably one of the most unfortunate eras in
   American music history: [128]Disco. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not a
   hater. I like all kinds of music and I can certainly appreciate the
   nostalgic sounds of mid-to-late 1970s popular music: the
   four-on-the-floor beat, the open hi-hat on the off-beat, the syncopated
   bass lines, and the lyrical cacophony all now synonymous with the
   disco. It's a guilty pleasure. I can watch [129]Saturday Night Fever
   repeatedly and never tire of it. One of the absolute best subway
   performances I have ever heard was an acoustic version of "How Deep is
   Your Love" on the Clinton Washington G platform about 10 years ago.
   That song isn't disco, but the [130]Bee Gees epitomized the genre. It's
   all good. But all good things must come to an end. The fashion, the
   dancing, all that hair... It had to come to an end sooner or later.
   Enough was enough.

   On June 1, 1979 Get the Knack was released.

   Most critics place [131]The Knack into the one-hit wonders category
   populated by the likes of M, whose only hit "[132]Pop Muzik" reached #1
   on November 3, 1979. But Get the Knack was much more. It was a final
   nail in the coffin. It was a beginning and an end. It was 12 tracks of
   infectious confectionary rock candy that rocketed to the top of the
   charts, for six straight weeks, displacing the likes of [133]Donna
   Summers from the position she was all too familiar with. Disco's death
   rattle continued for a while, but the writing was on the wall. The
   Queen was dead. Long live the Queen.

   Many of the over 50 #1 hits from 1979 were disco. Some rockers even got
   into the genre. [134]Rod Stewart was at #1 for four straight weeks with
   "[135]Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" The drums and bass in that song?
   Definitely disco. If you've never heard the 1972 [136]Jorge Ben Jor
   song "[137]Taj Mahal" give it a listen. It's got the familiar
   four-on-the-floor beat and a chorus melody that Rob Stewart blatantly
   "borrowed". Stewart was sued, lost, and donated all his royalties from
   the song to the United Nations Children's Fund.

   [138]Kiss also got into the groove. The first single from 1979's
   [139]Dynasty was "I Was Made for Lovin' You". It made it to #11 on the
   US charts. To many fans' dismay, it was definitely disco.

   Other #1 standouts for the year: "[140]Heart of Glass" by [141]Blondie
   and [142]Michael Jackson's "[143]Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough". Those
   songs have definitely stood the test of time. [144]Styx had their first
   number one hit with a ballad. [145]Eagles also made an appearance.
   [146]The Doobie Brothers reached #1 on April 14th with "[147]What a
   Fool Believes". It went on to win for song and album of the year. That
   song, co-written by [148]Kenny Loggins, is now a perfect example of the
   [149]Yacht Rock genre of the late 70s. Another great example of 70s
   genre music was the #1 song from the last 2 weeks of 1979:
   "[150]Escape" by Rupert Holmes, better known as the Pina Colada Song.

   Below are the [151]Billboard Hot 100 number one hits of 1979. There
   were countless great tunes that did not make it to number one that
   year: "[152]The Devil Went Down to Georgia" (Granny, does your dog
   bite? No child, No), "[153]The Sultans of Swing" (They don't give a
   damn 'bout any trumpet playing band), "[154]Dance the Night Away" (Yes,
   It's love in the third degree), the live version of "[155]I Want You To
   Want Me" recorded in Budokan (Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you
   cryin), "[156]Don't Bring Me Down" ([157]Bruce!).

   It was an amazing year for music! What are some of your favorites from

[206]Roller skates, 45s and the Clash!

   Submitted by Elizabeth Waters on September 11, 2013 at 1:28 PM.

   Every time I hear "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough," I feel like
   breaking out the roller skates. My friends and I would bring a boom box
   down to the storage room in our building and skate away to Michael
   Jackson's "Off the Wall" album. We were big fans of the Saturday night
   Fever soundtrack, too, although none of us were allowed to see the
   R-rated film at the time. I remember listening to my brother's 45 of
   "My Sharona" but we didn't have the LP, so I don't think I've ever
   heard any other Knack song.

   It didn't produce any number 1 hits in the U.S., but for my money, the
   best album released in 1979 was "London Calling" by the Clash although
   I didn't realize it at the time (being too occupied with disco roller
   skating.) It still sounds fresh and amazes me every time I listen to it
   and might be my single desert island pick if I had to choose one. And
   1979 is when the Two Tone label in the U.K. brought us The Specials,
   Madness, The Beat. Ska, ska, ska!

   Thanks for conjuring some pleasant memories (although I could have done
   without the flashback to the Piña Colada Song ;-)

[210]I love the 70s

   Submitted by Andrea on September 12, 2013 at 3:56 PM.

   My younger sister Allison was born in 1979. The year was filled with
   totally rocking tunes. The disco craze was dying and it showed in the
   charts. But 1979 gave us some awesome tunes. My faves were Bad Girls,
   Hot Stuff, Love You Inside Out, Fire, Sad Eyes, and We Are Family.

[212]awesome tunes indeed

   Submitted by Billy Parrott on September 13, 2013 at 8:23 AM.

   ...and diverse! 1979 gave us "Spirit of Radio" from Rush, "September"
   by Earth, Wind, and Fire, "Hold the Line" from Toto, "Cars" by Gary
   Numan, and "The Gambler" from Kenny Rogers, who single-handedly
   inspired more trends in facial hair and hairstyles then any other man
   that year!
