   Governor Chris Christie Manasquan Town Hall
   March 21, 2013 (Transcript Below)
   Governor Christie: For me and for Mary Pat, you know, this has always
   been home for me, but it's home for her now too, and home for our
   children. We're raising all four of them here, and we hope that they
   stay here and that they raise their children here, and this is a
   turning point for our state. The mission is to make this state a place
   where our children and our grandchildren are going to want to raise
   their children and grandchildren, that these streets that we've walked
   along in our hometowns, where we had our hands held by our parents and
   grandparents, that those streets are going to be the kind of streets
   that our kids and grandkids are going to want to walk their children
   around. That's what makes New Jersey special, is that connection
   between the past and the future, and our job in this mission that we
   have to get our state back is to make sure that that's still there. For
   many places in our state it will never be the same, will never be the
   same in some parts of our state, but it can be better. It can be better
   if we do this job and we do it the right way.
