   Adults reported drinking and driving about 112 million times in 2010.

   85% of drinking and driving episodes were reported by binge drinkers.

   Four in 5 people who drink and drive are men.

   US adults drank too much and got behind the wheel about 112 million
   times in 2010. Though episodes of driving after drinking too much
   ("drinking and driving") have gone down by 30% during the past 5 years,
   it remains a serious problem in the US. Alcohol-impaired drivers* are
   involved in about 1 in 3 crash deaths, resulting in nearly 11,000
   deaths in 2009.

   Driving drunk is never OK. Choose not to drink and drive and help
   others do the same.

   *These drivers had blood alcohol concentrations of at least 0.08%. This
   is the illegal blood alcohol concentration level for adult drivers in
   the United States.

Problem

People who drink and drive put everyone on the road in danger

   Certain groups are more likely to drink and drive than others.
     * Men were responsible for 4 in 5 episodes (81%) of drinking and
       driving in 2010.
     * Young men ages 21-34 made up only 11% of the U.S. adult population
       in 2010, yet were responsible for 32% of all instances of drinking
       and driving.
     * 85% of drinking and driving episodes were reported by people who
       also reported binge drinking. Binge drinking means 5 or more drinks
       for men or 4 or more drinks for women during a short period of
       time.

Your best defense against a drunk driver is to buckle up every time.

     * Every person in every seat should be buckled up on every trip. Seat
       belts reduce serious injuries and deaths from crashes by about 50%.
     * Primary enforcement seat belt laws allow police to stop vehicles
       just because someone is not wearing a seat belt. These state laws
       are effective in increasing seat belt use.

   There are proven ways to prevent people from drinking and driving.
     * At sobriety checkpoints, police stop drivers to judge if they are
       driving under the influence of alcohol. More widespread, frequent
       use of these checkpoints could save about 1,500 to 3,000 lives on
       the road each year.
     * Minimum legal drinking age laws prohibit selling alcohol to people
       under age 21 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Keeping
       and enforcing 21 as the minimum legal drinking age helps keep
       young, inexperienced drivers from drinking and driving.
     * Ignition interlocks prevent drivers who were convicted of
       alcohol-impaired driving from operating their vehicles if they have
       been drinking. Interlocks are effective in reducing re-arrest rates
       from drinking and driving by about two-thirds while the device is
       on the vehicle.

   but they put everyone on the road at risk.

What Can Be Done

   Icon: Building

States can:

     * Enforce 0.08% blood alcohol concentration and minimum legal
       drinking age laws.
     * Expand the use of sobriety checkpoints.
     * Require ignition interlocks for everyone convicted of drinking and
       driving, starting with their first offense.
     * Consider including strategies to reduce binge drinking--such as
       increasing alcohol taxes--to reduce drinking and driving, since the
       two behaviors are linked.
     * Pass primary enforcement seat belt laws that cover everyone in the
       car.

   Icon: Employers

Employers can:

     * Set policies that immediately take away all work-related driving
       privileges for any employee cited for drinking and driving while
       using a company or personal vehicle for work purposes.
     * Use workplace health promotion programs to communicate the dangers
       of drinking and driving, including information directed to family
       members.

   Healthcare professionals

Health professionals can:

     * Help patients realize that car crashes are the leading cause of
       death for everyone ages 5-34 and that 1 in 3 crash deaths involves
       a drunk driver.
     * Routinely screen patients for risky drinking patterns, including
       binge drinking, and provide a brief intervention--a 10-15 minute
       counseling session--for patients who screen positive.

   Icon: People

Everyone can:

     * Choose not to drink and drive and help others do the same.
          + Before drinking, designate a nondrinking driver when with a
            group.
          + If out drinking, get a ride home or call a taxi.
          + Don't let friends drink and drive.
     * Choose not to binge drink themselves and help others not to do it.
     * Talk with a doctor or nurse about drinking and driving and request
       counseling if drinking is causing health, work, or social problems.
     * Buckle up every time, no matter how short the trip. Encourage
       passengers in the car to buckle up, including those in the back
       seat.
