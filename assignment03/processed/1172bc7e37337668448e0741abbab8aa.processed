   Staff report

   2:16 p.m. CDT, September 13, 2013

   A judge denied bail today for a South Side man accused of killing
   another man after arguing with him and telling him, "I'll be back with
   my gun," according to police.

   Today in court Judge Israel Desierto denied bail for Victor Willis, 22,
   of the 5700 block of South Michigan Avenue, who has been charged with
   murder, according to authorities.

   John Wallace, 25, was shot dead around 11:30 p.m. on Sept. 1 in the
   6400 block of South Morgan Street in the Englewood neighborhood, police
   said. He and Willis had argued while on the porch and Willis left
   saying: "I'll be back with my gun,'' police said.

   In court, Asst. States' attorney Bridget O'Brien said the slaying
   happened as one of two witnesses was hanging out on a front porch where
   they both live at the Morgan Street address. A still-uncharged suspect
   came to the home with his girlfriend and he began taunting the witness
   about a previous fight that the two witnesses had been involved in over
   a girl they both knew, according to O'Brien.

   When a second witness told everyone to leave the porch, the uncharged
   suspect got mad and left with his girlfriend in a van. But a few
   minutes later, he came back with Willis in the same van, being driven
   by his girlfriend, O'Brien said.
   One of the witnesses was now sitting on a porch across the street and
   saw Willis, who he knows as "Vic" wearing a red hoodie and holding a
   handgun with an extended clip as Willis and the uncharged suspect
   exited the van and approached the porch, according to O'Brien.

   The victim, who was not involved in the prior altercations and "just
   happened" to be there at the time, answered the door. When he refused
   to tell Willis where one of the witnesses was, Willis began firing
   several shots into the building hitting the victim five times, before
   entering the home, raising the gun, and still firing, according to
   O'Brien.

   The co-defendants fled and Willis was arrested on Sept. 11 and
   positively identified as the shooter.

   In 2009, Willis was convicted of a possession of a stolen motor vehicle
   for which he was given two years probation. He also has two failure to
   appear violations, prosecutors said.
