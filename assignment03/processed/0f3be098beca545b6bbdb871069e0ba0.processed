Heart failure

A radical anti-abortion bill is back, subjecting Ohio women's rights to
politics and extremist ideology

   The "heartbeat" anti-abortion bill is back before Ohio's General
   Assembly, as radical, overreaching, and unconstitutional as ever. It
   should not become law.

   State lawmakers can't be bothered to interrupt their summer vacations
   to return to Columbus and vote to expand Ohio's Medicaid program. That
   would save state taxpayers money while making health insurance
   available to 275,000 more working-poor Ohioans.

   But some grandstanding GOP lawmakers can't wait to restrict the
   reproductive rights of Ohio women even further. The measure they
   propose stands little chance of ever taking effect. In the meantime,
   though, it may offer incumbent lawmakers some protection from primary
   election contests next year with even more-extreme challengers.

   The bill would prohibit abortion of a fetus with a detectable
   heartbeat. That can happen as early as six weeks after conception --
   sometimes before a woman even knows she is pregnant.

   Supporters say the bill would impose the toughest restrictions on
   abortion of any state. They insist they are untroubled by the fact that
   the measure would defy the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 ruling in
   Roe vs. Wade, which defines a constitutional right to abortion until a
   fetus can survive outside the womb.

   Such fetal viability generally does not occur until about the 24th week
   of pregnancy. In recent weeks, federal judges in North Dakota and
   Arkansas have thrown out or held up similar anti-abortion laws enacted
   in those states.

   Advocates of Ohio's heartbeat bill acknowledge they are looking for a
   court challenge of the measure, should it pass. They say they want a
   vehicle that would enable the current Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs.
   Wade.

   But legal scholars say that's unlikely. Although the high court has
   upheld some restrictions on abortion since the 1973 ruling, they note
   that justices have maintained the fetal-viability precedent.

   So a legal challenge on those grounds, such as the heartbeat bill would
   provide, could end up affirming and even strengthening Roe vs. Wade
   rather than reversing it. That's the fear of a number of the state's
   most prominent anti-abortion groups, such as Right to Life of Ohio and
   the Catholic Conference of Ohio.

   That's why they are keeping their distance from the heartbeat bill.
   Gov. John Kasich, who cited his "pro-life" stance when he signed a
   state budget that includes numerous new restrictions on abortion
   rights, isn't taking a position on the heartbeat bill.

   That new budget could force clinics that perform abortions to close
   across Ohio; Toledo may soon lose its sole remaining clinic. The budget
   tells doctors how they must treat their pregnant patients, or face
   prosecution.

   It punishes Planned Parenthood for its advocacy of reproductive rights
   by seeking to deny the group federal funding for family planning
   services. Columbus' war on women needs to end, not to expand.

   If anti-abortion lawmakers want to campaign for re-election and pander
   to anti-abortion extremists, let them do so without threatening a waste
   of taxpayer money in a futile court battle to defend an
   unconstitutional law.

   The state House passed the heartbeat bill in the past legislative
   session, but then-Senate President Tom Niehaus did not hold a vote on
   it in his chamber. Mr. Niehaus is gone, but similar good sense needs to
   prevail again.
