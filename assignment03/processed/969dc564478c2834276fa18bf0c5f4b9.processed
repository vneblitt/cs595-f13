Description

   This edition of Point draws from The New York Public Library's Lunch
   Hour NYC exhibition (June 2012 - February 2013) to look back at more
   than a century of lunches: when New York's early power brokers invented
   what was yet to be called "power lunch," when local charities
   established a three- cent school lunch, and when visitors with
   guidebooks thronged Times Square to eat lunch at the Automat. Food is a
   mirror on ourselves: it reflects the people who cook it and the people
   who eat it. Work-obsessed, time-obsessed, and in love with ingenious
   new ways to make money, the city reinvented lunch in its own image.
