TELANDER: Frenzy surrounding Northwestern is well-earned and well-deserved

       Come on now

   Updated: September 10, 2013 11:19PM

   You can feel it in the parking lots around Ryan Field (Dyche Stadium
   forever to us old-timers) before Northwestern games these days.

   Actual tailgating!

   Festiveness!

   Little kids chasing purple footballs crashing into card tables adorned
   with hot dogs, bouquets and beverages.

   Like it was learned from a manual dispensed by Alabama, Oregon, LSU,
   Ohio State and almost every other Big Ten team.

   It's in the air in Evanston, and it's not ragweed pollen or SAT
   confetti.

   It's old-fashioned college football madness, something not truly felt
   on the Evanston campus over a sustained period since the
   early-1960s/Ara Parseghian regime. And maybe not even then.

   College football in America just keeps ratcheting itself higher and
   higher on the entertainment, revenue-production scale until it has come
   to resemble something as formidable as the mighty NFL itself.

   But Northwestern has generally been left outside the surge.

   Not now. The Wildcats are coming off a season in which they went 10-3,
   won the Gator Bowl, and have both of their stellar alternating
   quarterbacks -- one a runner, one a thrower --back, intact and
   improved.

   The Cats are currently 2-0, having beaten Cal and Syracuse by scores of
   44-30 and 48-27. To be averaging 46 points, even if it's before the
   conference schedule, is a thing of beauty for the smallest and only
   private school in the Big Ten (soon to have 14 teams and probably no
   name change).

   But it's not just the offense, powered by thick-necked linemen Jack
   Konopka, Brandon Vitabile and Paul Jorgensen and those rotating
   quarterbacks, Kain Colter and Trevor Siemian. Nor is it the trembling
   excitement Cats fans feel whenever the ball is directed toward little
   speedball Venric Mark.

   It's the combined effect of the larger picture -- having to sustain
   actual college course attendance and passing grades while playing D-I
   ball (most of the time); the real-world value of a full ride to NU
   (worth up to $300,000 for a redshirt-to-grad-student player); the
   knowledge for high school studs that Northwestern is for real and that
   young fireball coach Pat Fitzgerald is the man -- that translates into
   frenzy.

   People don't say the word Northwestern in athletic embarrassment
   anymore. Fresh Chris Collins in men's hoops, women's lacrosse
   championships everywhere... No, it's not clear what is northwestern
   about Northwestern, but then who is the Stanford in Stanford? The
   school's name rises with the success of the color purple, a hue that is
   unusual but only red and blue combined.

   The football schedule leads to an early showdown of potentially crazy
   proportions -- Game 5 on Oct. 5 at Ryan/Dyche against the Evil Empire
   known as Ohio State. By that time the Cats should be undefeated, having
   dispensed with Western Michigan this Saturday and Maine on Sept. 21,
   and Ohio State should be 5-0, if it can get past Wisconsin Sept. 28.

   Here's the slick part: Northwestern has a bye after Maine and will have
   two weeks to heal and game plan for the Buckeyes. If the Cats have any
   educational edge over any public school, it should come in endless
   breakdown of Ohio State film and eggheaded analysis of what makes the
   fourth-ranked Buckeyes tick.

   Northwestern is a happy story. That may be a huge part of the
   excitement level as well. While tales of player crimes and coaching
   larceny fill student newspapers on a weekly basis, NU avoids the
   blotter news, the coach-as-thief immorality that makes a place like,
   say, Oklahoma State, seem like a reform school gone wild.

   This is not to say Fitzgerald and athletics vice president Jim Phillips
   are saints, only that an outlaw program, this is not. There were many
   Cal fans, for instance, including new coach Sonny Dykes, who were
   disgusted with the array of ``injured'' Northwestern defensive players
   who sat down afield and slowed the Bears' fast-twitch attack.

   Dubious? Yes. Illegal? No.

   You have Vanderbilt -- another private, high-standard school --
   dismissing four players and suspending a fifth for an alleged rape, and
   you know such an incident would kill the momentum that Fitzgerald has
   built.

   He is, as Phillips has called him, the ``rock star'' of college
   coaching. That's a precious title in a realm where high school kids
   tweet and text their every musical -- and athletic -- thought.

   Northwestern as contender for the Big Ten title, maybe even a BCS game?
   The images are sweet, thrilling. If done the right way.

   And those thoughts have people jazzed around Ryan/Dyche.

   Imagine, there were over 38,000 fans at the Syracuse game. That's
   nothing like Michigan's bazillion at the Big House for its Notre Dame
   matchup, but it's huge for a ``meaningless'' game for the Purple.

   Maybe Texas A&M's Johnny Manziel has a CBS ``Johnny Cam'' following him
   nonstop, but Northwestern, at least, is Chicago's Big Ten team.

   That's something.

   And Fitz is It.
