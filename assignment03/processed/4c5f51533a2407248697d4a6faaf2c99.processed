Transparent artificial muscle plays music

Gel-based audio speaker demonstrates capabilities of ionic conductors, long
thought limited in application

   August 29, 2013 | Editor's Pick Audio/Video
   By Caroline Perry, SEAS Communications

   In a materials science laboratory at Harvard, a transparent disk
   connected to a laptop fills the room with music -- it's the "Morning"
   prelude from "Peer Gynt" played on an ionic speaker.

   No ordinary speaker, it consists of a thin sheet of rubber sandwiched
   between two layers of a saltwater gel, and it's as clear as glass. A
   high-voltage signal that runs across the surfaces and through the
   layers forces the rubber to rapidly contract and vibrate, producing
   sounds that span the entire audible spectrum, 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz.

   But this is not an electronic device, nor has it ever been seen before.
   As described in a paper published in the Aug. 30 issue of [83]Science,
   it represents the first demonstration that electrical charges carried
   by ions, rather than electrons, can be put to meaningful use in
   fast-moving, high-voltage devices.

   "Ionic conductors could replace certain electronic systems; they even
   offer several advantages," says co-lead author Jeong-Yun Sun, a
   postdoctoral fellow at the [84]Harvard School of Engineering and
   Applied Sciences (SEAS).

   For example, ionic conductors can be stretched to many times their
   normal area without an increase in resistivity -- a problem common in
   stretchable electronic devices. Secondly, they can be transparent,
   making them well-suited for optical applications. Thirdly, the gels
   used as electrolytes are biocompatible, so it would be relatively easy
   to incorporate ionic devices -- such as artificial muscles or skin --
   into biological systems.

   conductive material that is very stretchy and completely transparent.

   After all, signals carried by charged ions are the electricity of the
   human body, allowing neurons to share knowledge and spurring the heart
   to beat. Bioengineers would love to mesh artificial organs and limbs
   with that system.

   "The big vision is soft machines," said co-lead author Christoph
   Keplinger, who worked on the project as a postdoctoral fellow at
   SEAS and in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology.
   "Engineered ionic systems can achieve a lot of functions that our body
   has: They can sense, they can conduct a signal, and they can actuate
   movement. We're really approaching the type of soft machine that
   biology has to offer."

   The audio speaker represents proof of concept for ionic conductors
   because producing sounds across the entire audible spectrum requires
   both high voltage (to squeeze hard on the rubber layer) and high-speed
   actuation (to vibrate quickly) -- two criteria that are important for
   applications but that would have ruled out the use of ionic conductors
   in the past.

   The traditional constraints are well known: High voltages can set off
   electrochemical reactions in ionic materials, producing gases and
   burning up the materials. Ions are also much larger and heavier than
   electrons, so physically moving them through a circuit is typically
   slow. The system invented at Harvard overcomes both of these problems,
   opening up a vast number of potential applications including not just
   biomedical devices, but also fast-moving robotics and adaptive optics.

   "It must seem counterintuitive to many people, that ionic conductors
   could be used in a system that requires very fast actuation, like our
   speaker," said Sun. "Yet by exploiting the rubber layer as an
   insulator, we're able to control the voltage at the interfaces where
   the gel connects to the electrodes, so we don't have to worry about
   unwanted chemical reactions. The input signal is an alternating
   current, and we use the rubber sheet as a capacitor, which blocks the
   flow of charge carriers through the circuit. As a result, we don't have
   to continuously move the ions in one direction, which would be slow; we
   simply redistribute them, which we can do thousands of times per
   second."

   Sun works in a research group led by [85]Zhigang Suo, the Allen E. and
   Marilyn M. Puckett Professor of Mechanics and Materials at SEAS. An
   expert in the mechanical behaviors of materials, Suo is also a Kavli
   Scholar at the [86]Kavli Institute for Bionano Science & Technology,
   which is based at SEAS.

   Suo teamed up with [87]George M. Whitesides, a prominent chemist who
   specializes in soft machines, among many other topics. Whitesides is
   the Woodford L. and Ann A. Flowers University Professor in the
   Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, co-director of the Kavli
   Institute at Harvard, and a core faculty member at the [88]Wyss
   Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard.

   "We'd like to change people's attitudes about where ionics can be
   used," said Keplinger, who now works in Whitesides' research group.
   "Our system doesn't need a lot of power, and you can integrate it
   anywhere you would need a soft, transparent layer that deforms in
   response to electrical stimuli -- for example, on the screen of a TV,
   laptop, or smartphone to generate sound or provide localized haptic
   feedback -- and people are even thinking about smart windows. You could
   potentially place this speaker on a window and achieve active noise
   cancellation, with complete silence inside."

   [89]Sam Liss, director of business development in Harvard's [90]Office
   of Technology Development, is working closely with the Suo and
   Whitesides labs to commercialize the technology. Their plan is to work
   with companies in a range of product categories, including tablet
   computing, smartphones, wearable electronics, consumer audio devices,
   and adaptive optics.

   "With wearable computing devices becoming a reality, you could imagine
   eventually having a pair of glasses that toggles between wide-angle,
   telephoto, or reading modes based on voice commands or gestures,"
   suggested Liss.

   For now, there is much more engineering and chemistry work to be done.
   The Harvard team chose to make its audio speaker out of very simple
   materials -- the electrolyte is a polyacrylamide gel swollen with salt
   water -- but they emphasize that an entire class of ionically
   conductive materials is available for experimentation. Future work will
   focus on identifying the best combinations of materials for
   compatibility, long life, and adhesion between the layers.

   In addition to Keplinger, Sun, Whitesides, and Suo, coauthors included
   Keith Choon Chiang Foo, a former postdoctoral fellow at SEAS, now at
   the Institute of High Performance Computing in Singapore; and Philipp
   Rothemund, a graduate student at SEAS.

   This research was supported by the National Science Foundation through
   a grant to the [91]Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at
   Harvard University and by the Army Research Office. It was also enabled
   in part by the Department of Energy and the Agency for Science,
   Technology, and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore.
