   efforts. Photo credit: Rob Fleischer

   CCEG scientists are at the forefront of the emerging fields of
   evolutionary and conservation genetics. They were the first to analyze
   and document the decrease in survival and reproductive success caused
   by inbreeding in zoo animals, and took the lead in developing solutions
   such as software for [105]genetic management. They were among the first
   to develop methods of [106]non-invasive genotyping to identify species
   and individuals, and to estimate kinship and population sizes of
   animals in natural populations. They developed novel [107]ancient DNA
   protocols and were pioneers in applying these methods to issues of
   conservation importance, as well as to unraveling the evolutionary
   histories of extinct and endangered species. And they have been leaders
   in applying genetic methods to diagnose and study emerging pathogens
   responsible for sometimes devastating [108]wildlife diseases.

   CCEG works to understand and conserve biodiversity through genetic
   research. It applies genetic theory and methods creatively to gain
   knowledge about the evolutionary and life histories of animals, to
   understand the importance of genetic variation to their survival, and
   to identify the methods needed to sustain them in captivity and the
   wild.

   CCEG research projects involve a broad methodological repertoire, often
   including field studies, DNA laboratory, theoretical and genetic
   management analyses. Many CCEG research studies are collaborative with
   other scientists at the National Zoo, National Museum of Natural
   History, elsewhere at the Smithsonian, and with other zoo and academic
   researchers. CCEG provides important service to the National Zoo and
   conservation community by developing genetic management plans for
   animals in zoos around the world, providing advice to agencies and
   non-governmental organizations, and applying molecular genetic methods
   to [109]document conservation management units and identify individual
   gender, [110]kin relationships, and pathogens. CCEG scientists also
   participate in scientific training and outreach; teaching students and
   the public about conservation biology and how genetic theory and
   methods contribute to its ends.

Research Programs

[111]Genetic Management of Wild and Captive Populations

   [112]Golden Lion Tamarin; Clyde Nishimura

   Genetic deterioration due to inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity
   is a very real problem that increases the risk of extinction in both
   wild and zoo populations. CCEG scientists have long been leaders in
   developing the science and tools for genetic management of endangered
   species [113]Learn more.

[114]Non-invasive DNA Techniques

   [115]African Elephant; Marissa Alhering

   To conserve endangered species effectively, scientists and managers
   need basic information  such as where the animals live  and how many of
   them there are. However, many endangered species are hard to find and
   even harder to count because they are rare and often secretive. CCEG
   has developed genetic methods for obtaining reliable information on
   many elusive endangered species by analyzing DNA extracted from feces,
   hair, and other items shed in the wild. [116]Learn more.

[117]Ancient DNA

   [118]Nukupuu; Rob Fleischer

   It is often difficult or impossible to obtain materials suitable for
   traditional DNA analysis from endangered and extinct species. In this
   case, CCEG's genetics laboratory has optimized a set of careful,
   controlled protocols to isolate and analyze DNA from older materials
   including museum specimens, mineralized bones (bones that aren't
   completely fossilized), and archaeological artifacts. [119]Learn
   more.

[120]Systematics and Definition of Conservation Units

   [121]Indian Wolf; Yadendradev Jhala

   Conservation strategies require knowing the taxonomic units that are to
   be preserved and how unique they are. Is a population a distinct
   subspecies or species? How much gene flow is there between two
   geographically isolated populations? How different are populations or
   species and which one's extinction would most impact genetic diversity?
   DNA analyses can be extremely useful for answering these types of
   questions. [122]Learn more.

[123]Disease Diagnosis and Dynamics

   [124]Hawaiian avian malaria; Rob Fleischer

   Emerging diseases can be devastating to wildlife, both in nature and in
   zoos, and some of these epizootic (epidemic) diseases have also become
   major health problems for humans. CCEG studies the effects of
   pathogenic organisms on wildlife, and develops and applies molecular
   methods for diagnosing diseases and determining genetic variation in a
   wide range of pathogen types. [125]Learn more.

[126]Genetic Applications to Understanding Animal Behavior and Ecology

   [127]Common loon

   Studies of animal behavior and ecology can benefit from the use of
   genetic methods. Scientists can use genetic data to estimate the level
   of kinship of individuals, which can be used to help explain the
   behaviors of individuals in families and expanded social groups. CCEG
   has participated in numerous collaborative studies of behavior with NZP
   and other scientists. [128]Learn more.

Recent Findings

SCBI Studies Show Habitat Fragmentation Affects Gene Flow in Indiaâs Leopard
and Tiger Populations

   [Leopard_Sandeep_Trishna.jpg]

   Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute scientists analyzed the
   genes of these great cats in the Satpura-Maikal landscapeâa 15,000
   square kilometers area composed of four interconnected reserves: Kanha,
   Satpura, Melghat and Pench. From April-June 2009 and November 2009-May
   2010, they collected scat (fecal matter) and hair samples for DNA
   analysis. This data, combined with Indiaâs forest ecology history,
   enabled SCBI scientists to construct a definitive picture of how
   habitat loss affects the genetic diversity and gene flow of cat
   populations. Published in Evolutionary Applications and Proceedings of
   the Royal Society B, their research demonstrates that an intact forest
   corridor is vital for maintaining gene flow in these great cats.

New Genetics Research on Leopards and Tigers in India Underscores the
Importance of Protecting Forest Corridors

   [Leopard_Sandeep_Trishna.jpg]

   As rapid economic expansion continues to shape the Asian landscape on
   which many species depend, time is running out for conservationists
   aiming to save wildlife such as tigers and leopards. Scientists at the
   Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute have used genetic analysis
   to find that the natural forest corridors in India are essential to
   ensuring a future for these species. According to two studies recently
   published in two papers, these corridors are successfully connecting
   populations of tigers and leopards to ensure genetic diversity and gene
   flow. [130]more
