Library digitizes student notebooks from transitional law school

   "Until there is a Charter given from Heaven to our Sea Captains," one
   1803 notebook entry reads, "I shall doubt their wright to separate
   father & mother brother & sister, bear them into foreign climes, there
   to linger out a miserable existance in servitude & despair."
   By Corydon Ireland, Harvard Staff Writer

   In 1812, a Connecticut law student named Samuel Cheever summarized a
   lecture on "Baron and Feme," which were the legal terms for husband and
   wife. Toward the top, in Cheever's slanted script, is a sentence that
   seems chilling now: "The husband acquires an absolute right over all
   the property of the wife in possession, and her right is entirely
   destroyed."

   Such were the lessons taught 200 years ago to apprentice lawyers,
   points that are of interest to scholars of legal history or to anyone
   simply eager for an intimate glimpse into a vanished past.

   Cheever's jottings are among a [83]collection of recently digitized
   student notebooks from the [84]Litchfield Law School (1784-1833). The
   original holdings are from the Harvard Law School Library's historical
   and special collections: 64 bound volumes of notebooks drafted by 17
   students from 1803-1825.

   Litchfield is generally regarded as the first formal private law school
   in the United States. It offered no degrees, and after a program of
   lectures its students still went on to apprenticeships. But instruction
   at Litchfield went beyond anything that had come before. The College of
   William and Mary had offered lectures in law earlier, but they were
   intended as a part of a general education.

   Litchfield's student body included a surprising number of college
   graduates. Their notebooks -- typically fine copies of class notes --
   are today scattered throughout university and museum archives. Most are
   at the [85]Litchfield Historical Society and at Yale Law School, said
   [86]Karen S. Beck, Harvard Law Library [87]rare books curator and
   manager of historical and special collections. But Harvard has some
   too, and now they are available for viewing by anyone online.

   Notebooks of great value

   Such notebooks are of great value to scholars, something Beck has
   written about for the [88]Law Library Journal. (Her [89]article also
   contains a summary of Litchfield's history and significance.)

   "They show the way people thought about the law," said Beck of the
   notebooks, "how they learned it, and how they taught it." Primary
   sources like these are especially revealing about law training in the
   early days of the United States, she said. For one, lawyers were
   struggling with how much English common law to teach, and how much
   American law.

   Central to the Litchfield story is [90]Tapping Reeve (1744-1823), the
   school's euphoniously named founder. He was a young lawyer in
   Litchfield and, like many others, he accepted clerks and apprentices
   who would perform practical chores and study from books on the side.
   After the Revolutionary War, their numbers grew so large that Reeve
   started offering formal lectures, first in his parlor and later in a
   building on his property. Litchfield became a formal school, with a law
   library, weekly examinations, and even a moot court. Its nation-scale
   curriculum drew students from every state, a geographical reach unheard
   of in that era, even among established colleges.

   Reeve was named to the Connecticut Supreme Court in 1798, so he began
   sharing teaching duties with James Gould, a former student. As the
   notebooks show, Reeve liked to veer into asides while reading his
   lectures. Gould, on the other hand, was known for reading his own
   lectures very slowly, usually twice in the 90 minutes allotted.

   Studying at Litchfield required listening to 139 such lectures, which
   commonly took 14-18 months. After each lecture, students would make
   fine copies of what they heard. A typical day, as described by one
   student, involved the morning lecture, an afternoon of copying, an
   early evening of reading the law, and a late evening of writing.

   The typical Litchfield student left with five bound notebooks of
   2,500-3,000 pages or more of fervently taken notes. (In her article,
   Beck quoted from Dante's "Divine Comedy": "He listens well who takes
   notes.") The resulting notebooks were not ephemera, she added, but
   leather-bound, encyclopedic references consulted over a lifetime of law
   practice. Because so many of the volumes were on tidy shelves and in
   practical use, many survived to find their way into libraries. Such
   notebooks are still so numerous, with many more yet to be discovered,
   that in the article Beck called her 60-page bibliography of such
   holdings "a narrow slice."

   Records indicate that the 64 bound volumes now digitized had been
   acquired over a century, dating back at least to 1859.

   A bridge in teaching law

   Litchfield was a bridge, said Beck. On one side was what had been
   typical legal training in the American colonies, the apprenticeship
   system that emphasized practical learning. On the other side are the
   formal U.S. law schools of today.

   Reeve retired in 1820 because of poor health, and Litchfield closed in
   1833. Competition had gotten intense from the law schools little
   Litchfield had inspired, such as those at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia.

   Its legacy of formalized legal instruction remains, along with an
   impressive list of more than 1,000 students. The first was Reeve's
   brother-in-law, [91]Aaron Burr Jr., who went on to be a Revolutionary
   War hero, Thomas Jefferson's vice president, and the man who killed
   Alexander Hamilton in a duel. Other graduates were reformist educator
   [92]Horace Mann, painter [93]George Catlin, and numerous senators,
   congressmen, governors, and Supreme Court justices.

   Reeve left his own legal legacy. He was the author of "The Law of Baron
   and Femme," a study of domestic law published in 1816 and reprinted in
   four editions. Some scholars say it is a proto-feminist attempt to free
   women's property from the feudal bounds of marriage.

   Reeve's work also foreshadowed an American abolitionist movement that
   would not gain national momentum for another 50 years. In 1781, he
   helped to win freedom for Elizabeth "Bett" Freeman, the first slave to
   file a "freedom suit" after slavery was theoretically outlawed by the
   1780 Massachusetts state constitution. Reeve and lawyer Theodore
   Sedgwick won the case, [94]Brom & Bett v. Ashley, and two years later
   Massachusetts declared all slaves within its borders to be free.

   The student notebooks show what Reeve thought was worth teaching:
   municipal and mercantile law, as well as the laws governing marriage,
   parenthood, guardians, property, contracts, and the power of sheriffs.
   Students also listened to lectures on "Servant and Master," which
   opened with a discussion of slavery.

   Volume 1 of Lonson Nash's student notebooks, from 1803, offers a
   contemporaneous look at what Reeve thought about slavery: three
   [95]pages of notes that contain the lecturer's opinionated asides. He
   outlines arguments on behalf of slavery, lines of reasoning that 60
   years later were still being employed. But then Reeve's voice breaks
   in: "Until there is a Charter given from Heaven to our Sea Captains,"
   the notebook entry reads, "I shall doubt their wright to separate
   father & mother brother & sister, bear them into foreign climes, there
   to linger out a miserable existance in servitude & despair."

   The same passage prefigures slavery's effect on the nations that hew to
   it, including the devastation of the Civil War: "It destroys their own
   ground."
