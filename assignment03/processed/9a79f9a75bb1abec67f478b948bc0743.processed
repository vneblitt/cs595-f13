Summary

   o 13 people, including a gunman, are dead after a shooting at the US
   navy yard in Washington DC. The city's mayor, Vincent Gray, confirmed
   the death toll at a press conference on Monday afternoon. Gray said
   there is "no known motive at this stage". He said officials "do not
   have any reason at this stage to suspect terrorism".

   o The gunman has been identified as Aaron Alexis, a 34-year-old
   military contractor. The FBI appealed for people to come forward with
   details on Alexis, who had recently been living in Fort Worth, Texas.
   "No piece of information is too small. We are looking to learn
   everything we can about his movements and his associates," said
   assistant Valerie Parlave.

   o The FBI are still hunting a potential second suspect in the shooting,
   authorities said. Authorities said they were trying to locate a man
   seen at the navy yard this morning "to determine what if any
   involvement he may have had". The man is described as a black male
   wearing an olive military-style uniform. He is between 40 and
   50-years-old, approximately 5'10" with grey sideburns, according to
   police.

   o Authorities are yet to identify any of those killed. A police officer
   was among those injured. He suffered injuries to "bones and blood
   vessels in his legs" and was in surgery on Monday afternoon, a
   spokeswoman from MedStar Washington Hospital Center said. The other two
   MedStar patients were female. One had been shot in her shoulder, the
   other in her head and hand. All were expected to survive.

   o Alexis was remembered as a "sweet" man by customers at a thai
   restaurant where he worked in Fort Worth. But police in Seattle and
   Texas said he had been arrested twice in recent years for gun
   violations. In Seattle in 2004 he shot out the tyres of a vehicle in an
   "anger-fuelled blackout" police said. He had also been arrested in
   Texas after shooting a gun through the ceiling of his apartment.

   o President Obama said the victims had faced "unimaginable violence"
   and offered his condolences to their families. "We will honour their
   service to the nation we helped to make great," Obama said. "Obviously
   we will investigate thoroughly what has happened, as we have so many of
   these shootings that has happened sadly." The president issued a
   proclamation which ordered for flags to be lowered to half-staff at all
   public buildings and military posts.

   Aaron Alexis was arrested in Seattle in 2004 for an "anger-fuelled"
   shooting, according to the Seattle police department.

   The Seattle police blog confirms that Alexis was arrested after
   shooting out the tyres of a man's vehicle.

     Following his arrest, Alexis told detectives he perceived he had
     been "mocked" by construction workers the morning of the incident
     and said they had "disrespected him." Alexis also claimed he had an
     anger-fueled "blackout," and could not remember firing his gun at
     the victims' vehicle until an hour after the incident.

     Alexis also told police he was present during "the tragic events of
     September 11, 2001'' and described "how those events had disturbed
     him."

     Detectives later spoke with Alexis' father, who lived in New York at
     the time, who told police Alexis had anger management problems
     associated with PTSD, and that Alexis had been an active participant
     in rescue attempts on September 11th, 2001.

   5.37pm ET

   Barack Obama has issued a presidential proclamation honourig the
   victims of the shooting at the Washington navy yard. The president has
   ordered for flags to be lowered to half-staff at all public buildings
   and military posts.

   Full text:

     As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of
     violence perpetrated on September 16, 2013, at the Washington Navy
     Yard, by the authority vested in me as President of the United
     States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of
     America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be
     flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings
     and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all
     naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia
     and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions
     until sunset, September 20, 2013.

     I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the
     same length of time at all United States embassies, legations,
     consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all
     military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

   5.24pm ET

   Aaron Alexis, who the FBI have identified as the gunman in the navy
   yard shooting, was a "sweet" man who never "talked about anything
   violent", according to customers of the Happy Bowl thai restaurant
   where Alexis worked in Fort Worth, Texas.

   Sandy Guerra-Cline, who works as a copy editor at the Star-Telegram
   newspaper in Fort Worth, [82]said she had been served by Alexis in his
   job waiting tables at the restaurant.

   "[Alexis was] really a sweet and intelligent guy who told us that he
   had moved to Fort Worth with the military, kind of decided to stay on
   after working at Carswell," she said.

   "He was an ex-airman. Still had that military bearing about him but
   very sweet, is not a guy that talked about guns or talked about
   anything violent. As a matter of fact my best memories of him were him
   sitting at one of the tables at Happy Bowl trying to teach himself
   Thai."

   The owner of the restaurant, Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, [83]told the
   Star-Telegram that Alexis was his "best friend".

   "He lived with me three years," Suthamtewakul said. "I don't think he'd
   do this. He has a gun, but I don't think he's that stupid. He didn't
   seem aggressive to me."

   4.36pm ET

   The US Navy has confirmed that the deceased gunman responsible for
   Monday's shooting at the Washington navy yard is a former sailor,
   Spencer Ackerman reports:

     Aaron Alexis, 34, served in the US Navy from May 2007 to January
     2011, according to Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Navy's chief of
     information.

     Alexis, whose home of record is listed as New York City, was a Navy
     aviation electrician's mate 3rd class. From February 1 2008 until
     his detachment from the Navy on January 31 2011, Alexis was assigned
     to Fleet Logistics Support Squadron (VR) 46, in Fort Worth, Texas.
     [85]Numerous media reports cited a gun-related arrest for Alexis in
     Forth Worth in 2010.

     The FBI, which is now leading the investigation, is still
     determining how Alexis got onto the Washington navy yard
     installation.

     According to a Navy document, Alexis is not listed as having served
     overseas, but is listed as receiving the National Defense Service
     Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. DC police had
     identified two other "potential suspects" early on Monday, but have
     since ruled out one of them. They continue to search for a second
     man who could be connected to the shooting.

   4.30pm ET

   "We can confirm that the deceased shooter from this morning has been
   identified as 34-year-old Aaron Alexis," said Valerie Parlave,
   assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington DC field office.

   [86]The FBI has posted pictures of Alexis on the "seeking information"
   section of its website.

   Parlave appealed for information from people who recognise Alexis. "No
   piece of information is too small. We are looking to learn everything
   we can about his movements and his associates," she said.

   An FBI team is now moving in at the navy yard "to process the scene",
   Parlave said.

   "Again, we ask the public to look at the photos of the deceased shooter
   and to contact the FBI with any information."

13 dead including gunman - DC mayor

   DC mayor Vincent Gray says 13 people are now confirmed dead following
   the shooting, including the gunman.

   The total had been 12 but a victim died at hospital, Gray said.

   The mayor confirms that one of the potential suspects has been ruled
   out: "There is no reason to continue" to think that one of the suspects
   has been involved, Gray says.

   Police are continuing to look for the second man "to determine what if
   any involvement he may have had". Gray says the second potential
   suspect was "seen in a video".

   "We don't have any reason at this stage to suspect terrorism," Gray
   says but they will work to rule it out.

   4.11pm ET

   The three injured victims being treated at MedStar Washington Hospital
   Center are all expected to make good recoveries, according to the
   hospital's chief medical officer Janis Orlowski.

   Orlowski said the male victim - who she earlier identified as a police
   officer - has "been in surgery for several hours and we expect that
   surgery to continue".

   "He is expected to make a good recovery," she said.

   Orlowski said a second victim who has a shoulder wound is also in
   surgery. She will remain in surgery for a couple of hours.

   The third victim, a woman who was shot in the head and in the hand
   "will not have surgery" Orlowski said.

   "She is a very, very, lucky young lady," she said. The bullet "did not
   penetrate the skull - that means it did not penetrate the bone,"
   Orlowski said. The victim "will recover without surgery".

   4.08pm ET

Suspect identified

   Multiple news organisations including NBC, AP, CNN, the Washington Post
   and the New York Times have identified the dead gunman as Aaron Alexis,
   34, a military contractor from Texas.

   Reports suggest Alexis was positively identified from a photo ID
   removed from his body. The next police update is due shortly.

   The US navy has issued an "order to account" for all navy uniformed
   personnel following the shootings this morning.

   The order applies to "both active duty and selected reserve, assigned
   to commands in the DC metro area. The order also applies to family
   members, navy civilian employees, as well as, NAF and NEX personnel."

   2.51pm ET

One 'potential suspect' identified, no longer person of interest

   One of the two men DC police had identified as potential suspects is no
   longer a person of interest.

   Just 30 minutes ago DC police chief Cathy Lanier said police were
   hunting two men in connection with the shooting. "We have reason to
   believe these people are involved and we need to talk to them," she
   told reporters.

   It now appears that police have been able to rule one of the men out of
   their enquiries:

     The white male in the tan outfit has been identified and is not a
     suspect or person of interest.

   Secretary of defense Chuck Hagel has issued a statement in response to
   the shootings.

     I have been receiving regular updates on the shooting at the
     Washington Navy Yard, and continue to monitor the situation closely.
     This is a tragic day for the Department of Defense, the national
     capital area, and the nation.

     My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this outrageous act
     of violence, their families, and all those affected by today's
     events. I am grateful for the swift response of federal and local
     law enforcement, and for the professionalism of DoD personnel at the
     Navy Yard complex.

     The Department of Defense will continue to offer its full assistance
     in the investigation of this terrible and senseless violence.

   DC police chief Cathy Lanier confirmed that there are "at least 12
   fatalities".

   Lanier reiterated that police are looking for two more potential
   suspects.

   "Right now we have multiple pieces of information that would suggest we
   have at least two other individuals that were seen with firearms," she
   said.

   "These are people that we really believe are involved in some way."

   Asked why police believe there are two additional gunmen, Lanier
   repeated: "We have reason to believe these people are involved and we
   need to talk to them."

   Lanier said there were "a few additional folks who were injured"
   besides the 12 dead. "They were not fatally injured," she said of the
   other victims.

   More than one police officer has been injured, Lanier said, but "only
   one was injured by gunfire". She did not specify the nature of the
   other injuries to police.

   Lanier repeated that police are looking for information on two men. One
   is a white male "between 40 and 50" wearing a tan military-style
   uniform consistent with navy uniform", she said.

   "We also have a lookout" for a black male in an olive military-style
   uniform, Lanier said. That man is approximately 5'10" with grey
   sideburns, she said.

   2.08pm ET

12 dead in navy yard shooting

   DC Mayor Vincent Gray says there are "at least 12 fatalities".

   There is "no known motive at this stage", he says. "We also don't know
   if there were other" gunmen, he said.

   1.49pm ET

   The "shelter-in-place" at the Washington Navy Yard - the order for
   employees to stay where they are - is still in effect four hours after
   today's mass shooting began, my colleague Spencer Ackerman reports:

     A navy official confirmed that sailors and civilians assigned to the
     Washington navy yard, as well as all personnel assigned to the
     nearby Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, are advised to stay put while
     authorities continue to investigate the scene.

      Police are still searching Building 197 at the navy yard, the site
     of today's violence, which has left several people dead and others
     injured.

   1.18pm ET

Summary

   o One gunman is dead after a number of people were shot at the US navy
   yard on Monday morning, police said. DC police chief Cathy Lanier said
   a suspect was deceased, but details remain unclear. Lanier told reports
   that police "potentially have two other shooters that we have not
   located at this point".

   o The two other potential suspects are both male and were wearing
   military-style clothing, Lanier said. One of the men was white and was
   last seen at "around 8.35am this morning with a handgun," she said. The
   second man was black, around 50-years-old, and was carrying a rifle.
   Police are appealing for information on the men.

   o "Multiple victims" were killed in the shooting, Lanier said. She did
   not give exact numbers of the dead. Three victims were taken to MedStar
   Washington Hospital Center, were all three were in a critical
   condition, the hospital's chief medical officer Janis Orlowski said.
   The three were expected to survive.

   o A police officer is among those injured, with multiple gunshot wounds
   to his legs, Orlowski said. She said the man had injuries to "bones and
   blood vessels in his legs". The other two MedStar patients were female.
   One had been shot in her shoulder, the other in her head and hand.

   o Eye-witnesses recalled how a gunman had fired at them in the Naval
   Sea Systems Command Headquarters building. One man, who was not named,
   told CNN that as he and his colleagues left the building "we noticed
   him down the hall". The witness added: "As he came round the corner he
   aimed his gun at us and he fired at least two or three shots."

   o President Obama said the victims had faced "unimaginable violence"
   and offered his condolences to their families. "We will honour their
   service to the nation we helped to make great," Obama said. "Obviously
   we will investigate thoroughly what has happened, as we have so many of
   these shootings that has happened sadly."

   o Security has been increased at the Pentagon as a "proactive,
   precautionary measure". Department of defense spokesman George Little
   described the shooting as "a fluid situation". He said navy officials
   are working with law enforcement and the FBI "to secure the scene and
   begin the investigation".

   More from George Little:

     Not out of a specific threat, but as a prudent and precautionary
     step, we have increased our security posture at the Pentagon.
     -- George Little (@PentagonPresSec) [98]September 16, 2013

   12.40pm ET

   Department of defense press secretary George Little has issued this
   statement:

     Everyone here at the Department of Defense is saddened by the
     incident at the Washington Navy Yard this morning. Our thoughts and
     prayers are with the victims. Secretary Hagel is closely following
     the situation and has assured the Navy we will provide any resource
     or capability needed to get the Washington Navy Yard community
     through this event.

     The commander of the Military District of Washington is determining
     the operational and security status of military installations in the
     National Capital Region. Individual installation commanders have the
     authority to change their operating status at their discretion.
     While the Pentagon remains open, the Pentagon Force Protection
     Agency increased its security posture, not out of a specific threat,
     but as a proactive, precautionary measure.

     This is a fluid situation. Navy officials are working closely with
     law enforcement and emergency management representatives from the
     FBI and the District of Columbia to secure the scene and begin the
     investigation. More information will be released from the
     appropriate agency as it becomes available.

   President Obama has offered his condolences to the families of the
   shooting victims.

     I've been briefed by my team on the situation. We still don't know
     all the facts, but we do know that several people have been shot and
     some people have been killed.

   "It's a shooting that targeted our military and civilian personnel.
   These are men and women [...] doing their job and going to work.
   They're patriots."

   He added: "Today they faced unimaginable violence that they wouldn't
   have expected here at home."

   "I've made it clear to my team that I want the investigation to be
   seamless," the president said, with federal and local teams working
   together.

   "We thank them for their service. We stand by the families of those who
   have been harmed," Obama said.

   "We will honour their service to the nation we helped to make great.
   Obviously we will investigate thoroughly what has happened, as we have
   so many of these shootings that has happened sadly."

   12.30pm ET

   "This investigation is still very active," Washington DC police chief
   Cathy Lanier said in a press conference.

   "We potentially have two other shooters that we have not located at
   this point."

   Lanier confirmed that one shooter was deceased. She added that
   "multiple victims" had been killed - but would not give a number of the
   deceased.

   In a signal of the chaotic scene, Lanier said it was "not confirmed"
   that there were two other shooters.

   She said one of the men police were looking for was a "white male in
   military fatigues".

   "He was last seen around 8.35am this morning with a handgun," she said.

   "We also have a lookout for potentially another shooter who was
   involved," Lanier said. She described the second man as black and
   wearing a military-style fatigues.

   "We do have information that those individuals are wearing
   military-style uniforms," she said.

   Lanier urged anyone with information on the two men to call the police.

   She said police received the first call with information on the
   shooting shortly after 8.15am. A police team was deployed "within 7
   minutes of the first call coming in," Lanier said.

   12.21pm ET

Incident involved up to three gunmen

   The Washington DC police chief, Cathy Lanier, says the incident may
   have involved up to three gunmen. She confirms that one is dead, and
   police are searching for two others. "We potentially have two shooters
   out there," she said.

   "We have one shooter that we believe is involved in this who is
   deceased," she said. "We have multiple victims inside who are
   deceased," Lanier added. She would not give numbers of the dead.

   Washington DC's mayor, Vincent Gray, says "we're still trying to
   confirm the number of fatalities".

   An update from Paul Lewis, on the scene in DC:

     Gwen Crump, a spokesman for Washington DC Metropolitan Police
     Department, says the police chief Cathy L Lanier giving a press
     conference around 12.05pm, outside the Navy Yard.
     She will be joined by the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. She dismissed
     rumours of a second shooting at Bolling Air Force Base.

   The US Navy has [99]an updated statement on the shooting with
   information for those whose family may have been involved in the
   incident.

     Washington D.C. Metro Police Deptartment advises family members of
     Washington Navy Yard employees may meet their loved ones at
     Nationals Stadium. [Specifically] Lot B, South Capitol & N St SE

     Family members looking for information about their loved ones can

     Several people were injured and there are reports of fatalities in a
     shooting at the Washington Navy Yard September 16.

   11.48am ET

   Three people are in a critical condition at MedStar Washington Hospital
   Center, according to the hospital's chief medical officer Janis
   Orlowski.

   In a press conference just now Orlowski confirmed there were fatalities
   at the scene but did not say how many people had been killed. She said
   the three victims at MedStar are "alert and responsive".

   "They are able to talk to us. They do have severe injuries but we have
   been able to speak with all of them," she said.

   "Obviously they are in pain and in distress because of what they
   suffered this morning," Orlowski added.

   "One metropolitan police officer is here, the other two are civilians,"
   she said. "We understand there is potentially another metropolitan
   police officer at the scene, but we have no confirmation of that."

   Orlowski said all three were in a critical condition. The police
   officer, a male, has "multiple gunshot wounds to his legs", she said,
   with injuries to "bones and blood vessels in his legs".

   The other two injured people are both women, Orlowski said. One has a
   wound to the shoulder, the other has injuries to her hand and head.

   "Their chances for survival are very good," Orlowski said.

   She said she did not know yet if any more injured people would be
   coming to the MedStar hospital but confirmed people had been killed at
   the navy yard.

   "We understand there are individuals at the scene who will not be
   transported [to the hospital] because they are deceased."

   Orlowski said medical staff believe the three patients were shot with a
   semi-automatic rifle.

   My colleague Paul Lewis has spoken to an eyewitness at the navy yard in
   DC:

   Patricia Ward, 53, a logistics specialist at the Navy, said she was in
   the canteen when the shooting took place on the fourth floor.

   "I heard the first three shots: 'Pow pow pow'. A few seconds later:
   'Pop pop pop' - four more shots. And then everyone in the cafeteria
   just started running. We panicked as we didn't know which door to use.
   One lady said stay in the cafeteria but I just said no. We didn't
   scream, we were just in shocking, running, running."

   Ward ran out of the building an right blocks down M Street. "People
   were just flying out of the office. There was probably twenty or thirty
   people just running."

'We believe there has been loss of life' â Pentagon

   Spencer Ackerman, Guardian US national security editor, sends this
   update from the Pentagon:

     "We believe there has been loss of life and several injuries," said
     Pentagon press secretary George Little to reporters. Little had no
     information about any arrests made at the Washington Navy Yard.

     Little said Secretary Chuck Hagel was receiving "regular updates"
     about the "ongoing" shooter situation at Building 197 in the
     Washington Navy Yard in southeast Washington. One was ongoing at
     10.30am.

     Little did not identify any of the casualties or specify of they are
     sailor or civilian. Nor did he say he knew if one or multiple
     shooters took part in the deadly situation. It is also unknown as
     yet what weapons the shooter or shooters used.

     Little would not speculate on any motive for the assault, citing the
     fluid situation.

     Army Col Steve Warren, another Pentagon spokesman, said he expected
     "all regional military facilities" to take "prudent steps" to secure
     their installations, but there are no reports as yet of an attack
     elsewhere. Nor have regional bases been put on lockdown.

     Security at the Pentagon this morning did not appear different from
     any other day.

   Updated at 12.56pm ET

   10.59am ET

   The Guardian's DC correspondent Paul Lewis is on the scene at the US
   navy yard:

   10.58am ET

   CNN has just interviewed two eye witnesses who said a gunman fired
   towards them this morning in the US navy yard.

   One of the witnesses, who CNN did not name, said a man had fired at a
   group of people.

   "The fire alarm went off first... I was on the phone and someone came
   over and said hey this is not a fire alarm, someone has been shot in
   the building," the man said.

     As we were exiting the backdoor we noticed him down the hall. He
     stepped around the corner and we heard shots. As he came round the
     corner he aimed his gun at us and he fired at least two or three
     shots.

   "There was a group of us. He aimed the gun and fired our way," the man
   said.

   Updated at 11.01am ET

   10.27am ET

   The Guardian's Washington correspondent Paul Lewis has more information
   on the site of the shooting:

     The Navy Yard is a secure military facility and it would be unusual
     for a non-staff member without credentials to be permitted onto the
     site.

     Clearance and security ID are typically required to access the base.

     Many of the streets surrounding the Yard, which is the south-west of
     the city, beside the Anacostia River, is in lockdown.

     Helicopters were hovering above the scene and there was a huge
     police presence near the Yard, a complex of several buildings near
     the Nationals baseball stadium, around a mile from Capitol Hill.

     Flights from Reagan Airport, located across the river, have been
     temporarily suspended.

   "An active shooter was reported inside the Naval Sea Systems Command

   The navy said that employees at the scene had been ordered to "shelter
   in place". The statement on its website was last updated at 9.42am.

   has been taken to MedStar Washington Hospital Center.

   9.57am ET

   At least three people, including a police officer, have been shot at
   the US navy yard in Washington DC, police said on Monday morning.

   The suspected gunman remains at large within the navy yard, where
   police and emergency crews are gathered.

   Local news websites have quoted police as saying the suspect is
   barricaded somewhere within the navy yard with "multiple guns".

   Local [119]news channel WUSA9, citing a police spokesman, reported that
   "four people and one officer" had been shot at the navy yard. The
   [120]Washington Post also reported that an officer was among those
   shot. Reuters reported four injuries, citing a police spokesman.

   WUSA9 said: "He is believed to be barricaded somewhere and have
   multiple guns," the channel added.

   The shootings took place near to the naval sea systems command
   headquarters, Associated Press reported. About 3,000 people work in the
   building. Employees inside the building have been directed to stay in
   place.
