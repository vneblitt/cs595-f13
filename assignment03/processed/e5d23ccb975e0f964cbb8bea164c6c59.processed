   People get jobs in the federal government in the same way that they get
   most jobs in the private industry: by finding job openings and
   submitting a resume or job application. You can research and apply for
   government jobs online with a resume. However, while the process is now
   very similar to that in private industry, there are still significant
   differences due to the many laws, executive orders, and regulations
   that govern federal and state employment.

   [76]USAJOBS.gov can help you find out how federal jobs are filled;
   learn more about the hiring reform; find tips for your resume,
   application, and interview; and how to apply for federal jobs. Most
   federal jobs are listed on USAJOBS; however, some excepted service
   agencies post jobs independently on their own website or elsewhere. If
   you'd like to work for a specific agency, do a targeted search of their
   job sections and employment information pages.

Federal Government Jobs

     * [77]USAJOBS.gov: Official Federal Job Site
       USAJOBS is the official job site for the U.S. federal government,
       and is operated by the [78]U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
       Most federal civilian jobs--with the exception of jobs in the
       [79]federal judiciary--are posted on USAJOBS.
     * [80]Search for Jobs
       The federal government has thousands of job openings at any given
       time. Use Advanced Search to narrow your search by job title,
       agency, location, and other criteria.
     * [81]Apply for Jobs
       Each vacancy announcement has unique application requirements. If
       you've determined that you qualify for a position, review the "How
       to Apply" section of the job announcement. Some positions seek
       electronic applications while others accept applications by mail.
     * [82]Citizenship
       U.S. citizenship is required for most federal jobs. Some agencies
       hire non-citizens through special hiring procedures. [83]Contact
       agencies directly to inquire about positions for non-citizens.
     * [84]Security Clearance
       Some jobs with the federal government require a security clearance;
       however, the government will not request or pay for a background
       investigation until you are offered a position that requires a
       clearance.
     * [85]FAQs, Tutorials, and Other Help
       Find answers to questions about the federal pay scale, the meaning
       of terms like "series," "grade," "status candidate," and more.

State Job Banks

     * [86]State Job Banks
       Search the state job banks on CareerOneStop, a U.S. Department of
       Labor-sponsored site for job seekers.
