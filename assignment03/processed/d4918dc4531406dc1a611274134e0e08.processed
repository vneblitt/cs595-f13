   11 September 2013 - More people than ever are living abroad the United
   Nations today reported, with Asia seeing the largest increase of
   international migrants over the past decade, and the United States
   remaining the most popular destination.

   New figures from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs
   (UN-DESA) show that 232 million people, or 3.2 per cent of the world's
   population, live abroad worldwide, compared with 175 million in 2000
   and 154 million in 1990.

   In addition, the figures also show a shift since 2000 with South-North
   and South-South migration at about 82 million international migrants.

   "Most international migrants originate in developing country but in
   recent years they have been settling in almost equal number in
   developed and developing regions," John Wilmoth, Director of UN-DESA's
   Population Division told journalists in New York. He spoke alongside
   Bela Hovy, Chief of the Migration Section.

   The figures are released ahead of a high-level global summit on
   migration and development to be held by the General Assembly in New
   York on 3 and 4 October.

   This second high-level dialogue will aim to identifying concrete
   measures to strengthen coherence and cooperation at all levels, with a
   view to enhancing the benefits of international migration for migrants
   and countries alike and its important link to development, while
   reducing its negative impacts.

   "Migration, when governed fairly, can make a very important
   contribution to social and economic development both in the countries
   of origin and in the countries of destination," said Wu Hongbo, UN
   Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs.

   "Migration broadens the opportunities available to individuals and is a
   crucial means of broadening access to resources and reducing poverty."

   According to the latest statistics, Europe and Asia host nearly
   two-thirds of all international migrants worldwide. Europe remains the
   most popular destination region with 72 million international migrants
   in 2013, compared to 71 million in Asia.

   Within Europe, Germany and France hosts the largest immigrant
   communities due to work migration and geographic routes with North
   Africa.

   "New sources and destinations of migrants are emerging, and in some
   cases, countries have become important points of origin, transit and
   destination simultaneously," Mr. Wilmoth said.

   Compared to other regions of destination, Asia saw the largest increase
   of international migrants since 2000, adding some 20 million migrants
   in 13 years.

   This growth was mainly fuelled by the increasing demand for foreign
   labour in the oil-producing countries of Western Asia and in
   South-Eastern Asian countries with rapidly growing economies, such as
   Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.

   The world's largest corridor of international migration, however,
   remains between the United States and Mexico, according to the latest
   figures.

   The US gained the largest absolute number of international migrants
   between 1990 and 2013--nearly 23 million, equal to one million
   additional migrants per year.

   The United Arab Emirates recorded the second largest gain with seven
   million, followed by Spain with six million.

   The findings also show that 74 per cent of international migrants are
   of working age, between 20 and 64 years of age, and that are about
   evenly spread between genders, with women accounting for 48 per cent of
   all international migrants.
