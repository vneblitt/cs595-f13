   'That's So Raven' Star
   Sentenced to 180 Days in Jail
   Exclusive
   0906-orlando-brown-tmz
   It just keeps getting worse ... "That's So Raven" star Orlando Brown is
   behind bars, 2 weeks into a 180-day sentence ... in one of the
   craziest, most drawn-out DUI cases we've ever seen.
   Law enforcement sources tell us, Brown was remanded into custody on
   August 23 following a hearing ... where he failed to show proof he
   completed court-ordered alcohol ed classes for his 2011 DUI arrest.
   The only good news for Brown is L.A. County jails are way overcrowded
   -- so, he's expected to be released after only 27 days ... on September
   19.
   Brown's been crazy lucky until now -- in the last year 4 bench warrants
   were issued for his arrest, after he repeatedly failed to follow
   various court orders.
