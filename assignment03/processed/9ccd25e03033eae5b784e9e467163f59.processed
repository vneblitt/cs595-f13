Experts help develop Trees for Energy Conservation online resource

   A home surrounded by large trees Properly planted trees can reduce
   heating and cooling costs.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., June 14, 2013 - Planting a tree can save energy. The
   right tree in the right place provides wind protection, shade, and
   cooler summer air, while adding beauty, privacy, and wildlife habitat
   to the landscape.

   Two experts affiliated with the [160]College of Natural Resources and
   Environment are involved in a new online resource, [161]Trees for
   Energy Conservation, to help consumers and professionals make decisions
   about selecting, planting, and maintaining trees for energy
   conservation.

   [162]Eric Wiseman, associate professor of urban forestry and
   arboriculture, and [163]Adam Downing, senior forestry and natural
   resources Virginia Cooperative Extension agent, were involved in
   developing the interactive site, which includes guided lessons,
   opportunities to question experts, and links to articles on such
   diverse topics as planting trees for noise reduction, the urban heat
   island phenomenon, and tips for renters. Wiseman and Downing have
   contributed many articles and other information on the website.

   "The website provides answers for everyday questions that come from
   individuals, tree care professionals, business owners, community
   leaders, and others," Wiseman said. "Experts from across the country
   contribute to the site on topics running the gamut from tree selection
   and pruning to the role of trees in bioremediation and the difference
   between an arborist and a landscaper."

   According to the U.S. Department of Energy, carefully positioned trees
   can save up to 25 percent of a household's energy consumption for
   heating and cooling. Deciduous trees save energy in summer by shading
   houses, paved areas, and air conditioners. Evergreens also save energy
   by slowing cold winds in the winter. Both deciduous and evergreen trees
   save energy in summer by directly cooling the air as water evaporates
   from leaf surfaces.

   The Trees for Energy Conservation website is hosted by [164]eXtension,
   a national research and education based website supported by the
   Cooperative Extension System in partnership with 75 land-grant
   universities. Southern Regional Extension Forester Bill Hubbard
   initiated development of Extension's first urban forestry Community of
   Practice and the Trees for Conservation site in 2012, working with
   experts from all regions of the country under a grant from the U.S.
   Forest Service.

   "Our goal is to be a useful and adaptable resource for everyone
   interested in how trees can help save energy," said Downing. "We know
   businesses, educators, homeowners, environmentalists, and others are
   interested in conserving energy in general. Trees are one of the most
   cost-effective tools in the box and simultaneously provide many other
   benefits."

   The [165]College of Natural Resources and Environment at Virginia Tech,
   which consistently ranks among the top three programs of its kind in
   the nation, advances the science of sustainability. Programs prepare
   the future generation of leaders to address the complex natural
   resources issues facing the planet. World-class faculty lead
   transformational research that complements the student learning
   experience and impacts citizens and communities across the globe on
   sustainability issues, especially as they pertain to water, climate,
   fisheries, wildlife, forestry, sustainable biomaterials, ecosystems,
   and geography. As a land-grant university, Virginia Tech serves the
   Commonwealth of Virginia in teaching, research, and [166]Virginia
   Cooperative Extension.
