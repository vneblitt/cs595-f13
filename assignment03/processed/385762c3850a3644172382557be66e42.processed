Get the Resources You Need to Find a Job

   Looking for a job takes time, dedication, and hard work, but you can
   ease the process by getting organized and finding the right help.

   [56]CareerOneStop is a website created by the Department of Labor to
   help you prepare for your job search, access job searching tools, and
   find [57]local career centers where you can get personalized help on
   everything from writing resumes to interviewing for a job.

   CareerOneStop can help you:

   1. Explore careers. Learn more about yourself through self-assessment
   tests and browse different types of occupations.

   2. Determine wages and salaries. Compare wages and salaries for
   specific positions, use cost-of-living calculators and find the highest
   paying jobs by location.

   3. Create a resume. Get assistance in creating one of the most
   important documents you will need for your job search: a résumé. Find
   tips on how to improve your résumé, sample résumés, and information on
   how to write a cover letter.

   4. Look for jobs. Use CareerOneStop's tool to [58]find jobs across the
   country. You will learn who's hiring, and where and when the job was
   posted. [59]USAJOBS is also a good tool to find jobs with the federal
   government, but keep in mind that many of these jobs require applicants
   to be U.S. citizens and speak English.

   5. Prepare for a job interview. Get tips with how to get and prepare
   for job interviews, including setting one up, finding people and making
   contacts.

Training and Development

   Besides helping you prepare for your job search, CareerOneStop also has
   information to help you get the [60]education and training you need,
   and find ways to pay for it:
     * Short-term training designed to further your skills for specific
       professions.
     * Technical certifications on a wide range of jobs including medical
       assistants, automotive technicians, electricians, etc.
     * Financial aid and scholarships to help you finance loans and grants
       if you choose to pursue higher education.
