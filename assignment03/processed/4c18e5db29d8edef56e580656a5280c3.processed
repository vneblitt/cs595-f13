D.C.âs height limits: The risk of ending them

   Written by [300]Philip Kennicott
   Philip Kennicott

   From the beginning, Washington was not quite a real city, more of an
   idea and an ideal laid out on the marshy lowlands of the Potomac River.
   Other cities -- Chicago and New York -- grew fast, and tall, with a
   nervous eye on the competition and an obsession with the record books.
   Washington was different, a city based on a European plan, an ambitious
   framework of avenues that were too wide and roads that were too many,
   so that the city always seemed a little empty, unfinished, struggling
   to fill in its vast empty spaces. It looked like a kid in an oversize
   Sunday suit, never tall enough for its trousers, with a jacket hanging
   loose and long on a frame that was the opposite of Chicago's City of
   the Big Shoulders.

   IFRAME:

   -heights-study/?template=iframe

   That has changed. Washington reversed a decades-long decline in
   population, and has for several years been growing as fast as any of
   the fastest-growing states. Long-neglected neighborhoods have been
   gentrified, real estate prices are skyrocketing, and the Office of
   Planning predicts that we could run out of attractive places for
   developers to build. We think of ourselves -- finally -- as a real
   city, full of amenities and rich in culture, where the streets are no
   longer rolled up snugly at 10 p.m.

   All of that has made the current conversation about raising the
   District's height limits, codified in federal law more than a century
   ago, different from past efforts. Today, with an influential Republican
   congressman willing to help amend the law, the city's technocratic
   elites anxious to be free of its blanket proscription on building tall,
   and developers investing as never before, there is a real possibility
   that the height limits could be rescinded.

   That would put control over height in the District's hands and, after
   amending the city plan and zoning laws, there probably would be
   targeted increases downtown that wouldn't affect views of the major
   monuments and federal landmarks, and possibly high-rise development
   near Metro stops away from the city center.

   The city, concerned about the controversy raised by any discussion of
   the height limits, has stressed that amending the law doesn't
   necessarily mean raising the limits, and that any increases would be
   sensitive to the horizontal character of the District. Working with the
   National Capital Planning Commission, the city is holding public
   meetings, researching the impact, and will make recommendations to
   Congress this fall.

   The problem is, we remain a city troubled by corruption, with three
   councilmen in two years pleading guilty to crimes that included fraud
   and embezzlement. Our mayor is under investigation for possible illegal
   activities during his 2010 campaign. A former mayor who was sent to
   jail, then reelected still serves on the city council. Politically we
   tend to learn the true character of too many politicians only after
   they have criminally abused their office. Rescinding the height limits
   could test the city's ability to manage its development, enabling new
   forms of corruption. This could lead to radical changes in the urban
   fabric driven by politicians and developers seeking profits, tax
   revenue and personal gain.

   So the question isn't just about urban design, it's about politics and
   collective maturity: Have we grown up enough to grow up?

   The views along 19th Street NW, looking north from Dupong Circle, model
   heights as related to street width. The current view shows buildings
   along the 110-food-wide street rising to the zoning limit of 90 feet,
   less than a 1-to-1 ratio. The views along 19th Street NW, looking north
   from Dupong Circle, model heights as related to street width. The
   current view shows buildings along the 110-food-wide street rising to
   the zoning limit of 90 feet, less than a 1-to-1 ratio.

   Almost from the city's birth, height has been a central concern. In
   1791, George Washington established not only an upper limit but also a
   lower minimum: "The wall of no house to be higher than forty feet to
   the roof, in any part of the city; nor shall any be lower than
   thirty-five feet on any of the avenues."

   The goal was a streetscape as grand as the avenues were wide, but that
   proved too much to hope for in a city that felt more like a provisional
   encampment than a national capital. Washington's ordinance was
   suspended in 1796, 1801 and 1803. As historian Witold Rybczynski
   explained in a 2008 lecture at the National Building Museum:
   "Washington wasn't filling in."

   Even so, for most of the 19th century, only a few federal buildings
   rose above the general low level of the city. It was the 1894
   construction of the 12-story Cairo Building, near Dupont Circle, that
   led to the height limits as we know them. Shocked by the 164-foot-tall
   apartment building, District residents sought to curb any race to the
   sky.

   After iterations in 1894 and 1899, Congress passed the 1910 Height of
   Buildings Act, which said the height would be proportionate to the
   width of the street, plus, in some cases, an extra 20 feet. Thus
   buildings can rise no more than 90 feet on residential streets, 130
   feet on commercial streets, and 160 on a small section of Pennsylvania
   Avenue. Government buildings and ornamental features (towers, spires
   and other architectural gewgaws) were excepted.

   The District's law was based on what other cities were doing and was
   motivated as much by safety concerns as by aesthetics (fire was the
   paramount worry). In 1900, London drew the line at 80; Chicago at 130;
   and St. Louis at 150. New York and Philadelphia had no limits.
