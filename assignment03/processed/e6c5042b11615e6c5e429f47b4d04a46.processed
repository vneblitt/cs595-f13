BEST FILM FESTIVAL EVER?

   image

   I just got back from the Traverse City Film Festival in Northern
   Michigan.  It's amazing.  Having attended a pretty wide range of
   festivals, including some of those "prestigious" international
   festivals, this is the one that really made me appreciate movies
   (including my own) again.  How did this happen?

   It's a weird festival in a lot of ways - it takes place in a small
   tourist town on Lake Michigan, one of those summer towns I've only read
   about or seen in movies, but never visited.  On the surface, it seems
   more appropriate for a big Fourth of July celebration or something, not
   an international film festival.  Traverse City is pure
   Americana...there's a Main Street USA (Front Street) with a beautiful
   100 year old single-screen theater, several bookstores (as in more than
   one, seriously!), there are stores selling fudge, ice cream, kettle
   corn, and the famous local cherry-jams and the city is, by my estimate,
   about 99.9% white (I might have been the entire .1%).

   The founder is Michael Moore, and at some point over nine years ago, he
   decided to bring indie films, foreign films, and some pretty hard-core
   documentaries to this small town in middle America.  But instead of
   just using Traverse City as the backdrop for the festival, he decided
   to make it part of the town..really getting the community involved and
   making it "their" festival as well.  As a result, the festival is run
   (very effectively) by almost entirely local volunteers.  Only two or
   three of the staff is full-time and paid.  And they're way better at
   their jobs than most festival staff.  Also, they don't accept film
   submissions.  Michael and a few of his programmers hand-pick movies
   from other festivals, or get recommendations.

   I don't think I've ever felt as appreciated as a filmmaker or maybe
   even as a human being.  Michael made a short but moving speech at the
   filmmaker lunch about cinema being the most popular art form and how
   important it is to him that filmmakers are treated with that respect
   (as artists) at this festival.  They really backed it up:

   Every single screening is packed (even theaters with 800 seat
   capacities), and the sound and projection are by far the best that I've
   had so far on this festival/theatrical run.  There's a theater manager
   at every screening that literally sits with you once the movie starts
   until you've told him if the sound and projection quality is okay with
   you.  Somehow they managed to have other (much better) filmmakers come
   and moderate the panels and Q&A's, so they're really leading
   discussions about filmmaking. They put the name of the movie up on the
   marquee for every screening.  They have a filmmaker lounge constantly
   stocked with food and refreshments donated by local restaurants.  You
   can get tickets to any screening just by asking (I've never seen so
   many other movies at a festival ever).  The people in Traverse City are
   so nice they will stop you on the street and compliment you about your
   movie and thank you earnestly for coming to the festival, so nice that
   when you're crossing the street, they'll roll down their car windows
   and yell "I loved your movie."  I played with the festival volunteers
   in a fucking kickball game!

   I've definitely already doused myself in the Kool Aid.  I left Traverse
   City hoping that I would make another movie soon only so I might have
   another chance to go back to Traverse City.
