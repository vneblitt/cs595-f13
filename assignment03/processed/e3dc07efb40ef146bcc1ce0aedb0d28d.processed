   Rock nâ Roll Hall of Famers Jeff Beck and Brian Wilson will headline
   the 7th annual School Rocks benefit concert October 29 at the House of
   Blues.

   The Beck-Wilson band will include Beach Boys AL Jardine and David
   Marks. D.J. A.T. will open.

   The benefit is the only Chicago stop for the Beck-Wilson fall tour that
   begins Sept. 27 in Hollywood, Fla. Each artist is slated to perform
   separate sets, but also sit in with each other.

   Expect hearts full of soul-and sun.

   Tickets for the School Rocks benefit concert are $300 and available at
   [81]San Miguel Rocks or by calling (773) 890-0233. All proceeds
   Â provide scholarships and community support to inner-city students at
   San Miguel School Chicago.

   Since 2007, the School Rocks benefit concerts have raised $2.5 million
   for student scholarships. Past headliners have included REO Speedwagon,
   Styx and Joey Molland of Badfinger.

   San Miguelâs mission is transforming lives through education,
   commitment, and love. 97% of San Miguel students are at or below the
   U.S. poverty rate, but the high school graduation rate for San Miguel
   alumni is 92% (national rate is 75% and CPS is 63%).

   School Rocks Celebrity co-chairs include Larry Wert,
   President/Broadcast Media of the Tribune Company, Howard Tullman,
   Chairman/Tribeca Flashpoint Media Arts Academy, Chicago rock legends JY
   Young of Styx , Bun E. Carlos of Cheap Trick and Jim Peterik of the
   Ides of March and Survivor.

   Hmn. Wonder who might also Â sit in?

   During the evening, San Miguel will present its Leadership in Education
   award. Past recipients include U. S. Secretary of Education Arne
   Duncan, Kathleen and John Buck, Mike and Pat Koldyke, Bill Engels, and
   Mrs. Lina Abraham.

   San Miguel School Chicago provides an innovative and accessible
   educational experience for children from inner-city families, so that
   they can complete high school with the skills, support and
   self-awareness to make the next productive choice in life.
