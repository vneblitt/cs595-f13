   WASHINGTON -- The deadly attack at the Washington Navy Yard was carried
   out by one of the military's own: a defense contract employee and
   former Navy reservist who used a valid pass to get onto the
   installation and started firing inside a building, killing 12 people
   before he was slain in a gun battle with police.

   The motive for the mass shooting -- the deadliest on a military
   installation in the U.S. since the tragedy at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009
   -- was a mystery, investigators said. But a profile of the lone gunman,
   a 34-year-old Aaron Alexis, was coming into focus. He was described as
   a Buddhist who had had flares of rage, complained about the Navy and
   being a victim of discrimination and had several run-ins with law
   enforcement, including two shootings.

   Monday's onslaught at a single building at the highly secure Navy Yard
   unfolded about 8:20 a.m. in the heart of the nation's capital, less
   than four miles from the White House and two miles from the Capitol.

   It put all of Washington on edge. Mayor Vincent Gray said there was no
   indication it was a terrorist attack, but he added that the possibility
   had not been ruled out.

   "This is a horrific tragedy," he said.

   Alexis carried three weapons: an AR-15 assault rifle, a shotgun and a
   handgun that he took from a police officer at the scene, according to
   two federal law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of
   anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the
   investigation.

   For much of the day, authorities said they were looking for a possible
   second attacker who may have been disguised in an olive-drab
   military-style uniform. But by late Monday night, they said they were
   convinced the shooting was the work of a lone gunman, and the lockdown
   around the area was eased.

   "We do now feel comfortable that we have the single and sole person
   responsible for the loss of life inside the base today," Washington
   Police Chief Cathy Lanier said.

   President Barack Obama lamented yet another mass shooting in the U.S.
   that he said took the lives of American "patriots." He promised to make
   sure "whoever carried out this cowardly act is held responsible."

   The FBI took charge of the investigation.

   The attack came four years after Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan
   killed 13 people at Fort Hood in what he said was an effort to save the
   lives of Muslims overseas. He was convicted last month and sentenced to
   death.

   In addition to those killed at the Navy Yard, eight people were hurt,
   including three who were shot and wounded, according to the mayor.
   Those three were a police officer and two female civilians, authorities
   said. They were all expected to survive.

   The dead ranged in age from 46 to 73, according to the mayor. A number
   of the victims were civilian employees and contractors, rather than
   active-duty military personnel, the police chief said.

   At the time of the rampage, Alexis was an employee with The Experts, a
   company that was a Defense Department subcontractor on a Navy-Marine
   Corps computer project, authorities said.

   Valerie Parlave, head of the FBI's field office in Washington, said
   Alexis had access to the Navy Yard as a defense contractor and used a
   valid pass.

   Alexis had been a full-time Navy reservist from 2007 to early 2011,
   leaving as a petty officer third class, the Navy said. It did not say
   why he left. He had been an aviation electrician's mate with a unit in
   Fort Worth.

   A convert to Buddhism who grew up in New York City, Alexis had had
   run-ins with the law over shooting incidents in 2004 and 2010 in Fort
   Worth and Seattle and was portrayed in police reports as seething with
   anger.

   The Washington Navy Yard is a sprawling, 41-acre labyrinth of buildings
   and streets protected by armed guards and metal detectors, and
   employees have to show their IDs at doors and gates. More than 18,000
   people work there.

   The rampage took place at Building 197, the headquarters for Naval Sea
   Systems Command, which buys, builds and maintains ships and submarines.
   About 3,000 people work at headquarters, many of them civilians.

   Witnesses on Monday described a gunman opening fire from a fourth-floor
   overlook, aiming down on people on the main floor, which includes a
   glass-walled cafeteria. Others said a gunman fired at them in a
   third-floor hallway.

   Patricia Ward, a logistics-management specialist, said she was in the
   cafeteria getting breakfast.

   "It was three gunshots straight in a row -- pop, pop, pop. Three
   seconds later, it was pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, so it was like about a
   total of seven gunshots, and we just started running," Ward said.

   Todd Brundidge, an executive assistant with Navy Sea Systems Command,
   said he and co-workers encountered a gunman in a long hallway on the
   third floor. The gunman was wearing all blue, he said.

   "He just turned and started firing," Brundidge said.

   Terrie Durham, an executive assistant with the same agency, said the
   gunman fired toward her and Brundidge.

   "He aimed high and missed," she said. "He said nothing. As soon as I
   realized he was shooting, we just said, `Get out of the building.' "

   As emergency vehicles and law enforcement officers flooded the streets,
   a helicopter hovered, nearby schools were locked down and airplanes at
   Reagan National Airport were grounded so they would not interfere with
   law-enforcement choppers.

   Security was tightened at other federal buildings. Senate officials
   shut down their side of the Capitol. The House remained open.

   In the confusion, police said around midday that they were searching
   for two accomplices who may have taken part in the attack -- one
   carrying a handgun and wearing a tan Navy-style uniform and a beret,
   the other armed with a long gun and wearing an olive-green uniform.
   Police said it was unclear if the men were members of the military.

   But as the day wore, police dropped one person and then the other as
   suspects. As tensions eased, Navy Yard employees were gradually
   released from the complex, and children were let out of their
   locked-down schools.

   Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of naval operations, was at the base at
   the time the shooting began but was moved unharmed to a nearby military
   installation.

   Anxious relatives and friends of those who work at the complex waited
   to hear from loved ones.

   Tech Sgt. David Reyes, who works at Andrews Air Force Base, said he was
   waiting to pick up his wife, Dina, who was under lockdown in a building
   next to where the shooting happened. She sent him a text message.

   "They are under lockdown because they just don't know," Reyes said.
   "They have to check every building in there, and they have to check
   every room and just, of course, a lot of rooms and a lot of buildings."

   Associated Press writers Jesse Holland, Stacy A. Anderson, Brian Witte
   and Ben Nuckols in Washington contributed to this report.
