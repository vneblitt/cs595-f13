It isn't 2009 anymore

   This is some very interesting video, passed along by the Dem-allied
   American Bridge, of GOP Rep. Joe Heck of Nevada, getting grilled by a
   constituent who knows the Affordable Care Act very well and wants to
   know why Heck would take its benefits away from people:

   IFRAME:
   [308]http://www.youtube.com/embed/En6Y4oBqH6o?feature=player_detailpage

   American Bridge says the constituent isn't a plant, and Heck's office
   tells me they don't think it's a plant, either.

   The constituent, a self-described "business person," says the law has
   already saved him money and will save him more in the future, adding
   that it has already bent the cost curve. "Why would you oppose the ACA
   at every turn?" the man asks. "Why would you oppose something that's
   helping me now?"

   What this sort of encounter confirms, [309]as another similar moment
   with GOP Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina did recently, is that
   we may now be heading into new political territory when it comes to
   Obamacare. Polls continue to show the law remains unpopular and that
   public confusion about it remains rampant. But now that the law's
   concrete benefits are kicking in, it may be harder for Republicans to
   explain their continuing drive to repeal it, particularly to
   constituents who understand what repeal would take away from them.
   We're a long way from the anti-Obamacare town halls of the magical
   Summer of '09.

   Indeed, note that Heck explained his support for repeal by at first
   resorting to a number of well worn arguments -- Dems rammed the law
   through in the dead of night; the bill is 2,700 pages long -- that now
   sound politically dated and irrelevant. But then he went on to allow
   that "there are good things in the bill that we've gotta keep."

   Heck's position is interesting, because he's not as committed to the
   total destruction of Obamacare at all costs as are some of his
   colleagues. (He comes from a district that voted for Obama in 2012, and
   he [310]recently came out for a path to citizenship, calling the Senate
   immigration reform bill's path "reasonable.") Heck's spokesman, Greg
   Lemon, confirms to me that he does not support a government shutdown
   confrontation to force the defunding of Obamacare.

   And as Heck noted to his constituent, he at least recognizes that we
   need to keep some aspects of the Affordable Care Act. While Heck wasn't
   specific in the above video, it seems reasonable to assume that Heck
   supports some of the consumer protections in the law, as some other GOP
   officials say they do.

   How Republicans would keep, say, the protection for people with
   preexisting conditions while doing away with the individual mandate
   [311]is a good question on its own. But that aside, the problem for
   lawmakers like Heck is that, when House Republicans try to pass just
   popular provisions such as the preexisting conditions piece,
   [312]conservatives revolt, because they [313]fear it will weaken the
   appetite to pursue full repeal and will [314]legitimize an ambitious
   role for the federal government in dramatically expanding coverage to
   the uninsured and in fixing other problems in the health care system.

   Republicans [315]plan to roll out another similar effort to appear
   interested in fixing the health care system this fall, but it very well
   may meet the same fate. In which case even Republicans who don't
   necessarily embrace the destroy-Obamacare-entirely-or-bust posture --
   such as Heck -- will essentially be stuck defending it.

   *****************************************************

   UPDATE: Heck's office says the speaker is a constituent -- a small
   business owner in Las Vegas -- but one who also works with Dem groups
   like OFA. However, Heck "takes all comers at town halls," his office
   says, so it's not as if his questions were somehow invalid.

   Indeed, proponents of Obamacare are actively working to put pressure on
   GOP lawmakers to create situations like these, in order to demonstrate
   that the pro-repeal position may prove hard to defend.

   UPDATE II: The constitutent is Ron Nelsen of Las Vegas, who owns and
   operates "[316]Pioneer Overhead Door." Nelson has participated in OFA
   meetings, but he says he's not an official organizer. In any case Heck
   is his Congressman, and Nelsen says he was there in his capacity as a
   Heck constituent.

   "I wasn't there representing anyone but myself, my company, my
   employees and my family," he tells me.
