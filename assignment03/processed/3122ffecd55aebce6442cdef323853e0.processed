Witnesses recount gunshots, confusion at Navy Yard

   [297][NavyYardSTILL2.jpg]

   Video: Witnesses describe the chaotic scene at the Washington Navy Yard
   on Monday morning, where at least one gunman opened fire and the death
   toll rose to more than a dozen.

By [298]Susan Svrluga, [299]Jenna Johnson and [300]Steve Hendrix, E-mail the
writer

   Some heard a burst of shots as they went about their morning routines.
   Others were startled by fire alarms but thought it was just a drill.
   Many were still commuting to the Washington Navy Yard when they
   received e-mails and alerts telling them to stay away.

   Some employees locked themselves in offices and closets for hours,
   waiting for rescue without much food and with spotty cellphone
   reception. Others fled their buildings, gathering in a drizzling rain
   to share their experiences and try to piece together what had happened.

   [navyYardshooting.jpg]

   (The Washington Post)

   Tim Jirus, a U.S. Navy commander, was working on the fourth floor of
   Building 197 when he heard two or three shots. It was distant, and he
   couldn't tell if it was real.

   Suddenly, people ran through the cubicles, shouting, "Get out!" The
   fire alarm went off. Jirus said he remained calm and joined colleagues
   who were filing out of the building. Outside, he saw a co-worker being
   loaded into a police car. He was told by colleagues that the man had
   been shot. Then he heard more shots.

   Jirus thought he would be safe in an alley next to his building, where
   he hid and talked with a civilian about what was unfolding. Then came
   the sound of two more gunshots -- very loud and echoing through the
   alley. Jirus looked toward the direction of the sound, then looked
   down: The other man had fallen to the ground, shot in the head, and
   apparently dead.

   Jirus said he didn't know whether the shooter was on the roof or if he
   could find an open door. He ran, seeing security officers arrive at the
   end of the alley and shelter behind police cars. He was terrified.

   "I was running for my life," said Jirus, 48, who lives in the Dupont
   Circle area.

   He sprinted behind a maintenance building and quickly scaled a tall
   black metal fence, avoiding the spikes at the top. He kept going.

   "I was just lucky," he said. "There were two shots. He got that guy. He
   didn't get me."

   Patricia Ward, a Navy logistics management specialist, said that she
   was at an ATM machine in the first floor atrium of Building 197, home
   to the Naval Sea Systems Command, when she heard loud, short explosions
   coming from a few floors above the open lobby. She and her two
   companions, who were on their way to breakfast, exchanged glances.

   One of Ward's friends started to ask: "Was that a gunshot?" But she was
   interrupted by the sounds of "BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM," Ward said.

   "We knew it then," Ward said. "We just started running."

   A security guard on the sidewalk, her gun drawn, told them to keep
   running. Five blocks away, Ward waited in the drizzle for news of her
   co-workers. She called her manager, who told her to make her way home
   to Woodbridge, even though her purse, phone and other belongings were
   still at her desk.

   The sound of gunfire was a foreign sound on a Monday morning. One Navy
   Yard employee said it sounded like "a guy dropping a wooden pallet."
   Another described it as "someone dropping an old metal desk."

   Then came the fire alarms. The panic. The evacuation or sheltering in
   place. Warning e-mails. Helicopters overhead. Police everywhere. Sirens
   and lights flashing.
