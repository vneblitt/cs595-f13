U.S. News hails Virginia Tech's Masters of Information Technology degree
program for 2013
     __________________________________________________________________



   Students studying U.S. News & World Report has again honored Virginia
   Tech's online Master of Information Technology degree program and its
   College of Engineering programs as among the best distance-learning
   courses in the nation.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., Jan. 24, 2013 - U.S. News & World Report has again
   honored Virginia Tech's online [160]Master of Information Technology
   degree program as one of the nation's best distance-learning courses in
   its recent second-annual Top Online Education rankings.

   The online master's computer information technology program - offered
   by the [161]College of Engineering and the [162]Pamplin College of
   Business - is ranked third in the United States, behind University of
   Southern California in the No. 1 spot, and Sam Houston State University
   in Texas in second.

   The program encompasses the [163]Department of Computer Science and
   the [164]Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,
   both in the College of Engineering; and the [165]Department of
   Accounting and Information Systems, the [166]Department of Business
   Information Technology, and the [167]Department of Management, all in
   the Pamplin College of Business.

   "Virginia Tech's Master of Information Technology program was created
   in 2000 to meet needs of students in Virginia and beyond that were not
   addressed by existing programs. The fully online program was innovative
   at the time and we have continuously improved the program and its
   delivery, as demonstrated by this most recent national ranking," said
   [168]Scott Midkiff, Virginia Tech's vice president for information
   technology and chief information officer, and former department head of
   the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. "In
   addition to serving students, the Masters of Information Technology
   program has helped Virginia Tech continue to explore innovations in
   technology-enabled teaching and learning."

   "We are very pleased with this recognition of the Master of Information
   Technology program at Virginia Tech," said [169]Parviz Ghandforoush,
   professor with the Department of Business Information Technology and
   managing director of the Master of Information Technology program.
   "Courses in the program are taught by a dedicated group of senior level
   faculty using a state of the art technology where students from several
   states in the U.S., along with those from many foreign nations
   participate online in this program."

   "The Department of Computer Science is very pleased with the high
   national ranking of the Virginia Tech [Master of Information
   Technology] program, which we offer in collaboration with the Pamplin
   School of Business," said [170]Barbara Ryder, head of the Department of
   Computer Science and the J. Byron Maupin Professor of
   Engineering. "This program is an important component of our outreach to
   the business professional community."

   The Virginia Tech College of Engineering ranked 13th overall in the
   nation for Best Online Graduate Engineering Programs, according to the
   2013 list. It is the only engineering distance-learning program ranked
   from the Commonwealth of Virginia.

   Boasting more than 2,000 graduate students, the College of
   Engineering's graduate program has been honored time and again by U.S.
   News & World Report as a national leader. It ranks [171]24th overall in
   the nation for 2013 in a separate list released in spring 2012.

    "I am pleased with the recognition of the continued efforts of the
   College of Engineering and the Pamplin College to provide quality
   online certificates and degrees to engineers across the commonwealth
   and beyond," said [172]Glenda Scales, associate dean for international
   programs and information technology for the College of Engineering.

   Virginia Tech offers a total of 37 distance-learning programs online,
   with 18 graduate degrees and 17 graduate or post-baccalaureate
   certificates through [173]Virginia Tech Online. Additionally, two
   professional course studies are available. The university's first
   online program was launched in 1997.

   This is the second year that U.S. News has issued a Top Online
   Education program ranking. Only degree-granting programs offering
   courses that are 100 percent online were considered for the rankings,
   U.S. News said in its release of the 2013 list.

   Online bachelor's degree programs as well as graduate online degree
   programs in business, engineering, nursing, education, and computer
   information technology were ranked. The rankings consider each program
   by teaching practices and student engagement, faculty credentials and
   training, and student services and technology.

   Online master's degrees were ranked using student accreditation as
   opposed to student assessment, and an added ranking category for
   admissions selectivity.

   In its report, citing a 2012 report by Learning House, U.S. News said,
   "Roughly 80 percent of online students live within 100 miles of their
   school's campus or learning center, and the vast majority of those
   students live within 50 miles. This proximity can help students
   overcome one of their main complaints of online programs: lack of
   face-to-face time with instructors."

   the [174]U.S. News & World Report website.

   Dedicated to its motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), [175]Virginia
   Tech takes a hands-on, engaging approach to education, preparing
   scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the
   commonwealth's most comprehensive university and its leading research
   institution, Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree
   programs to more than 30,000 students and manages a research portfolio
   of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of
   transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and
   by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and
   across Virginia.
