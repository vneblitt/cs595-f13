September 12, 2013 from 8:30 a.m. â 4:30 p.m.

   The Longevity of Human Civilization: Will Web Survive Our
   World-Changing Technologies?
   Will human civilization on Earth be imperiled, or enhanced, by our own
   world-changing technologies? Will our technological abilities threaten
   our survival as a species, or even threaten the Earth as a whole, or
   will we come to live comfortably with these new powers? Baruch S.
   Blumberg NASA/Library of Congress Chair in Astrobiology David Grinspoon
   convenes scientists, humanists, journalists, and authors to explore
   these questions from a wide range of perspectives, and to discuss the

Event Recap

   How will the longevity of human civilization be affected by
   world-changing technologies? Kluge Center Astrobiology Chair David
   Grinspoon and prominent scientists, humanists, journalists, and science
   fiction writers aimed to address this question at a symposium on
   Thursday September 12.

   The symposiumâs first panel asked what is the nature of âNature,â and
   what should we choose to save. Paleoanthropologist Rick Potts,
   materials scientist Odile Madden, and journalist David Biello discussed
   how societal and cultural values inform what of nature is preserved and
   what information about nature is transferred between generations.

   The dayâs second panel explored the future in literary and scientific
   imagination.  Professor Ursula Heise, astronomer Steven Dick, and
   science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson offered contrasting views
   on how humans imagine the future, informed by history, scientific
   discovery, and social and cultural differences.

   The third panel asked if humans can form a healthy, stable, long-term
   relationship with technology and the biosphere. Astronomer Seth
   Shostak, science writer Andrew Revkin, atmospheric scientist Ken
   Caldeira and planetary climatologist Jacob Haqq-Misra debated how
   taking a short-term or long-term perspective on the question makes
   great impact on how to answer it. The panelists discussed how human
   civilization may survive, and what the quality of civilization may
   be.

   The final panel invited all speakers to the stage to engage with the
   audience in discussion. David Grinspoon said that, in his estimation,
   the largest threat to human civilization would be a lack of developing
   a healthy relationship with technology. The sciences and the humanities
   can offer solutions for a long-lasting healthy civilization, he said.

   Photographs from the event are now available on the event webpage. A
   full webcast of the symposium will be available in the coming weeks.
   Highlights and insights from the discussions can be found on Twitter:

   The John W. Kluge Center was established at the Library of Congress in
   2000 to foster a mutually enriching relationship between the world of
   ideas and the world of action, between scholars and political leaders.
   The Center attracts outstanding scholarly figures to Washington, D.C.,
   facilitates their access to the Libraryâs remarkable collections, and
   helps them engage in conversation with policymakers and the public.
