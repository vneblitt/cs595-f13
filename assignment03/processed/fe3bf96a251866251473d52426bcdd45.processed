   The United Nations is an international organization founded in 1945
   after the Second World War by 51 countries committed to maintaining
   international peace and security, developing friendly relations among
   nations and promoting social progress, better living standards and
   human rights.

The UN has 4 main purposes

     * To keep peace throughout the world;
     * To develop friendly relations among nations;
     * To help nations work together to improve the lives of poor people,
       to conquer hunger, disease and illiteracy, and to encourage respect
       for each other's rights and freedoms;
     * To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve
       these goals.

   Due to its unique international character, and the powers vested in its
   founding Charter, the Organization can take action on a wide range of
   issues, and provide a forum for its 193 Member States to express their
   views, through the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic
   and Social Council and other bodies and committees.

   The work of the United Nations reaches every corner of the globe.
   Although best known for peacekeeping, peacebuilding, conflict
   prevention and humanitarian assistance, there are many other ways the
   United Nations and its System (specialized agencies, funds and
   programmes) affect our lives and make the world a better place. The
   Organization works on a broad range of fundamental issues, from
   sustainable development, environment and refugees protection, disaster
   relief, counter terrorism, disarmament and non-proliferation, to
   promoting democracy, human rights, gender equality and the advancement
   of women, governance, economic and social development and international
   health, clearing landmines, expanding food production, and more, in
   order to achieve its goals and coordinate efforts for a safer world for
   this and future generations.
