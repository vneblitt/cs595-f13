   Hundreds remain unaccounted for as Colorado authorities try to reach
   people cut off by the severe floods in their state. Thousands of homes
   have been destroyed or damaged. (Sept. 16)
   Tribune wire report

   12:29 p.m. CDT, September 16, 2013
   DENVER--

   The confirmed death toll from flooding triggered by a week of
   torrential downpours along the eastern slopes of the Rockies in
   Colorado rose to seven on Monday, according to a spokeswoman for the
   Boulder County Office of Emergency Management.

   The spokeswoman, Liz Donaghey, said the latest tally of confirmed dead
   was transmitted to county officials from the Federal Emergency
   Management Agency.

       flooding in Colorado

   It was not immediately clear whether the count of seven dead includes
   two women reported missing and presumed dead by Larimer County
   officials since Sunday.

   Drier weather after historic floods triggered by seven-straight days of
   rain held out hope for relief in Colorado, where hundreds of people
   were still stranded or displaced on Monday.

   Micki Trost, a spokeswoman for the emergency office, said the death
   toll may still rise, but the number of people unaccounted for had
   dropped below 1,000 on Monday because of ongoing search-and-rescue
   efforts.

   Teams of rescue workers were fanning across flood-hit portions of the
   state.

   "They'll take advantage of the weather today and help out everyone they
   can," Trost said. "We hope that those weather forecasts stay in our
   favor."

   The weather began to clear overnight, and only a light drizzle and
   patchy fog were left to hamper helicopter rescue missions early on
   Monday, according to Byron Louis of the National Weather Service office
   in Boulder.

   The air rescue operations are the biggest in the United States since
   Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, National Guard
   officials said.

   Louis said some areas had been drenched by as much as 16 inches of rain
   in just three days, the average for an entire year.

   "I've been in this office for 30-plus years, and I've never seen this
   type of rain, never," he said.

   President Barack Obama declared the area a major disaster over the
   weekend, freeing up federal funds and resources to aid state and local
   governments.

   U.S. Army and National Guard troops have rescued 1,750 people cut off
   by washed-out roads in the mountain canyons of Boulder and Larimer
   counties, Army spokesman Major Earl Brown said in a statement.

   State officials would be unable to assess the overall damage until
   rescue efforts were complete and the floodwaters receded, said Trost,
   the Colorado Office of Emergency Management spokeswoman.
