So near, so far, at Harvard

A look at the Class of 2017, by the numbers

   September 9, 2013 | Editor's Pick Popular

   The similarities between Victoria Basedow (left) of Eden Hills,
   Australia -- the incoming Harvard freshman from the farthest locale --
   and Cambridge's own Serena Blacklow -- the closest -- don't begin and
   end with their last names. The new students are also both rowers.
   By Corydon Ireland, Harvard Staff Writer

   A quick look at the demographics of Harvard's Class of 2017 yields a
   few basics: 1,600 members, more men (52.4 percent) than women, 57
   countries and every state except Wyoming represented.

   But take a closer look at the makeup of the 375th freshman class. The
   exclusive group represents a record-low 5.8 percent of applicants. (The
   pool of applicants totaled 35,022, also a record.) And the class is
   receiving record-high financial aid. That means the freshmen represent
   a new level of economic diversity.

   There are other kinds of diversity too, with social meanings that go as
   deep. For instance, the freshmen come from 14 African countries, from
   Ethiopia to Swaziland to Zimbabwe. Some, including students from
   Tunisia and Egypt, experienced the Arab Spring at the street level.
   Harvard also accepted its first freshman in decades from Iran.

   Dig deeper, and the class yields other demographic gems, such as a
   freshman from Easter Island, a territory of Chile so remote that the
   nearest inhabited place is 1,289 miles away. (That's Pitcairn Island,
   with about 50 residents.) Class members come from distances small as
   well as great. Ten freshmen are from Harvard College's own ZIP code,
   02138. Of those, at least three could exit their own homes and be in
   Radcliffe Yard inside a minute. At the other extreme, six come to
   Harvard from Australia, where people drive their cars on the left and
   water faucets open to the right.

   The student from closest to Harvard Yard (about 1,000 yards) and the
   one from farthest away (almost 11,000 miles) are both women, both
   competitive rowers, both drawn to the sciences, and both have names
   that begin with "B" and end in "ow."  Victoria Basedow is from Eden
   Hills, a southern suburb of Adelaide, Australia. "It sounds more
   exciting than it is," she said. Her family home, about 10,758 miles
   from Harvard Square, puts Basedow, who now lives in Grays Hall, four
   miles farther than classmate and fellow Australian Jack Kelly.

   Victoria Basedow's family home is about 10,758 miles from Harvard
   Square. Her plane trip to Harvard required 25 hours in the air, plus
   stopovers.

   Serena Blacklow's Ash Street, Cambridge, home is one minute from
   Radcliffe and seven from Harvard Yard. The house was where T.S. Eliot
   boarded while he was at Harvard College more than a century ago.
   (Blacklow's brother, she said, sleeps in the poet's onetime bedroom on
   the third floor.)

   "I haven't been home since move-in day," she said, and, despite the
   proximity, settling into her neighborhood college "was still a big deal
   to me." Blacklow, a graduate of Buckingham Browne & Nichols, a
   Cambridge day school, comes from just a few hundred yards closer to
   Harvard than two other new freshmen from nearby Hawthorn Street.

   Blacklow enrolled in a freshman seminar on the iconic modern dance
   choreographer George Balanchine. But the rest of her courses are in
   math, physics, and the life sciences. Blacklow, who lives in Straus
   Hall, spent the last two summers as an intern at a Harvard
   crystallography lab.

   Basedow won mathematics prizes in Australia and will concentrate on
   math or engineering at Harvard. Rowing was another draw. "That's the
   main reason I came," she said of crew, in which she won medals and
   recognition at home. Universities in the United States, Basedow added,
   do a better job of integrating athletics with studies, and
   intercollegiate competition is more robust here.

   Crew also drew Blacklow, a competitive rower for five years. "The
   Charles is right there when you live in Cambridge," she said. And
   despite some pollution, "there's still some nature," said Blacklow,
   "and a great view of Boston." She plans to join the [83]Radcliffe
   lightweight crew, whose roster last year included students from Canada,
   Germany, Australia, and 16 U.S. states.

   Basedow's plane trip to Harvard required 25 hours in the air, plus
   stopovers. But the continental United States was not exactly a
   surprise. "All of our TV shows and music come out of America," she
   said, and clothing and landscapes seem familiar, too. But portion sizes
   in American restaurants are big, added Basedow, and "when you enter a
   building here, you pull the door to yourself." Harvard Yard itself, on
   first sight, was "pretty amazing," she said. "The buildings are so
   grand."

   To Blacklow, of course, not much about the Yard is a surprise. (She
   spends a lot of time giving people directions and said, "I don't mind
   being from Cambridge.") But before move-in day, "I hadn't ever really
   just stood in the Yard and looked at it," she admitted. "I love that
   all the buildings are brick."

   "I don't mind being from Cambridge," said Serena Blacklow, who says she
   spends a lot of time giving people directions.

   As for having home so close, her parents set down just one rule: no
   dropping off the laundry -- a chore that Blacklow likes doing at
   Harvard anyway. The food in Annenberg Hall is fine, though a "really
   good meal" can be had on Ash Street when she feels like it. "They'd
   love to see me, but I don't know that I want to see them." Her point
   there is that she's so busy: open houses for concentrations, trying out
   for the freshman talent show, and meeting other rowers.

   Blacklow and Basedow say they were both bowled over by the economic,
   ethnic, and geographic diversity of the fellow students they met in the
   first two weeks. "I've met so many people from all around the world,"
   said Blacklow.
