Researchers explore genetic links between nicotine, cancer using

   BLACKSBURG, Va., July 29, 2013 - Researchers at the Virginia
   Bioinformatics Institute have taken a closer look at the role that
   nicotine plays in cancer, finding new consequences of nicotine stress
   on breast tissue and insight into the influence of nicotine on normal
   cells.

   Nicotine is the addictive chemical found in cigarettes, but researchers
   believe that it could have more influence than previously realized on
   the underlying genetics of cancer, according to a recently published
   [160]study in the journal PLOS One. Tobacco smoke contains many
   chemicals, including nicotine, but nicotine stands out because of its
   widely accepted connection to cancer, especially lung cancer.

   Using next-generation sequencing techniques, Jasmin Bavarva, a research
   geneticist and lead author of the study, showed more thoroughly how
   nicotine causes healthy cells to become cancerous and revealed new
   participation from previously unstudied genes.

   Next-generation sequencing allows researchers to see a broad range of
   gene interactions in ways that supersede standard techniques, such as
   microarrays.

   "The all-inclusive approach of next-generation sequencing is a
   game-changer, as it allows us to find previously unknown genetic
   links," Bavarva said.

   Knowing how the genes interact can help researchers understand the
   complex nature of cancer and find treatments, the researchers said.

   "The changes seen in cells after exposure to nicotine must make us now
   realize that nicotine is not just an addicting chemical, but it also is
   a gene-expression modulator, which may play a direct role in cancer
   development. We may need to rethink how we use it to treat tobacco
   addiction," said Harold R. Garner, a professor of biological science,
   computer science, and basic science affiliated with the College of
   Science, the College of Engineering, and the Virginia Tech Carilion
   School of Medicine, who led the research.

   The [161]Virginia Bioinformatics Institute at Virginia Tech is a
   premier bioinformatics, computational biology, and systems biology
   research facility that uses transdisciplinary approaches to science
   combining information technology, biology, and medicine. These
   approaches are used to interpret and apply vast amounts of biological
   data generated from basic research to some of today's key challenges in
   the biomedical, environmental, and agricultural sciences. With more
   than 240 highly trained multidisciplinary, international personnel,
   research at the institute involves collaboration in diverse disciplines
   such as mathematics, computer science, biology, plant pathology,
   biochemistry, systems biology, statistics, economics, synthetic
   biology, and medicine. The large amounts of data generated by this
   approach are analyzed and interpreted to create new knowledge that is
   disseminated to the world's scientific, governmental, and wider
   communities.
