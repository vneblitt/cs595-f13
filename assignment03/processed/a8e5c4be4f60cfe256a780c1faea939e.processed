Economic Benefits of Increasing Electric Grid Resilience to Weather Outages

   In June 2011, President Obama released A Policy Framework for the 21st
   Century Grid which set out a four-pillared strategy for modernizing the
   electric grid. The initiative directed billions of dollars toward
   investments in 21st century smart grid technologies focused at
   increasing the grid's efficiency, reliability, and resilience, and
   making it less vulnerable to weather-related outages and reducing the
   time it takes to restore power after an outage occurs.

   Grid resilience is increasingly important as climate change increases
   the frequency and intensity of severe weather. Greenhouse gas emissions
   are elevating air and water temperatures around the world. Scientific
   research predicts more severe hurricanes, winter storms, heat waves,
   floods and other extreme weather events being among the changes in
   climate induced by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gasses.

   Severe weather is the leading cause of power outages in the United
   States. Between 2003 and 2012, an estimated 679 widespread power
   outages occurred due to severe weather. Power outages close schools,
   shut down businesses and impede emergency services, costing the economy
   billions of dollars and disrupting the lives of millions of Americans.
   The resilience of the U.S. electric grid is a key part of the nation's
   defense against severe weather and remains an important focus of
   President Obama's administration.

   This report estimates the annual cost of power outages caused by severe
   weather between 2003 and 2012 and describes various strategies for
   modernizing the grid and increasing grid resilience. Over this period,
   weather-related outages are estimated to have cost the U.S. economy an
   inflation-adjusted annual average of $18 billion to $33 billion. Annual
   costs fluctuate significantly and are greatest in the years of major
   storms such as Hurricane Ike in 2008, a year in which cost estimates
   range from $40 billion to $75 billion, and Superstorm Sandy in 2012, a
   year in which cost estimates range from $27 billion to $52 billion. A
   recent Congressional Research Service study estimates the
   inflation-adjusted cost of weather-related outages at $25 to $70
   billion annually (Campbell 2012). The variation in estimates reflects
   different assumptions and data used in the estimation process. The
   costs of outages take various forms including lost output and wages,
   spoiled inventory, delayed production, inconvenience and damage to the
   electric grid. Continued investment in grid modernization and
   resilience will mitigate these costs over time - saving the economy
   billions of dollars and reducing the hardship experienced by millions
   of Americans when extreme weather strikes.
