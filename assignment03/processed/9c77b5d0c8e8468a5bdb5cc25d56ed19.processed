News from the David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat

   [102]Sign up to get panda news from the Zoo.

   Giant pandas are black and white bears that live in temperate-zone
   bamboo forests in central China. Among the best recognized--but
   rarest--animals in the world, they have come to symbolize endangered
   species and conservation efforts. As few as 1,600 giant pandas survive
   in the mountain forests of central China. More than 300 pandas live in
   zoos and breeding centers around the world; most of these pandas are in
   China.
   [103]Watch the Panda Cam

   Giant pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian are at the National Zoo under a
   Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement, signed in
   January 2011, between the Zoo and the China Wildlife Conservation
   Association. This extends the Zoo's giant panda program through 2015.
   Mei and Tian are the focus of an ambitious research, conservation, and
   breeding program designed to preserve this endangered species.

Viewing Pandas at the Zoo

     * With the birth of Mei Xiang's cub, the Panda House will remain
       closed.
     * Visitors can see Tian Tian when he is outdoors.
     * Red pandas are only visible from the upper viewing area.

September 26

   The panda team was able to perform another full veterinary exam on the
   cub today. Mei Xiang is routinely coming out of her den in the mornings
   to eat bamboo and drink. This morning when she left her den, the panda
   team closed the door that connects the den to her adjacent enclosure
   and retrieved the cub.

   The exam went very well and the cub has grown substantially since last
   week. She now weighs 3.07 pounds (1.395 kg), and sheâs 11.4 inches (29
   cm) around her belly. At her last exam, September 16, she weighed in at
   just under 2 pounds and measured 9.8 inches (25 cm) wide around her
   belly. Now, she is over 14 inches (36 cm) long with each of her paws
   1.5 inches (4 cm) long. Veterinarians listened to her heart and lungs,
   which sound healthy.

   The cub is very active and keepers said she is very wiggly and squirmy.
   Sheâs trying to support her own weight. Her eyes have not opened yet,
   and wonât for a few more weeks. After the exam was completed, the panda
   team returned the cub to the den. When Mei Xiang came back to the den
   she immediately picked the cub up and started grooming her.
