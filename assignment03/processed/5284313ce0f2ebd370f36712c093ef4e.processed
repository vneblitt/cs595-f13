   students walking In its America's Best Graduate Schools 2014 survey,
   U.S. News & World Report once again hails Virginia Tech's College of
   Engineering, Pamplin College of Business, and College of Architecture
   and Urban Studies as having stellar national programs.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., March 12, 2013 - Updated: March 13, 2013

   Virginia Tech's [160]College of Engineering for the third consecutive
   year ranks 24th among the nation's best engineering schools for
   graduate studies, according to U.S. News and World Report's America's
   Best Graduate Schools 2014 survey released today.

   Additionally, the [161]Pamplin College of Business jumped to 34th from
   37th among top part-time master's of business administration programs.

   More standout rankings: Virginia Tech's public affairs program in the
   School of Public and International Affairs, part of the [162]College of
   Architecture and Urban Studies, again ranks 37th in the nation for the
   fourth year in a row, tying with Cornell University in New York,
   University of Arizona, University of Delaware, and the University of
   Illinois-Chicago, a feat repeated from the [163]2013 Best Graduate
   Schools survey released spring of last year. In the same college, the
   [164]Center for Public Administration and Policy ranked 17th.

   Boasting more than 2,000 graduate students, the College of
   Engineering's graduate program ranks as the highest ranked engineering
   school in Virginia. Among fellow public universities, it ranks among
   the top 13 universities in the nation for engineering.

   "Our hands-on, minds-on philosophy of education at Virginia Tech has
   always been the backbone of our outstanding reputation, one not
   possible without the immense talent of our faculty, who help guide and
   work closely with our graduate students," said [165]Richard C. Benson,
   dean of the College of Engineering. "Our students regularly collaborate
   on ground-breaking research projects, including working to make
   [166]helmeted sports such as football safer, building a [167]humanoid
   robot that one day could save lives during a disaster, and other robots
   that can [168]mimic jellyfish in appearance and action, while helping
   safeguard the oceans and seas of the world. These projects exemplify
   our motto of Ut Prosim, That I May Serve."

   The magazine gives high marks to several of the College of
   Engineering's programs and departments, including the [169]Grado
   Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at seventh for
   industrial/ manufacturing programs, the [170]Charles E. Via Jr.
   Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering's civil engineering
   programs ranking seventh;  and the [171]biological systems engineering
   department, also part of the [172]College of Agriculture and Life
   Sciences, ranking ninth among biological/agricultural programs. Other
   ranked programs include: [173]Aerospace at 15th, [174]computer and
   electrical engineering (listed separately) at 19th; environmental (part
   of the civil engineering department) at 13th; and [175]mechanical at
   17th.

   The Pamplin College of Business's jump to 34th among the nation's best
   part-time MBA schools ranks it alongside Colorado State University,
   Lehigh University, and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The jump comes
   after the school's ranking of 37th in the 2013 rankings and 45th in the
   2012 rankings.

   Pamplin's program is based at Virginia Tech's [176]National Capital
   Region campus, near Washington, D.C., and is designed to meet the needs
   of mid-level managers and other full-time professionals with potential
   for advancement in their organizations. It is commonly referred to as
   the Pamplin Evening MBA.

   The [177]College of Science's paleontology program, part of the
   [178]Department of Geoscience, ranks ninth in nation for the third
   consecutive year, again tying with Ohio State University. Elsewhere in
   the college, the [179]Department of Psychology ranks 67th in the
   nation, tying with 10 other universities.  Additional rankings:
   Biological sciences was listed at 92; the [180]Department of Chemistry
   at 53; clinical psychology at 47; earth sciences at 28; geochemistry at
   13th; [181]economics at 58; [182]math at 59; the [183]Department of
   Physics at 63, and [184]statistics at 48.

   The [185]School of Education, part of the [186]College of Liberal Arts
   and Human Sciences, again ties for 100th in the nation, ranking
   alongside City University of New York and Louisiana State University in
   Baton Rouge, La. The [187]Career and Technical Education program ranked
   fourth in the nation, under the listing of Technical/Vocational
   Programs. The [188]Department of Sociology, also part of the college,
   ranked 69th.

   U.S. News and World Report's graduate rankings of colleges, published
   annually since 1987, are based on several categories of data gathered
   from the surveyed schools, plus peer assessments by deans, senior
   faculty, and other professionals in their respective fields. Rankings
   of the specialty programs are based solely on peer assessments. The
   annual survey is intended to provide prospective students with
   information about the nation's top graduate schools and programs of
   study.

   Not all data on college, department, and program rankings is new for
   the 2014 year. For instance, rankings of the College of Engineering and
   the Pamplin College of Business are new, with data collected in 2013.
   However, some data is older. Briefly, rankings for the Department of
   Chemistry date back to 2010; as does information for the
   [189]Department of Computer Science, ranked at 44, and the Department
   of Math. The [190]Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary
   Medicine at Virginia Tech ranks 17th in the nation, from data first
   ranked in 2011.

   Dedicated to its motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), [192]Virginia
   Tech takes a hands-on, engaging approach to education, preparing
   scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the
   commonwealth's most comprehensive university and its leading research
   institution, Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree
   programs to more than 30,000 students and manages a research portfolio
