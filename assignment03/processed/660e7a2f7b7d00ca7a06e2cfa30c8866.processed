   [120]Washington lawyer Flood counsels McDonnell on probe BY JIM NOLAN
   Richmond Times-Dispatch Richmond Times-Dispatch

   He's represented the administration of President George W. Bush, Vice
   President Dick Cheney, and President Bill Clinton during his
   impeachment proceedings.

   Now he's one of the attorneys counseling Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,
   besieged by state and federal investigations into gifts he and his
   family have received while in office.

   High-powered Washington lawyer Emmet T. Flood was in Richmond at the
   Executive Mansion Tuesday to speak with McDonnell, administration
   officials and others as the governor attempts to navigate the
   treacherous legal and political waters that have engulfed the last year
   of his term and threaten to swamp his legacy.

   Also present was former state Attorney General Anthony F. Troy,
   appointed by Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli to represent the governor
   in legal matters related to a state inquiry into gifts and a related
   criminal case alleging embezzlement by the former chef at the Executive
   Mansion.

   The presence of Flood underscores the gravity of the governor's legal
   challenges.

   A partner in the law firm of Williams and Connolly, Flood served as
   deputy White House counsel to former President George W. Bush, where
   was in charge of the administration's response to hundreds of
   Congressional investigations and other inquiries.

   He also represented then-Vice President Dick Cheney in civil litigation
   brought against administration officials by Valerie Plame, a former CIA
   officer. Her identity was disclosed in a newspaper column following a
   report filed by her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson, that was
   critical of the war in Iraq.

   Flood also represented President Bill Clinton in impeachment
   proceedings brought by the U.S. House of Representatives and tried
   before the United States Senate.

   People familiar with the investigations say the McDonnells and Flood
   have been in consultation for months.

   The governor's office for weeks has refused to answer questions on
   Flood's involvement.

   A federal grand jury is expected next week to take testimony from
   witnesses related to a probe of the governor's relationship with
   mega-donor and gift-giving friend Jonnie Williams Sr., the CEO of
   Henrico-based Star Scientific Inc. The troubled former tobacco company
   now promotes dietary supplements derived from the plant and is also
   under a federal securities investigation.

   Williams has showered the governor and first family with tens of
   thousands in gifts beyond the $108,000 in cash and free airfare donated
   to McDonnell's political action committee and campaign. According to
   people familiar with the probes, the gifts include use of a vacation
   home, a shopping spree in New York for first lady Maureen McDonnell and
   a $15,000 check to cover catering costs at the June, 2011 wedding of
   the McDonnells' daughter, Cailin.

   The wedding check was not declared on the governor's statements of
   economic interest because the governor said it was a gift to his
   daughter. Nor was a $6,500 men's Rolex watch that Williams procured for
   Maureen McDonnell, who gave it to her husband as a gift in 2011. The
   governor has refused to say whether he knew the watch was a gift from
   Williams.

   The disclosure of gifts on required statements of economic interest is
   part of a second inquiry that Cuccinelli initiated in November 2012 and
   referred to Richmond Commonwealth's Attorney Michael N. Herring.

   Todd Schneider, a former chef at the mansion, has accused the governor
   and first family of using mansion resources for private political and
   personal events. Schneider has been charged with four counts of felony
   embezzlement related to the theft of food and supplies.

   Schneider, who is set to go on trial in October, has spoken to federal
   and state investigators about his claims and maintains that he was told
   to take food from the mansion in lieu of payment for the personal
   events for which he was not compensated.

   Schneider claims in a court filing by his lawyers that he was the first
   family's "personal shopper and private caterer" called upon to perform
   duties "far beyond the scope" of his employment, work for which he was
   not paid.

   A job description for the executive chef provided by the governor‚s
   office states that the chef ‚prepares meals for the first family,
   guests, and appropriate staff.‚

   ‚Also, the chef prepares food for all events, including: meals hosted
   by the governor and/or first lady; receptions; meetings; holiday
   events; and other special needs as directed by the mansion director.‚

   The description, which a McDonnell spokesman said was in place at the
   time of Schneider‚s hire, concludes with ‚performs other related duties
   as required.‚

   A hearing on a motion to dismiss the charges against Schneider will be
   held Monday in Richmond Circuit Court.
