1938-2013: 75 Years of the Byzantine Object Census at Dumbarton Oaks

   The project to conduct a Census of Byzantine and Early Christian
   Objects in North American Collections began 75 years ago in late 1938
   by Mrs. Mildred Bliss, co-founder of Dumbarton Oaks. It was a way to
   document, catalog, and depict the treasures of Byzantium in museums and
   private collections all over North America for research access in one
   place here in Dumbarton Oaks, similar to [23]Princetonâs Index of
   Christian Art. And in the uncertain times before World War II, it was
   also a way to obtain detailed information and photographic surrogates
   for these objects, in the eventuality of damage or destruction if war
   broke out on this side of the Atlantic.

   The Census changed names over the course of time as its scope was
   developed and refined. In one of the earliest references in late 1939,
   it was called the âCensus of Early Christian, Byzantine and related
   arts in the United States and Canadaâ (in Elizabeth Dowâs report of the
   Forty-First General Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America,
   American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 44, No. 1, p. 115). In the
   1941-1942 Dumbarton Oaks Annual Report (p. 5), it was called the
   âCensus of Late Antique and Early Mediaeval Objects in American
   Collections,â but was later referred to as the âCensus of Objects of
   Early Christian and Byzantine Art in the United States and Canada,â or
   alternatively the âCensus of Byzantine and Early Christian Objects in
   North American Collections.â Likely the term Byzantine was added to
   emphasize the eastern Mediterranean focus. After that it was simply
   called the âByzantine Object Censusâ for short.

   The Census project was administered by Elizabeth Dow (later Elizabeth
   Dow Pritchett) from 1938 to 1943, with the assistance of textile
   specialist Louisa Bellinger from 1939 to 1942. Work resumed in the
   mid-1950s through 1966; the Census was added to as late as the
   mid-1980s. Textiles were but one subset of the Byzantine Object Census,
   which included many types of media: bronze, ceramics, glass, metalwork,
   leather, mosaic, wood, etc. Bellinger was the expert textile analyst,
   while Dow Pritchett handled all the other formats and served as overall
   project manager.

   Bellinger also wrote and edited an inhouse newsletter at Dumbarton
   Oaks, [24]The Underworld Courier, for the duration of its existence
   from January to October 1941. These âeditionsâ were actually typed
   letters with photographs, musical programs, stories, drawings, and
   notes tipped in so as to keep Mr. and Mrs. Bliss up to date on
   Dumbarton Oaks happenings while Mr. Bliss was convalescing in
   California from an illness. Any serious textile student would want to
   read these for Bellingerâs detailed fiber notes. The photo belowÂ of
   Bellinger examining weave and spinning with a textile tube came from a
   February 9, 1941, Sunday Star newspaper clipping, attached to the
   February 15, 1941, edition of the [25]Underworld Courier (v. 1, no. 6,
   p. 7).

   As far as we can tell, the Byzantine Object Census project seemed to
   work like this:Â  an introductory letter and blank survey forms
   (âobject reports,â see sample below) were sent to institutions and
   private collectors in North America known to hold articles of Early
   Christian and Byzantine art. Then, participating institutions filled
   out the object reports and mailed them back to Dumbarton Oaks. Project
   staff sifted through the forms, made selections, and ordered
   photographs of specific works to be included in the pictorial Census.
   These prints would be mailed to Dumbarton Oaks where they would be
   processed: mounted on board, assigned an accession number, and then a
   catalog card linking the description to the photograph of the object
   would be createdâan analog precursor to the relational database!

   In the early years of the Census, between 1939 and 1942, Dow and
   Bellinger frequently traveled to museums with numerically large or
   incompletely cataloged Byzantine collections to examine the registrars'
   records, identify uncataloged items, and make their selections in
   person. Bellinger actually spent several months in late 1940 at the
   Field Museum in Chicago, documenting and analyzing textiles there. One
   issue of the Underground Courier goes into marvelous detail about
   working with the textiles in the rarefied Mummy Case and the
   astonishment of schoolchildren watching her work through a small window
   inside that âsealedâ chamber (Administrative Papers, Louisa Bellinger,
   [26]Underworld Courier, v. 1, no. 4, p. 2.)

   Bellinger conducted scholarly research in the form of onsite
   examinations and technical experiments to document the creation,
   purpose, and history of textile works for various Byzantine, Coptic,
   and Middle Eastern collections throughout the United States and Canada.
   The objective of Bellingerâs experiments was to determine the creation
   processes of specific textile fabrics by studying their individual
   components, such as linen, flax, or wool. After the fibers used in a
   textile work were identified, Bellinger would conduct further
   experiments involving environmental and chemical changes to test the
   durability of specific types of fabrics. Bellingerâs experiments are
   documented in photographs, negatives, slides, and films. Her scrapbook,
   pictured below, contains timed photos of experimentsÂ with actual
   scraps of fiber, wood ...Â and copious notes.

   Although the Textile Census was apparently never supplemented after
   Bellinger left Dumbarton Oaks in 1942, the Object Census was resumed by
   Ms. Fanny Bonajuto from 1956 until 1966 and continued to be updated by
   Library staff through the mid-1980s. As of 2013âthe 75^th anniversary
   of the start of the Censusâsome pieces of the puzzle are still missing:
   painstakingly crafted accession numbers on negatives have no
   corresponding inventory lists or descriptions, some object reports have
   no photographs, and some photographs have no object reports. Bits and
   pieces have been found all over the repository and reunited, but it
   remains a mystery why such a useful tool was allowed to fall into
   disuse. Now itâs our job to âput Humpty Dumpty back together again.â
   Research in the collection is welcomed, although be warned: we might
   put you to work solving a few outstanding mysteries!
