   Internship programme

   Why be a United Nations intern?

   If you are thinking of entering the world of diplomacy and public
   policy, an internship at the United Nations could be the ideal start
   for you.

   The objective of the internship is to give you a first-hand impression
   of the day-to-day working environment of the United Nations. You will
   be given a real chance to work with our people. As part of our team,
   working directly with outstanding and inspiring career professionals
   and senior management, you will be exposed to high-profile conferences,
   participate in meetings, and contribute to analytical work as well as
   organizational policy of the United Nations. Initially you will take on
   the amount of responsibility you can shoulder; the potential for
   growth, however, is yours to develop.

   Can you be a United Nations intern?
     * Are you enrolled in a Master's or Ph.D. programme or are in your
       fifth year of studies towards the completion of a university degree
       equivalent to a Masters degree?
     * Do you have excellent command of English or French?
