Mosquitoes reared in cooler temperatures more susceptible to viruses that can
affect human health

   BLACKSBURG, Va., June 6, 2013 - Urban epidemics resulting from viral
   diseases, such as West Nile fever and chikungunya fever, are
   transmitted by infected mosquitoes.

   According to Virginia Tech scientists, mosquitoes reared in cooler
   temperatures have weaker immune systems, making them more susceptible
   to dangerous viruses and more likely to transmit them to people.

   The connection between temperature and the mosquito's immune system,
   published May 31, 2013, in [160]PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, is
   significant in light of global climate change, said researchers Kevin
   Myles and Zach Adelman, associate professors of entomology in
   the [161]College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and affiliates of
   the [162]Fralin Life Science Institute.

   "Our data offers a plausible hypothesis for how changes in weather
   influence the transmission of these diseases and will likely continue
   to do so in the future," Myles said.

   A variety of weather anomalies may occur with global changes in
   climate. However, predicting these weather anomalies is difficult due
   to the enormous complexity involved. Nevertheless, the work of Myles
   and Adelman suggests that it would be unwise to focus solely on warmer
   temperatures when considering links between climate change and disease
   transmission.

   "Mosquitoes like to breed and lay their eggs in dark, cool places
   because that means the water will last longer," Adelman said. "They
   don't lay their eggs in sunny spots because that will dry the water out
   in a day or two. Although this has been known of some time, we are just
   learning about its potential affects on the mosquito immune response.
   Hopefully, this information can be used to build better models that
   more correctly predict when we'll have disease transmission."

   Current computational outbreak models consider such things as
   meteorological variables and human population indexes but have failed
   to consider the effect of temperature on mosquito immunity, he added.
   Specifically, Adelman and Myles found that the mosquito's RNA
   interference pathway is impaired when reared at cooler temperatures.

   The rate of transmission of both diseases has increased with outbreaks
   occurring in unexpected places, such as the introductions of West Nile
   virus to New York in 1999, and chikungunya virus to Italy and France in
   2007 and 2010.

   The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the
   National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, and the
   Fralin Life Science Institute.

   Co-authors on the paper include Michelle A.E. Anderson, a research
   technician in the department of entomology and the College of
   Agriculture and Life Sciences, Michael R. Wiley of Ambler, Pa., a Ph.D.
   student in the department of entomology and the College of Agriculture
   and Life Sciences, Marta G. Murreddu and Glady Hazitha Samuel, both
   post-doctoral research associates in the department of entomology and
   the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Elaine M. Morazzani
   of Vienna, Va., a Ph.D. student in the department of entomology and the
   College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
