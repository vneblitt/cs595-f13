Preparing For The Worst: Training Journalists For Reporting In War Zones

   by Lori Grisham
   August 06, 2013 5:51 PM

   Two passenger vans full of NPR staffers headed up a mountain in May,
   trying to get to a press conference behind rebel lines. It wasn't going
   to be easy.
   Hostile environment training includes learning how bullets react to
   different kinds of materials such as car metal, bricks and cinder
   blocks. Sandbags or dirt formations offer the best protection.

   "I was sitting in the passenger seat. We got to the first checkpoint,
   and we could see that they were drunk and very hostile," correspondent
   Carrie Kahn said. "I was trying not to make eye contact, but was
   immediately pulled out of the car." The people at the checkpoint had
   weapons and things escalated. Then producer Tom Bullock stepped in and
   diffused the situation, at least for the time being.

   "Ultimately Tom bartered some cigarettes and some money," Kahn said.
   "But then we had to wait for the car behind us."

   Fortunately, none of this really happened. It was actually a training
   exercise simulating real-life scenarios NPR journalists could face
   while reporting from hot spots.

   Preparing for War Zones and Natural Disasters
   International correspondents often bring us news from unstable or
   perilous regions of the world. They face hostile checkpoints, war
   zones, kidnappings, suicide bombers and landmines. (And that's only the
   short list). To help them prepare for those kinds of situations, NPR
   arranged for 22 digital and broadcast staff members to attend a
   three-day "hostile environment training" course earlier this year.

   The course is "part of NPR's overall approach to training and safety
   and looking after our staff in the field, particularly in many of the
   increasingly dangerous parts of the world," said David Sweeney,
   managing editor of news operations.

   The training consists of a mix of lectures and hands-on scenarios led
   by two trainers experienced with hostile environments and knowledgeable
   about weapons.
   The three-day session was held at a retreat center outside of
   Washington, D.C. Staff said it wasn't fancy -ÂÂ they slept on metal
   bunk beds (check out these room number assignments) and shared
   bathrooms - but they did enjoy the meals. [26]Enlarge image [27]i

   For the last 10 years, NPR has sent international-based correspondents
   and producers to similar sessions. However, they were often held in the
   UK and attended by only a few NPR journalists at a time. This was the
   first in-house training program of its kind and was funded, in part, by
   a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Sweeney said.

   Sweeney selected a mix of broadcast and digital staff, as well as
   managers and frontline editors, producers and reporters to attend this
   training. "The more staff we have with a broad range of skills the
   better," he said. "It's not just about war zones, but also having the
   knowledge and skills to work in the aftermath of a hurricane or an
   earthquake or other natural disaster."

   Over the last few years there has been a push to get more people
   trained, said Edith Chapin, supervising senior editor on the
   International Desk. "Anybody can find themselves in that kind of
   situation. Everybody needs to be prepared for this."

   In some of the sessions, staffers would take turns role-playing. For
   example, sometimes they would be the ones trying to go through the
   checkpoints and sometimes they would be the guards.

   Middle East Editor Doug Roberts made the most intimidating checkpoint
   person, said Kahn, who is based in Mexico City. "Right after the
   training I had to go through many checkpoints in Honduras, but they
   weren't as scary as getting through the checkpoints with Doug Roberts,"
   she joked.

   Empowering with Strategy and Training
   The training also included instruction in advanced first aid, a skill
   Jason Beaubien, NPR global health and development correspondent,
   learned the value of first hand.

   Shortly after attending a hostile environment training session in 2002,
   he departed for Zimbabwe and almost immediately found himself in a
   situation requiring his new skills.

   "I was just out on the street and a kid gets run over by a car and is
   bleeding profusely from his head. Immediately all this stuff that they
   had just trained us in came back," Beaubien said. "The kid was just
   lying there. It was like a movie. All these people were around, but no
   one was going to the body. I went over and applied pressure to the
   wound. In what felt like 15 â 20 minutes, the Zimbabwean medical
   response team showed up."

   He was thankful that he knew what to do. And that wasn't the last time.

   "The next night," Beaubien continued. "I get arrested in Zimbabwe and
   interrogated."

   Beaubien and another reporter were looking into a story about grain
   silos when they were arrested and accused of spying. They held them all
   day at a police station and after dark they came into the room with a
   notebook and wanted to know who it belonged to. It was Beaubien's.

   They took him to the police station, down a completely dark hallway and
   into a room with a chair in the middle. While riding in a taxi earlier
   in the trip, Beaubien's cab driver had said of president Mugabe,
   "either by guns or by god he'll be gone soon." Beaubien had scribbled
   it down and now the Zimbabwean police wanted to know who said it, but
   he wasn't going to give up that information.

   "The strategy they had given was to just not answer it. If they kept
   pushing I would say I want to talk to the U.S. consulate," he said.

   He used what's called the "gray man strategy." Something trainers had
   walked him through a few weeks before and the goal was to keep the
   interrogation from actually progressing.

   "You want to be the dullest guy in the room. You don't want to be
   interesting. You don't lie because if you lie you will spiral into more
   lies and it will be difficult to keep track of what's going on. Don't
   say anything that's going to incriminate yourself."

   Eventually, they let him go.

   "I was very thankful at that moment to have a plan that had come out of
   that training," he said. "It was just very empowering to have some sort
   of strategy to deal with that because before that I had been a general
   assignment reporter in Boston and now all of a sudden I'm in Zimbabwe
   in the middle of the night being interrogated."

   Situations like this are precisely the reason why NPR is taking steps
   to train journalists; this isn't what they were taught in college when
   preparing to enter this profession.

   "Most of us come into this as English majors or Philosophy majors. I
   mean we have no training in this stuff," Beaubien said. "Soldiers get
   all this training, but journalists have been just showing up for
   generations in war zones often without any understanding of how guns
   work, landmines work or grenades work."

   For these international correspondents, who are often the only NPR
   journalists in an area, there is one final benefit to the group
   training sessions: talking about shared experiences.

   "We all talked about how we got out of tricky situations," Kahn said.
   "The camaraderie was really great."
