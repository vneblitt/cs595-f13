About

   In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created TEDx, a program
   of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a
   TED-like experience.

   At our event, called TEDxHagueAcademy, TEDTalks video and live speakers
   will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.

   The TED conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
   individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
   This independent [39]TEDx event is operated under license from [40]TED
