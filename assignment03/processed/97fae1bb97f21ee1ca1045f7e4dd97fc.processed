   Published on Jul 12, 2013

   A NASA Mars Curiosity rover team member gives an update on developments
   and status of the planetary exploration mission. The Mars Science
   Laboratory spacecraft delivered Curiosity to its target area on Mars at
   1:31:45 a.m. EDT on Aug. 6, 2012 which includes the 13.8 minutes needed
   for confirmation of the touchdown to be radioed to Earth at the speed
   of light. The rover will conduct a nearly two-year prime mission to
   investigate whether the Gale Crater region of Mars ever offered
   conditions favorable for microbial life.
   Curiosity carries 10 science instruments with a total mass 15 times as
   large as the science payloads on NASA's Mars rovers Spirit and
   Opportunity. Some of the tools, such as a laser-firing instrument for
   checking rocks' elemental composition from a distance, are the first of
   their kind on Mars. Curiosity will use a drill and scoop, which are
   located at the end of its robotic arm, to gather soil and powdered
   samples of rock interiors, then sieve and parcel out these samples into
   the rover's analytical laboratory instruments.
