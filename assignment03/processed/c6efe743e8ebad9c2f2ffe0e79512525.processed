Is That Online Degree Really Worth Anything?

   Growth in technology has made it easier for more students to have
   access to online courses to fit higher education into their already
   busy lives. The flexibility of online courses makes it easy for
   students to attend class, complete assignments and get their degrees.

   But when you're not meeting with a professor face-to-face or attending
   classes on a campus, it can be hard to tell a legitimate online college
   from a fraudulent one. The Internet has made it easier for more and
   more of these "diploma mills" to spring up and take your money, while
   granting you a worthless degree.

   Diploma mills, so dubbed by the Department of Education, operate
   without supervision from a state or other professional organization.
   The degrees they grant are either fraudulent or completely worthless
   because of a lack of proper educational standards.

   The Better Business Bureau (BBB) suggests that consumers protect
   themselves from diploma mills by doing the proper research ahead of
   time. The BBB also suggests looking for these red flags to alert you to
   a fraudulent institution:
     * Degrees that can be earned in less time than at an accredited
       postsecondary institution, an example would be earning a Bachelor's
       degree in a few months.
     * Tuition paid on a per-degree basis, or discounts for enrolling in
       multiple degree programs. Accredited institutions charge by credit
       hours, course, or semester.
     * Little or no interaction with professors.
     * Names that are similar to well known reputable universities.
     * Addresses that are box numbers or suites. That campus may very well
       be a mail drop box or someone's attic.

   enroll in an online university.
