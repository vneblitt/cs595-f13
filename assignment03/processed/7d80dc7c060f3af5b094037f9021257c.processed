In D.C., bullets leave another child fatherless

David Robinson tried to escape the violence all around him. Instead he was
killed four months before the birth of his son.

   Published on September 15, 2013

   For 16 minutes, doctors in an emergency room treatment bay called
   Trauma 1 worked urgently to resuscitate the patient, a gunshot victim
   with no vital signs and a wound so grievous that saving him would have
   amounted to a resurrection.

   David Robinson's life had all but [26]officially ended even before an
   ambulance crew wheeled him into Howard University Hospital that winter
   morning in 2012. A bullet fired on a dark street in Northeast
   Washington had severed his aorta, and surgeon Wendy Ricketts Greene
   knew that nothing in medical science could bring him back. Glancing at
   the wall clock, she noted the time, 3:13 a.m., and pronounced the young
   man dead.

   Four of his loved ones soon hurried into Howard - four women in their
   40s, trembling and desperate to know his condition, among them his
   mother and godmother.

   Each had been jolted awake by a pre-dawn phone call as word spread from
   the crime scene at 58th and Foote streets: Some dude had a gun; Day-Day
   got shot. Waiting silently in an ER conference room, they clung to
   hope: David had been shot before and had pulled through. And lately,
   he'd been brimming with good intentions, promising he was done with the
   hazards of the `hood - with the beefs, the bullets, the burials.

   [27]GUNS IN AMERICA:

   This article is part of an occasional series examining the role of guns
   and the influence of the gun industry in the United States.

   He had a full-time job that he enjoyed and a deepening religious faith;
   he was close to earning a high school diploma and excited to be an
   expectant father.

   Then the doctor walked in, and from her solemn expression the women
   could see that a tragedy they'd long dreaded and tried to prevent had
   come to pass. "Unresponsive" is a word Evon Davis says she won't
   forget, the term Greene used to describe her son, dead on a gurney two
   months shy of his 20th birthday.

   After he barely survived being shot when he was 17, David Robinson
   began worshiping at Masjid Muhammad and reading the Koran. ‚Man, I need
   to believe in something,‚ he told one of his closest friends, Larry
   Reeves. ‚He said, ‚If I die, I have to have some type of belief.‚‚‚
   Above, Kyreem Robinson, now 16 months old, on the day that he took his
   first steps.

   His killing, still unsolved, is the story of [28]gun violence in
   Washington.

   Year after year, young black males make up the bulk of the slain, most
   of them shot in [29]poor or working-class neighborhoods, as David was.

   In 2012, more than [30]90 percent of the dead were African Americans
   and nearly seven in 10 were younger than 35. The city's [31]homicide
   rate has gone way down - the annual body count dropped from a record
   high of 482 in 1991 to a half-century low of 88 last year - but the
   casualties don't change. Like David, many of the fallen loitered in the
   danger zone, in the vicinity of the killers and the killed, always in
   the shadows of trouble.

   Victims who aren't perceived as innocent tend to draw scant public
   notice or sympathy, and the shooting of David Robinson appalled the
   civic conscience only briefly, owing to the dismal particulars of the
   crime: He had died in a gunfight after being robbed of his new Nike
   sneakers.

   "The circumstances are not only tragic, they are incredibly
   disquieting," Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) [32]said hours after the
   slaying as he appeared at a previously scheduled church vigil against
   violence."A life for a pair of Nike tennis shoes? C'mon, ladies and
   gentlemen! It's time for us to be able to end this tragic violence in
   our society."

   There was a pistol on the pavement near David when the police found him
   bleeding and unconscious. He carried a gun routinely, for
   self-protection, he used to say.

   "My best friend," he called his piece.

   It was how he lived. But he wanted a better way.

What roiled inside

   Robert ‚Pops‚ Brown, 78, attends the graveside memorial to mark the
   first one-year anniversary of the death of his grandson David Robinson.
   The baby being held at left, Kyreem, is David‚s son, who was born four
   months after he was killed shot.

   "R.I.P." is all over some neighborhoods - swirled in tattoos on young
   men's arms and chests, etched in sidewalk cement, spray-painted on
   walls and carved in courtyard benches: R.I.P. Sean, R.I.P. Anton,
   R.I.P. Tyrone, Cory, Rasheed, Fuzzy. . . . Rest in peace, gone too
   soon.

   Weeks after David's burial, after Evon's shock had given way to an
   unceasing dull ache, her daughter, Rejjina, a CVS clerk, came home one
   evening with a DVD titled "R.I.P. David L. Robinson." The two sat
   weeping in front of a TV, watching Day-Day's life flash by in 30
   minutes of video clips.

   The disc is a montage of joy and pain, of David as a child having fun
   and David as a teenager, his visage grim, after events had made him
   keenly aware of his mortality.

   Here was Day-Day in a chapel, gazing into the open coffin of his
   childhood friend Ashton Hunter (R.I.P. Duzzie), who had been shot while
   trying to buy a gun on the street. Hunter's funeral would be followed
   within minutes by a retaliation killing a few blocks from the mortuary.

   Here was the world David tried to escape.

   David Robinson had been trying to break free of the mayhem that defined
   his life in Shaw.

   shoes that cost him his life. (Michael S. Williamson)

   "All I ever wanted, the only thing I hoped for, was for him to grow up
   and be a person that can be respected," says Evon, 48, who used to
   preach to him, "You have much more potential than you realize."

   Evon raised David and Rejjina, born 11 months apart, in a housing
   complex named for a city that continues to evolve while nothing much
   changes about her life: Washington Apartments, it's called.

   She has lived there since 1978, first with her parents and four of her
   siblings, then in an apartment of her own. Except for intermittent
   stints as a hairstylist and a nursing assistant - eight years of work,
   long ago - Evon has been unemployed since finishing high school in
   1983, mainly for health reasons, she says. Through the years, she has
   managed to get by on public assistance and money earned from
   babysitting and styling friends' hair in her living room.

   Like many of her neighbors, Evon is a low-income holdover in
   gentrifying Shaw. It's a swath of the city transformed in the past
   decade by waves of monied newcomers, yet a community still blemished by
   poverty and crime, a reminder of the crack-fueled mayhem that ravaged
   the area a quarter-century ago.

   The DVD had been given to Rejjina by an amateur videographer named
   Curtis Mozie, then a counselor at Shaw's Kennedy Recreation Center.

   For 20-plus years, Mozie, nicknamed C-Webb, has chronicled the street
   lives of young people in poor parts of the District, coaxing them to
   talk on camera about their hopes and fears. So vast is his archive -
   gathered at playgrounds and go-go parties, at homicide scenes and
   funerals - that when a teenager is killed, there's a fair chance that
   the victim is someone C-Webb has recorded. And often he'll produce a
   rest-in-peace DVD for the bereaved family, a video eulogy like the one
   he created for Evon and Rejjina, layered with a soundtrack of 2Pac and
   Whitney Houston.

   "I was crying from beginning to end," says Evon, who watched the DVD
   just once, unable to bear it again.

   Here was Day-Day at age 10, laughing in a crowd of kids playing "beat
   your feet" on the corner of Seventh and O streets NW, busting hip-hop
   dance moves and yelling who's best. In those days, with his big
   eyeglasses, high cheeks and sweet disposition, he reminded folks of the
   nerdy TV character Steve Urkel.

Shooting back: C-Webb‚s crusade against gun violence

   [robinsonvideo.jpg&w=1500]

   Curtis Mozie, a.k.a. ‚C-Webb,‚ has been filming in D.C.‚s Shaw
   neighborhood since the 1980s, documenting inner city life. Mozie‚s
   footage of neighborhood kids growing up eventually became something
   different, serving as both memorials to those who died in street
   violence and a form of community journalism in its rawest form. (AJ
   Chavar/The Washington Post)

   And here he was at 12, boxing in the Kennedy Rec with his pint-size
   buddy Malik, the two flailing at each other, gleeful, as the referee
   tells C-Webb's camera, "Instead of shooting a gun and stabbing people,
   we put the gloves on and let `em go!"

   "So," said C-Webb to the boys after the bout, "y'all feel better now,
   using the boxing gloves instead of a gun?" Nodding, smiling, catching
   his breath, David replied, "Yeah."

   Watching the images through tears, Evon knew what roiled in her son
   back then, the anger and confusion stewing behind a youngster's big
   grin.

   He was a boy yearning for the father he was named after, David Lee
   Robinson, an auto mechanic with a 10th-grade education and a court
   record that would grow to list 17 arrests and four jail stints for
   assaults and other crimes. Big David would visit Day-Day and Rejjina,
   then vanish from their lives for weeks or months, says Evon, who met
   him when she was 25 and whose romance with him died of natural causes a
   couple of years later.

   People could tell from Day-Day's moods whether his father had spent
   time with him lately; they could tell from his exuberance in the
   afterglow of a daddy drop-by and from his growing surliness during his
   father's long absences, when Big David ignored the boy like a bad debt.

‚You could see the rage in him‚

   Evon Davis still mourns her son, who lived with her in Washington
   Apartments. Behind her are the sonograms of her grandson, Kyreem, who
   was born after his father‚s murder.

   David was a third-grader at Seaton Elementary when his misbehavior
   began to seriously worry Evon.

   "Getting in fights, talking back," his mother says. "He was angry about
   things. Nobody ever said it was about his father, but I figured it
   was."

   He wasn't yet 10 when two adults with kind intentions came into his
   life, each hoping to mentor him to a gainful future.

   One of them, Pastor Annette Miles, now 60, is a longtime hairstyling
   client and neighbor of Evon's in Washington Apartments. Pastor Annette
   runs an urban version of a country schoolhouse - two rooms in a Georgia
   Avenue NW storefront for about 60 well-behaved youngsters, K-to-12,
   neatly clad in uniforms. Students are obliged to be courteous and tidy
   at Academia De La Recta Porta, where the pastor also demands
   industriousness, good posture and precise diction.
   [pixel.png]

   Pastor Annette Miles, the dean at Academia De La Recta Porta, thought
   David Robinson would benefit from the private school's small size and
   strict rules. She urged his mother, Evon Davis, a longtime friend and
   neighbor, to enroll him there in third grade.

   "Embrace the proper protocols relative to etiquette and manners" is
   what she expects from children. Thinking her school's size and strict
   rules would benefit David - who struggled academically, slowed by a
   learning disability - she urged Evon to enroll him there as a
   third-grader, telling her to pay only as much tuition as she could
   afford.

   And there was Steve Titlebaum, then 32, a new volunteer with Big
   Brothers Big Sisters of the National Capital Area. Having settled her
   troubled son in Pastor Annette's academy, Evon saw an ad for Big
   Brothers and thought a worthy male role model might ease the boy's
   futile yearning for his father.

   "I think when I initially went into it, I was a little bit naive," says
   Titlebaum, a professional fundraiser for nonprofit groups who lives
   alone in Takoma Park and has no children. Remembering his time with
   David, he tends to cry.

   "I always talked about not succumbing to peer pressure, staying away
   from certain influences, staying out of trouble," he says. "But any
   child, as they get older, there's less and less you can do. It becomes
   his friends who have all the influence."

   The two were together almost every Saturday in the early years,
   visiting museums and ethnic restaurants. They hiked and picked apples
   and played problem-solving board games. Titlebaum urged David to focus
   his energy on school. "Growing up to live in an apartment similar to
   the one his mother lived in, right nearby, in the same place - that was
   how he envisioned life," Titlebaum recalls. "And I would always say to
   him, `David, if you work hard, you can go further, you can have more.'
   "

   It was in Evon's apartment, in 2004, that Titlebaum first encountered
   another man destined to impact Day-Day's life - a laborer named
   Maximillian Crawford.

   "There was something about him I didn't like," Titlebaum remembers.

   Crawford, then 36, was Evon's new boyfriend, a relationship born in an
   AOL chat room. Chatting had progressed to dating, Evon says, and soon
   Crawford was sleeping at her place three or four nights a week. "I was
   in love," she says.

   Steve Titlebaum, who was a volunteer with Big Brothers Big Sisters of
   the National Capital Area, mentored David Robinson for several years.
   In the beginning, the two were together almost every Saturday, visiting
   museums, hiking and going to restaurants.

   In all their chatting, Crawford had neglected to mention that he'd
   spent the 1990s in prison after admitting to sexually molesting a
   9-year-old niece. Evon says she heard about it from a neighbor, who saw
   Crawford's mug shot on the D.C. sex-offender registry. When she made
   delicate inquiries among adolescent girls who frequented her apartment,
   four of them said they'd been groped, or much worse, by her boyfriend.

   There was a major ruckus after that - Evon calling the police; Crawford
   going on the lam briefly; and a posse of irate men shooting 20 or 30
   holes in the clunker sedan he left behind. He was sentenced to 15 years
   in prison after pleading guilty to first-degree child sex abuse of one
   of the girls and attempted sex abuse of another.

   The Crawford mess profoundly upset 12-year-old David, his mother says.
   "He came in the house, saw all the police, saw all the people outside,
   and he was like, `Ma, what's going on?' " She explained it as well as
   she could. "I mean, he was just . . . " Evon pauses, her eyes shut. "I
   remember he went in the kitchen, yelling how he was going to kill him;
   got a knife, before we got it away from him; kept saying he was going
   to go find him, he was going to kill him."

   Afterward, David's father did some drive-by parenting, berating the
   seventh-grader for being derelict in his duties as "the man of the
   house." That was Big David's wisdom on the matter: If the boy had kept
   a closer eye on Crawford, the whole awful episode might have been
   prevented. Evon says she argued with Robinson, yelling: "You can't put
   that blame on a child! If you're going to blame anyone, blame me!"

   She says of her son: "You could see the rage in him. I mean, it really
   messed with David. His whole attitude and demeanor, everything
   changed." As a court-appointed psychologist later noted, David "felt
   pressure to prove himself, to show the world that he is tough enough to
   protect himself and his family." And in his anger - in his misguided
   quest to be a man - he turned to the treacherous streets.

   "Started hanging with all them other knuckleheads out there," Evon
   says, "with their guns and whatnot."

One neighborhood, two worlds

   Cranes swing high above the gentrifying streets of Shaw, the Northwest
   D.C. neighborhood where David Robinson grew up. The famed O Street
   Market is being rebuilt, along with high-end apartments and other new
   businesses.

   Countless young people living on the city's margins congregate on
   building stoops and street corners, intending no harm. They go to
   school; they have jobs. They aren't the "knuckleheads," as D.C. police
   use the term.

   In the knucklehead culture that Day-Day fell into, young street
   denizens belong to little clans - "crews," in cop parlance - each
   claiming a stretch of neighborhood turf. Among the mini-nations of
   Shaw, the Seventh and O crew and the Fifth and O crew have been locked
   in a Hatfields-and-McCoys-type beef for a generation. The feud erupts
   in spates of murderous, tit-for-tat gunfire, goes quiet for a while,
   then flares anew.

   Because Washington Apartments is in the Seventh and O realm, Day-Day
   became identified with that crew. But there's no membership roll, no
   initiation rites. It's a loose collection of street acquaintances, some
   of them varsity-level felons, some junior varsity, some just adolescent
   wannabe gangstas. They hang out, looking for trouble or waiting for
   trouble to find them, which, sooner or later, it usually does.

   David got the street pose down in no time - the sneer, the saunter, the
   don't nothin' matter air of sullen indifference.

   Amid his turbulent adolescence, the neighborhood was experiencing a
   dazzling rebirth, sparked by construction of the $850 million
   Washington Convention Center, which opened in 2003. Shaw's ugly
   memories from the 1968 riots and the late-'80s crack scourge, which had
   caused lasting devastation to the community, were being buried at last.

   ‚David . . . would not be ‚chumped.‚ His response would be threatening
   to ‚bust you up.‚‚

   --Pastor Annette

   Cranes swung high above the streets. Hotels, retail outlets, business
   offices and apartment buildings kept arriving as dilapidated
   storefronts and ramshackle rowhouses vanished. Over the past dozen
   years, census figures show, the median household income in the heart of
   Shaw has tripled to almost $70,000. Even the nature of crime has
   changed, with street robberies more common now than drug deals.

   Affluent young gentrifiers, well-educated and racially diverse, began
   moving into Washington Apartments, which had opened in 1977 as
   subsidized housing for low-income residents. Back then, tenants paid
   about 30 percent of their incomes each month and the U.S. Department of
   Housing and Urban Development took care of the rest.

   In 2007, the complex's owners began requiring new residents to pay
   market rates, while longtimers such as Evon remained in the federal
   subsidy program. Of the 262 apartments, 84 are still occupied by
   tenants with HUD vouchers.

   For Evon, who doesn't have an on-the-books job, and whose welfare
   eligibility ran out a few years ago, 30 percent of her documented
   income is zero. So that's what she contributes toward the rent for her
   three-bedroom apartment, which would cost a newcomer about $2,400 a
   month. "Don't pay nothing," she says.

   Evon mostly ignores her better-off neighbors, with their late-model
   cars, their big-ticket bicycles, their pricey jogging strollers. Shaw's
   renaissance has changed nothing about her reality. Nor did it help her
   son.

   The change in David, his new street ethos, worried Pastor Annette.
   "David would not stand for any disrespect or perceived disrespect from
   any of his male peers," she recalls. "He would not be `chumped.' His
   response would be threatening to `bust you up.' "

   By the eighth grade, she says, his disobedience was so flagrant that it
   was obvious to her and to his mother that he'd hadenough of her academy
   and its rules.

   "We talked it over," the pastor says. "Rather than lose him altogether
   and have him drop out, we thought, well, let's try public school. And
   we'd just hope for the best."

   On Aug. 28, 2006, David started the ninth grade at Shaw Junior High.

   Two weeks later, he was arrested for the first time, after some hallway
   shoving between groups of kids boiled over after school in a nearby
   7-Eleven parking lot.

   Alerted by a neighbor, Evon left her apartment and hustled up the block
   in time to see her son being led away in handcuffs, accused of pulling
   a gun.

   She glared at David, who eventually would be placed on probation. "Is
   this what you want for your life?" she hollered. "Is this what you
   want?"

   Evon remembers his weary expression, his air of defeat. "He was just
   looking at me with these sad eyes," she recalls. "And he didn't say
   anything."

   He was 14.

‚Whose gun was it?‚

   Evon Davis and her brother, Bernard Brown, mourn the death of Evon‚s
   son, David Robinson, a year after his death. Brown, who spent 18 years
   in prison for second-degree murder, warned his nephew about the perils
   of the streets in weekly phone calls.

   Of the many adults who tried to help young David, one was a hard-time
   penitentiary inmate, an uncle who counseled Day-Day by phone for years.

   In 1991, Bernard Brown, then 22, was beginning a sentence of 15 years
   to life for second-degree murder when he learned that his sister Evon
   was pregnant.

   "When she first told me, I was scared," recalls Bernard, who had been a
   pistol-packing dope dealer in Shaw. "I was like, `Yo, is you positive
   you want a child in that neighborhood, all the stuff they get into?' "

   "It ain't going to be like that," Evon remembers telling him by phone.
   "He ain't going to be like the rest of these kids out here."

   Bernard became a long-distance parent to a child he'd seen only in
   photos, talking with David weekly from about the time the boy was 6
   years old. "I'd call him up, and I'd be like: `Man, what's going on?
   How's school? . . . You being good?' "

   And starting when David was 10, his uncle made sure to caution him
   about the perils of the neighborhood.

   Then Bernard got word that Day-Day was hanging on the streets, and he
   warned his nephew again about the dangers. Yet nothing he said made a
   dent.

   On that September afternoon in 2006 when David was first arrested, it
   was Seventh and O vs. Fifth and O in the 7-Eleven parking lot, Evon
   thinks. Or maybe it was Ninth and O, not Fifth and O. David wasn't
   specific about that. He wasn't specific about a lot of things, with his
   mother or his uncle or his Big Brother, all of whom pressed him about
   where he got the gun. The code against snitching had become part of
   Day-Day's system of street principles by then, along with his credo of
   tolerating no disrespect.

   "For me," says Titlebaum, "it was really a swift kick in the butt to
   face reality, that this kid was living a totally different life than I
   lived."

   Five years into their relationship, the two had begun to drift apart,
   and eventually they would lose touch permanently. "I kept asking:
   `Whose gun was it? Who gave it to you?' " Titlebaum recalls. "I said,
   `Why don't you tell the police?' And he was like: `No, no, no. You
   don't do that.' "

   From prison, meanwhile, Bernard kept talking sense to Day-Day.

   "I told him, `Guns don't make you a man!' I told him, `Guns make you a
   coward!' And he was like, `Unc, man, I know, I know, but these dudes
   out here, they're carrying guns, talking about they're going to do
   this, they're going to do that.'

   "He was like, `Unc, it ain't safe out here.' "

Armed and afraid

   David Robinson showed amateur videographer Curtis ‚C-Webb‚ Mozie an
   eight-inch row of surgical staples after he barely survived a 2009
   shooting at a go-go concert. He told Mozie he wanted to change his
   life. ‚I need to do something, definitely,‚ he said.

   The first time Day-Day caught a bullet, he was in a gaggle of young
   people who got to fighting at a go-go concert at a Knights of Columbus
   hall in Oxon Hill.

   That May night in 2009, after bouncers showed the belligerents the
   door, the beef kept up on the driveway until the crack of gunfire put
   an end to the bravado.

   David, 17, groaned, clutching his belly as he spun and collapsed. The
   crowd scattered, knuckleheads fleeing in every direction, while one of
   David's companions cradled his gut-shot buddy on the ground. Just hours
   earlier, the two had been together at the funeral of a friend (R.I.P.
   Big Son) slain in one of Shaw's incessant crew beefs.

   At Washington Apartments, Evon got a phone call near midnight.

   As she would do again almost three years later, she hurried to an
   emergency room, unsure if her son was alive. At Prince George's
   Hospital Center, she waited for hours until a surgeon appeared and
   nodded reassuringly. David had pulled through, the doctor said,
   although the bullet had come close to putting him in a body bag.

   "It went in one side of his abdomen and exited out his back," Evon
   says. "It hit one of his kidneys. It hit some part of his intestines.
   It hit his stomach area. It was like it ricocheted through him." She
   remembers the doctor saying, "He's a very lucky young man."

   On his chest, above the scar, he would get a tattoo: "Blessed."

   Three rough years had passed since David's first arrest - three more
   years of David on the streets, of David enduring his mother's desperate
   pleas and lectures. He'd left a record of fistfights and suspensions,
   chronic absences and failing grades
   at three public high schools in 18 months. And he'd been arrested
   again, hauled from the passenger seat of a stolen car after it crashed
   during a police chase.

   Each arrest brought a stretch of juvenile probation. "Never mind the
   things they was doing out there that he didn't actually get caught
   for," Evon says, rolling her eyes.

   Amateur videographer Curtis ‚C-Webb‚ Mozie calls his work ‚Tale of the
   Tape,‚ a reference to the yellow police tape strung up at homicide
   scenes. He once asked David Robinson whether he thought he would become
   a ‚Tale of the Tape.‚

   In the months before the go-go shooting, Evon had poured out her heart
   to Pastor Annette, who had consoled her, saying: "Evon, David's going
   to be all right. God's just pinching him right now." Which had made
   Evon think: "Lord, I know Pastor Annette says you just pinching him
   right now. But I don't think you pinching him hard enough."

   As she sat with David in his hospital room, Evon half-wondered if the
   wound he had miraculously survived was a tough-love form of divine
   intervention, the Almighty just up and pulling the trigger on Day-Day
   to make an impression."I think it made everything real to him," she
   says, "like he finally realized all this craziness going on ain't for
   him."

   Here was Day-Day a few weeks later, fresh out of the hospital, standing
   in the Kennedy Rec with amateur videographer Curtis "C-Webb" Mozie. And
   here was C-Webb, chronicler of the streets, aiming his camera at David,
   inquiring about his near-demise. Their chat eventually would be
   featured on his R.I.P. tribute DVD.

   C-Webb, now 47, calls his work "Tale of the Tape," a reference to the
   yellow police ribbon strung up at homicide scenes. He asked Day-Day,
   "You ever thought about C-Webb, `Tale of the Tape' stuff, that you
   might be a story?"

   Day-Day, 5-foot-9 and slender with a thicket of untamed hair, lifted
   his jersey, revealing an eight-inch row of surgical staples running up
   his abdomen like a zipper. "Yeah," he replied, "I was thinking about
   that a lot" - thinking he ought to change his lifestyle before he
   landed permanently horizontal. "I need to do something, definitely."

   Which was easier imagined than done.

   "All he talked about was how afraid he was," says his uncle Bernard,
   who had been locked up for 18 years by then and was close to being
   paroled. "All he could think about was not being able to see his mom
   and sister no more."

   After the go-go shooting, David would rarely be without a pistol. A
   second juvenile arrest for gun possession, just weeks after his release
   from the hospital, and another round of probation would not dissuade
   him from packing a weapon.

   "My best friend," he would say, patting his waistband.

   A comfort gun. For personal safety.

‚I don‚t play in the streets‚

   Student support specialist Khayree Kornegay checks up on students in
   the hallway of Maya Angelou Public Charter School, the last school
   David Robinson attended before he was killed. Maya, as it is known, is
   a last resort for teens on the verge of dropping out.

   Besides scaring and scarring him, the slug in the gut moved David to
   ponder his existence. An older fellow in Shaw introduced him to Islam
   in 2009, and Day-Day took to reading the Koran.

   "That's when he cut off his dreads and got his Muslim outfit," his
   mother recalls.

   He wasn't a poseur; he didn't wear his thobe and kufi as a fashion
   statement. Worshipers at the Masjid Muhammad mosque say David found
   solace and meaning in the Islamic holy book and regularly attended
   Friday jummah prayers. "He was just like, `Man, I need to believe in
   something,' " one of his closest pals, Larry Reeves, remembers. "He
   said, `If I die, I have to have some type of belief.' "

   David's new faith was accompanied by a commitment to earn a diploma.

   By then, he was attending the Maya Angelou charter high school in far
   Northeast Washington, a place of last resort for teenagers on the verge
   of becoming dropouts. Evon had enrolled him there just weeks before the
   go-go shooting, and he returned in the fall of 2009 for his first full
   academic year. He delighted his mother by showing up for classes
   (usually) and obeying the rules (usually).

   When David occasionally misbehaved or skipped a class, he got fast
   attention from school psychologist Troy Waller and student support
   specialist Khayree Kornegay, a former special education teacher.

   "In his soul, he wasn't really a tough guy," recalls Kornegay, now 51,
   explaining why he and Waller saw "a lot of potential" in Day-Day. "He
   wasn't no straight-out thug. He had a heart that wanted to help people,
   that genuinely cared for people."
   [pixel.png]

   In the last week of David‚s life, Troy Waller, left, a school
   psychologist at Maya Angelou, took him to sign up for the last two
   classes he needed to graduate from high school: English IV and biology.
   Khayree Kornegay, a student support specialist at Maya Angelou, saw a
   lot of potential in David Robinson: ‚In his soul, he wasn‚t really a
   tough guy. He had a heart that wanted to help people.‚

   Kornegay and Waller knew the weight of the baggage David carried from
   his childhood. They knew he felt compelled to prove he was a man. And
   they knew he clung to the dangerous notion that a real man won't
   tolerate being "punked."

   Kornegay, who worshiped with David at Masjid Muhammad, says, "His
   famous line was: `Korn, tell that boy he needs to check my r√©sum√© - I
   don't play in the streets.' " And in those moments of anger, Korn would
   calm him, coaxing David to rise above pointless aggression, to "stay on
   your deen," the path to righteousness in Islam.

   "Once he got here, he tried to leave that street stuff behind," Waller,
   now 39, remembers. "He really wanted to. He was working on it. But it's
   difficult to break those ties."

   What finally pushed him permanently from the streets was a `hood drama
   that began unfolding seven months after he was shot. It started with a
   robbery that landed David and another teenager in jail and led to
   gossip that Day-Day was a snitch.

   In the Dec. 15, 2009, stickup, a young man selling a pair of Nikes on a
   Capitol Heights street corner was relieved of the sneakers at gunpoint.
   David and his pal Dalontray Williams, nicknamed Apple, were the alleged
   perps. Apple was arrested by a Prince George's police officer after a
   foot chase that day. David eluded capture and hurried home to Shaw,
   conflicted over what to do next.

   As usual in dicey situations, he turned for advice to his street-savvy
   godmother, Brenda Mayo, a neighbor of Evon's and her closest friend
   since before David was born.

   Day-Day swore that he hadn't known the robbery was going to occur until
   Apple suddenly pulled a gun. He told Brenda that he suspected the
   police knew his name. He was worried he would seem guilty if he waited
   to be arrested, he said. Yet if he gave himself up, Brenda remembers
   him saying tearfully, "Guys out here are going to think I'm sucker!
   They're going to call me a punk!"

   At his godmother's urging, David surrendered, joining Apple behind
   bars, until the victim decided not to testify and the robbery charges
   were thrown out.

   When Apple got back to Shaw in early 2010, he began whispering to folks
   that Day-Day had implicated him in the holdup - that Day-Day was a rat.
   Which instantly made David persona non grata to the Seventh Street crew
   and put his life in danger.

   Apple isn't around now to explain his accusation: R.I.P. Apple, stabbed
   in a fight outside a dollar store in Shaw last year.

   "Day-Day wasn't no snitch," insists his friend Larry Reeves. "Day-Day
   could have brought this whole `hood down if he was snitching."

   Yet the allegation changed his life. In the places where he used to
   hang out, where he used to find trouble, he was no longer welcome.

   So he stopped hanging out. And he stopped finding trouble.

   "He knew he was better off," says Evon.

Getting distance from the ‚hood

   David Robinson‚s godbrother, Jamar Crawford, left, with his son Andre,
   8, look out over a courtyard at Washington Apartments, where both young
   men grew up. David tried to escape the gravity pull of Shaw‚s streets,
   but couldn't.

   Still, he was afraid, because he had that label: snitch.

   "I was real scared for him," says his uncle Bernard, a parolee by then,
   living in Prince George's. "Little guys killing dudes over that label."

   So Day-Day held onto his pistol. And he kept an eye out over his
   shoulder.

   "Sometimes I just want to know how it feels not to feel scared," he
   told his godmother, who pleaded with him repeatedly to stop carrying a
   gun.

   Then, on Christmas Eve 2010, David crossed paths with a Seventh Street
   miscreant who waved a knife at him - and he decided he'd had enough of
   Shaw. Only by putting distance between himself and the `hood could he
   escape the pull of the streets. A few weeks later, with Evon's
   blessing, David decamped to his aunt Linda Brown's brick-front colonial
   on a tree-shaded cul-de-sac in Glenmont, leaving the blare of city
   sirens for the chirp of crickets. It was a respite and a revelation.

   "I think he really enjoyed the quiet once he got used to it," Linda
   says.

   Commuting to Maya would have been impractical, so he left the school,
   hoping to attend Montgomery County's John F. Kennedy High. But
   complications involving his legal residency and tangled academic
   history kept preventing his enrollment.

   While his aunt tried to sort out matters with the Montgomery school
   system, David worked full time at the Home Depot in Northeast
   Washington.

   "He liked flooring," says Evon, remembering how proud David was of the
   Homer Award he received for customer service. "He'd come home and tell
   us all about tiles and this, that and the other." And he promised his
   mother that he would get his diploma, that she would see him "walk
   across that stage," that she would "get to scream and holler like
   everyone else."
   [pixel.png]

   David Robinson's room was left untouched for months after he was
   killed. His mother, Evon Davis, used to preach to him, ‚You have much
   more potential than you realize.‚ The shoe rack in David Robinson‚s
   bedroom is missing the pair of Nike Zoom Rookies that were stolen from
   him on the night that he died.

   He felt he owed it to Evon for sticking by him. His dad, on the other
   hand, had been mostly MIA. Nevertheless, David was heartbroken when
   Robinson, 53, succumbed to an AIDS-related illness on April 22, 2011.
   Big David had been living in an auto-repair garage he rented on a
   junk-strewn lot in Hyattsville, and there he died, alone on his bunk in
   a dingy storage room.

   His only possession of value was an old canary-yellow dragster dubbed
   Tweety Bird, worth $6,000. He left instructions for it to be sold and
   for the money to be given to a longtime girlfriend.

   "Like a week later, David and Rejjina went over to the garage," Evon
   recalls. "They just wanted to find something to remember him by. . . .
   There wasn't nothing there for them. They wanted something so bad, they
   brought home a broken fan."

   Kennedy High never happened for David; his aunt couldn't persuade the
   school to accept him. "David wanted to stay out here, he really did,"
   says Raynesha Brown, one of Linda's daughters. "But he was definitely
   all about school. . . . He wanted that diploma."

   In the summer of 2011, he reluctantly moved back to Evon's place, back
   to Shaw and all its hazards, figuring he would re-enroll at Maya. In
   the courtyard outside her apartment that July, he met the woman who
   would become the mother of his baby.

   Jamisha Houston was 23 then, a Starbucks barista rooming with a
   co-worker in Washington Apartments. "You know how boys be chasing
   girls, like, `Oh, I'm going to get you!' And he did," she recalls. "He
   got me." Jamisha, who already had two toddlers, soon found out she was
   pregnant, and 19-year-old Day-Day was elated.

   "He couldn't wait to have a child," Jamisha says. He planned to take
   night courses for a diploma while working full time at Home Depot. He
   vowed to immerse himself in his son's life, to be the kind of father
   Big David never was. He and Jamisha agreed that the boy would live with
   David in Evon's apartment until David graduated from high school. Then
   Day-Day would get a place of his own and devote his life to his child.

   Father and son, together in Washington Apartments.

   It wasn't long afterward that his godmother rewarded David for all the
   progress he was making, for his growing sense of purpose. Brenda handed
   him $220 to buy the new Nike sneakers he'd been pining for - a
   just-issued pair of Zoom Rookies, white over black. Three days before
   Christmas 2011, Day-Day crossed the parking lot of the Brentwood
   Shopping Center from Home Depot to a Foot Locker. He laid down the cash
   and went home smiling with his kicks.

‚Give up the Helly!‚

   Shaw, where David Robinson grew up, is increasingly affluent. At a bus
   stop across from the Washington Convention Center, the face reflected
   in the glass shelter is from an ad promoting mortgage help for
   low-income home buyers.

   In the final week of his life, David and Jamisha visited an OB-GYN and
   watched a three-dimensional sonogram of their unborn child.

   "You should have seen him," Jamisha says of David. "His eyes getting
   all watery and stuff."

   The same day, Troy Waller, the Maya psychologist who had mentored
   David, drove him to Roosevelt High and helped him register for two
   evening classes, English IV and biology, the last credits he needed for
   a diploma. In the car, Waller noticed Day-Day's spiffy footwear. "He
   was proud of the shoes. And we sort of laughed at the fact that he was
   trying to get me to buy him lunch. I said: `C'mon, man! You got
   yourself some nice new sneakers. You can pay for the McDonald's!' "

   Day-Day wore the Zooms to a party in Northeast Washington a few nights
   later. Afterward, he and his cousin Tim Brown, who was clad in a
   pricey¬ [34]Helly Hansen ski jacket,¬ were waiting for a Metro bus at
   Foote and 58th streets,¬ [35]in the Capitol View neighborhood, when a
   sport-utility vehicle eased past them. In the pre-dawn stillness, the
   SUV turned a corner, vanishing from view, then doubled back around

   Tim, sensing danger, knew Day-Day packed a piece. "Get that junt
   ready," he remembers saying to his cousin. It was 2:30 a.m. Sunday,
   Jan. 8, 2012. The SUV, bearing three or four knuckleheads, came to a
   stop, and one of them got out, aiming a gun.

   The corner of 58th and Foote streets in Northeast D.C. where
   19-year-old David Robinson and his cousin were waiting for a bus when
   the deadly robbery occurred. The cousin escaped, but David did not.

   "Give up the Helly!"

   Tim bolted, escaping in the dark with his fashionable winter coat.
   David, who stayed put, gave up his Nikes. And it should have ended with
   that, his family says. Except Day-Day would not be chumped; he would
   not be punked. Day-Day, who used to warn, "Check my r√©sum√©" and "I
   don't play in the streets," evidently drew the comfort gun he carried
   for personal safety and traded shots with the dude who stole his
   sneakers.

   "Having a gun can save you or kill you," says Brenda Mayo's son, Jamar.
   "In this case, I think it killed him. I think him having that gun is
   the reason he's gone."

   One bullet hit him. It went in near his left armpit and sliced the
   artery carrying blood from his heart; it pierced both of his lungs,
   fractured two ribs and came out near his right armpit before entering
   and lodging in his upper right arm, just beneath another of his
   tattoos, "R.I.P Bill-Bill," in memory of a slain friend.

   The mystery crew rode off, leaving him bleeding on the pavement.

   Today, the dog-eared case file labeled ROBINSON DAVID is 20 months old
   and two inches thick. It sits on Bob Alder's desk in the squad room of
   the D.C. police homicide unit, unsolved and going cold. "We're carrying
   the motive as robbery," Lt. Alder says, riffling the pages. "Pair of
   Nike sneakers."

   ROBINSON DAVID is the story of gun violence in Washington.

   He owned those Nikes for 17 days before somebody shot him. Yet robbery
   wasn't the only reason he died, his loved ones say. He died because of
   the way he'd lived, because of the fear he felt and what he'd learned
   about manhood as a boy on the streets of Shaw.

   "I truly wish I'd proceeded to do more about this gun he carried
   around," his godmother, now 49, whispers in anguish. "Sometimes I pray
   to God to forgive me for that."

   Down a hall in Evon's apartment is Day-Day's bedroom. There's the old
   futon he slept on. There's the closet where he hid his various guns in
   a shoe box. There, on a wooden rack, are four pairs of his Nikes, but
   not the Zoom Rookies, his reward for seeking a future where futures are
   elusive.
   [pixel.png]

   David Robinson had worn a new pair of $220 Zoom Nikes like these for 17
   days before he was shot on Jan. 8, 2012. His assailants, who robbed and
   then killed him, have not been found.

   And there's his son, in a strip of sonogram images taped to the wall
   above a television.

   Kyreem Dawoud Robinson is 16 months old now, squirming on Evon's lap
   one afternoon in the dim light of her living room.

   "He has David's eyes," she says as Ky, in need of nap, bawls and
   fidgets. "He's like the sweetest little baby when he ain't sleepy. So I
   see a lot of David in him."

   Another generation, the fourth, in Washington Apartments.

   While Jamisha works and cares for her two other sons in Southwest
   Washington, Ky stays with Evon four days a week. The boy, his hair in
   cornrows, finds the pacifier clipped to his jersey and falls silent,
   burying his face in his grandmother's bosom.

   She worries, as her brother Bernard used to fret when Evon was
   pregnant:

   Yo, is you positive you want a child in that neighborhood?

   By the time her grandson is 4 or 5 years old, if gentrification hasn't
   rid Shaw of its knucklehead culture, Evon says, "I would think about
   moving. Because I don't want to go down the same road, you know?"

   A boy missing his father, turning to the streets.

   It ain't going to be like that. He ain't going to be like these other
   kids out here.

   "This is a second chance," Evon says, in a tone of self-persuasion.
   "Maybe the mistakes I made with my kids, I can change them with him. Or
   at least try."
