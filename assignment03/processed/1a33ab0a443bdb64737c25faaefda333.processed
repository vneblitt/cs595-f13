   Science Update o September 5, 2013

   About one million people worldwide die annually by [74]suicide--there
   is one death by suicide every 40 seconds. The number of lives lost each
   year through suicide exceeds the number of deaths due to homicide and
   war combined. Despite these daunting numbers, suicide is one of the
   most preventable health problems.

   In honor of [75]World Suicide Prevention Day, the National Institute of
   Mental Health (NIMH) will host a Twitter chat with Lisa Horowitz,
   Ph.D., M.P.H., on September 10, 2013, from 2-3 pm ET. Dr. Horowitz is a
   senior clinician on the Psychiatric Consultation-Liaison Service in
   NIMH's Office of the Clinical Director. She recently developed a
   [76]suicide screening tool that emergency department doctors and nurses
   can use to detect youth at risk for attempting suicide.

   A [77]Twitter chat is an organized event where people participate in an
   interactive conversation through tweets. The conversation usually
   focuses on a pre-arranged topic and specific tag (#) called a hashtag.
   Hashtags allow the conversation to be easily followed on Twitter. The
   chats are scheduled for a specific time and date, but are archived on
   this web page for viewing anytime. To participate, you will need a
   Twitter handle and account. If you prefer to simply observe the chat
   taking place, you may enter the specified hashtag at [78]twubs.com to
   view the conversation in real-time. Email us at [79]NIMHpress@nih.gov
   if you have questions...and we'll see you at our next Twitter chat!

   You can find this discussion under [80]#NIMHchats. An archive of the
   chat will be posted shortly after the event.
