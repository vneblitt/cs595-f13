   Chicago Tribune reporter Adam Sege recaps the night's crime, including
   a South Side gas station shooting, and the killing of a 21-year-old man
   in Evanston. (Posted on: September 11, 2013)
   Staff report

   11:44 a.m. CDT, September 11, 2013
   A 21-year-old man was fatally shot outside his home about a block from
   the campus of Evanston Township High School, police said.
   Cardereon Preister was leaning against a car when he was shot outside
   his home in the 1700 block of Leland Avenue around 11 p.m. Tuesday,
   authorities said.

     * [129]A 21-year-old man was fatally shot on Leland Avenue in
       Evanston late Tuesday night. [130]A 21-year-old man was fatally
       shot on Leland Avenue in Evanston late Tuesday night.

   "Somebody fired a single shot which struck him in the upper torso,
   shoulder area,'' said Evanston Police Commander Jay Parrott.
   Responding officers found Preister lying face down on the street. He
   was taken to Evanston Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 11:25
   p.m.
   Parrott said police had no description of the gunman but were looking
   into whether his criminal background was connected to the shooting.
   "It's hard to say at this point. He was definitely in a circle of
   individuals that were problematic to the area and his criminal
   background was problematic,'' Parrott said."It's being looked at.
   "He has several arrests with us and he was currently on parole for
   burglary and for delivery of cannabis,'' Parrott said. "His history is
   basically drugs and burglary.''
   Preister's home is about two blocks from the high school and a block
   from the school's athletic field.
   Parrott said anyone with information can call police at (847) 866-5000.
