   Scammers have been making phone calls claiming to represent the
   National Do Not Call Registry. The calls claim to provide an
   opportunity to sign up for the Registry. These calls are not coming
   from the Registry or the Federal Trade Commission, and you should not
   respond to these calls. To add your number to the Registry you can call
   888-382-1222 from the phone you wish to register, or go click on
   ‚Register a Phone Number‚ in the left column of this page.
   Your registration will not expire. Telephone numbers placed on the
   National Do Not Call Registry will remain on it permanently due to the
   Do-Not-Call Improvement Act of 2007, which became law in February 2008.
