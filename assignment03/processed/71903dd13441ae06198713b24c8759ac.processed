O'Connor questions court's decision to take Bush v. Gore

In interview at Tribune, retired justice also calls for merit selection of
judges

   Retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor hasn't given
   much thought to which was the most important case she helped decide
   during her 25 years on the bench. But she has no doubt which was the
   most controversial.

   It was Bush v. Gore, which ended the Florida recount and decided the
   2000 presidential election.

   Looking back, O'Connor said, she isn't sure the high court should have
   taken the case.

   "It took the case and decided it at a time when it was still a big
   election issue," O'Connor said during a talk Friday with the Tribune
   editorial board. "Maybe the court should have said, 'We're not going to
   take it, goodbye.'"

   The case, she said, "stirred up the public" and "gave the court a
   less-than-perfect reputation."

   "Obviously the court did reach a decision and thought it had to reach a
   decision," she said. "It turned out the election authorities in Florida
   hadn't done a real good job there and kind of messed it up. And
   probably the Supreme Court added to the problem at the end of the day."

   O'Connor, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, was the
   first woman to serve on the high court. Though she tended to side with
   the conservatives, O'Connor was known as the court's swing vote. Her
   vote in the 5-4 Bush v. Gore decision effectively gave Republican
   George W. Bush a victory over his Democratic opponent, then-Vice
   President Al Gore.

   O'Connor, 83, said that while other members of the court never
   personally lobbied for her vote, they did try to persuade her by
   including points in their written arguments that they believed she
   would support. Sometimes, she said, they were successful.

   In a wide-ranging interview, O'Connor also voiced her support for doing
   away with judicial elections -- such as those in Illinois -- in favor
   of merit selection, in which candidates are recommended by a citizen
   advisory group and submitted to a state's governor for appointment to
   the courts. Illinois politicians have rejected the idea.

   O'Connor was in Chicago to promote one of her pet projects, iCivics, an
   online curriculum set up in a video game format. While most school
   systems, including those in Illinois, don't require students to pass a
   civics exam to graduate, O'Connor said introducing the subject to
   children in the classroom could increase their participation in the
   election process as adults.

   O'Connor, who said she had difficulty landing her first job as a lawyer
   because she was a woman, applauded the advances women have made in the
   field. She retired in 2006, but O'Connor said she still enjoys going to
   the court and listening to oral arguments when she's in Washington. And
   she reads the briefs once the decision comes down.

   "When I go and sit in the courtroom and look at the bench and see three
   women, it perks me up," she said.
