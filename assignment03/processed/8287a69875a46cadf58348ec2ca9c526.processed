   Governor Christie: Damn, boardwalks are opening all over New Jersey.
   I'm going to try to be at everyone of them over the course of the next
   five or six days. We were in Lavallette earlier this week, Asbury Park
   officially reopened this past Saturday, I'll be in Point Pleasant and
   Seaside Heights, we'll be in Wildwood and Ocean City, we'll be in
   Bradley Beach, we'll be all across the Jersey Shore over the course of
   the next five days. And the biggest reason that why I want to come and
   open these boardwalks is because I want New Jersey, and the region, and
   the Country to know that New Jersey has come back, that the summer will
   happen here in New Jersey and you need to bring your families here to
   enjoy and create new memories this summer, the summer of 2013 in New
   Jersey. That's what we're going to be talking about over the next five
   days and all summer in this state. We have a lot of challenges left to
   go and the folks who spoke before me have touched on all of them so I
   won't repeat them. I just want to tell you this, that on October 29th,
   I thought I had the greatest job in America. Being the Governor of the
   State that I was born and raised, I couldn't think of a better job than
   that. On October 30th it no longer was a job, it became a mission. And
   for any of you in your life who have been fortunate enough to have a
   mission, you know the difference. A job is important, a mission is
   sacred. And I know that the folks standing behind me feel exactly the
   same way. I will not let anyone get in between me and the completion of
   this mission to restore New Jersey to better than it was before October
   29th, to help the citizens of our state recover, and to make sure that
   we not only rebuild our infrastructure and our homes and our
   businesses, but we help them rebuild the lives that were lost and
   tattered on October 29th. The only way that we're going to do that is
   together, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, people at the Jersey
   Shore, people in Bergen, in Middlesex Counties, people in counties that
   weren't as affected, and folks who really believe this state is what
   it's always been, the strongest, toughest state in America. We're going
   to work together to do it. So mayor let's go over with the Senator and
   the Freeholder Director let's cut that ribbon and let's get this baby
   open. Thank you all very much.
