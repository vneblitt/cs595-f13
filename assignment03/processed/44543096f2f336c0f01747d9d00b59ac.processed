Saving Pulp Fiction

   September 5, 2013 by [14]Erin Allen

   (The following is a story written by Lindsey Hobbs of the Library's
   Preservation Directorate for the Library of Congress staff newsletter,
   The Gazette.)

   Pulp-fiction authors created some of the most enduring characters of
   any literary genre including Tarzan, detective Sam Spade, and the
   sword-wielding Zorro.

   The magazines that illustrated their exploits, unfortunately, haven‚t
   fared as well. In fact, they never were built to last ‚ the pulps were
   printed on cheap, wood-pulp paper (hence the name ‚pulp fiction),‚
   which quickly became brittle and acidic.

   Technicians in the Preservation Directorate, however, are working to
   give new life to the lustrous, eye-catching covers in the Library of
   Congress‚s sprawling collection of pulp-fiction magazines. The Serial
   and Government Publications Division holds roughly 14,000 issues from
   more than 300 titles published in the United States between the 1920s
   and 1950s.

     ‚American popular culture is an ever-expanding scholarly field, and
     the pulp magazines were a publication type that was popularized in
     America,‚ said Georgia Higley, head of the Newspaper Section in the
     Serials Division. ‚Anyone studying magazine history considers the
     covers important primary sources.‚

   The Library transferred most of the pulp serials to microfilm years ago
   because of the rapidly deteriorating wood-pulp paper. It was
   immediately apparent, however, that the color limitations of microfilm
   diminished the vibrant graphics.

     ‚Since even the best microfilming efforts do not adequately
     reproduce illustrative material, especially color images, the pulp
     magazine cover collection preserves an aspect of the original that
     would otherwise be lost to researchers here at LC,‚ Higley said.

   As a result, the Collections Conservation Section is conserving the
   original covers, and the Preservation Reformatting Division oversaw the
   creation of preservation facsimiles of much of the remaining text.

   Pulp-fiction serials rose to popularity primarily in the first half of
   the 20th century, as new technology permitted cheap, mass production
   and a more literate working class sought new sources of entertainment.

   Not known as purveyors of good taste, the pulps covered everything from
   romance and adventure to westerns and detective stories to horror and
   science fiction.

   The racier versions, known as ‚spicy‚ pulps, most often featured a
   scantily clad damsel in distress on the cover. Although the spicy pulps
   enjoyed wide popularity in their day, none occupy the Library‚s shelves
   ‚ they were deemed unsuitable for collection at the time.

   The striking cover art, which was at its most whimsical on the sci-fi
   and fantasy pulps, was a key factor in marketing and even story
   development.

   Often, artists created a cover that would lure readers at newsstands,
   and writers then would develop stories around the illustrated theme.

   Some artists made careers working exclusively for pulp magazines
   ‚¬ Margaret Brundage created dozens of covers for ‚Weird Tales,‚ widely
   considered the greatest of the horror and fantasy pulps.

   This issue of Startling Stories featured works by Philip K. Dick, whose
   later novels served as the basis for films such as ‚Blade Runner‚ and
   ‚Total Recall,‚ and Richard Matheson, whose novel ‚I am Legend‚ has
   been adapted for the screen three times. Serials and Government
   Publications Division.

   In addition to the glossy covers, pulp magazines also are notable for
   the many now-famous authors who got their start writing stories for as
   little as a third of a penny per word ‚ Ray Bradbury, Dashiell Hammett,
   H.P. Lovecraft, Isaac Asimov, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Raymond Chandler.
   Even a young L. Ron Hubbard became a star pulp writer before publishing
   his pre-Scientology treatise ‚Dianetics‚ in the pulp magazine
   ‚Astounding.‚

   Conspicuously absent from the list are any widely recognized female
   authors. Women pulp writers often used pseudonyms or disguised their
   first names by only using their initials.

   Mary Elizabeth Counselman, for example, wrote stories for ‚Weird
   Tales,‚ and Dorothy McIlwraith served as editor of both ‚Weird Tales‚
   and ‚Short Stories‚ for more than three decades. Leigh Brackett wrote
   science fiction as well as hard-boiled detective stories and went on to
   write novels and screenplays, including the script for George Lucas‚
   ‚The Empire Strikes Back.‚

   Since a large number of the serials still are in copyright,
   digitization is not yet an option.

   For now, Collections Conservation technicians are performing many
   tedious hours of paper repair and rusty staple removal, as well as
   creating a custom protective enclosure for each cover. Once the project
   is completed, CCS will have conserved more than 600 individual covers,
   which will return to the vault of the Serials Division in a condition
   suitable for handling by researchers.

   The pulp-fiction era came to an end in the 1950s with the rise of the
   paperback novel and television, but the magazines continue to serve as
   a unique resource of pop-culture history.

   The conservation work will allow researchers a more authentic and,
   likely, a more enjoyable experience.

     Said Higley: ‚We‚ll be able to offer researchers the chance to
     re-create the experience people had reading them.‚

       For more information on pulp fiction, there is Ron Goulart's
       informal survey of the genre: "Cheap Thrills" (1972).

       I am glad that these treasures are being preserved. Who doesn't
       love Sam Spade and Tarzan. It looks like pulp fiction is the cousin
       to comic books.

       Thank you for your amazing work and respect for storytelling of all
       kinds. While I regret that digitization does not provide an easy
       option to preserve the work, I honor the LOC for its respect for
       copyright and wish others followed your shining example.
       Congratulations and wishing you every success.

       Worthy work being done here to preserve some of the greatest, most
       enjoyable fiction you'll ever read. Pulp is back today with new
       stories being written by myself and many, many others featuring the
       classic characters in these old, precious magazines and new
       characters cut from the same cloth. We call it New Pulp and it's
       thriving. Also, many publishers are collecting the original tales
       in quality reprints so if anyone is curious about experiencing this
       great writing, check out outfits like Airship 27, Pro Se Press,
       Altus Press... They've all got what you're looking for. Fun times
       await. This fiction must be preserved!

       This is wonderful news! When I was working on my dissertation more
       than a decade ago, I was dismayed to learn that the LOC had
       discarded copies of True Story, True Confessions, and other pulp
       titles. Even the publishers that were still in print didn't have
       back copies of their own works. It was assumed that they didn't
       have lasting value.
       Thank for your your preservation efforts in this area.

       Speaking as someone who actually does research print culture
       (especially 19th/early 20th century Japan and the US), the claim
       that "[t]he conservation work will allow researchers a more
       authentic and, likely, a more enjoyable experience" is at best
       laughable and at worst, incredibly disconcerting. Because I have
       said this in numerous venues, I'll feel free to repeat it here: you
       CANNOT anticipate how a researcher is likely to use materials
       stored in a collection. Case in point: a researcher who was able to
       determine the air quality of medieval Europe solely from the
       chemical composition of paper in contemporary books. This had
       nothing to do with the text or visual appearance of the objects and
       everything to do with maintaining them in an unaltered form.
       Therefore a bare minimum of intervention (ideally none at all
       beyond minimizing environmental impact) should be considered best
       practice, even if that means keeping them in a brittle state.
       Moreover, given how research into print, both mass market and
       amateur, has emphasized contextualization of late, it shocks me to
       think that you rather cheerily believe breaking these objects up
       and encasing the covers re-creates "the experience people had
       reading them," when, in fact, it does anything but. The decision
       seems to have already been made, but don't try to pretend that this
       is even remotely to the benefit of someone such as myself or my
       colleagues.

       I have never read any pulp fictions. They look like they would be
       neat to read, especially for people who are into fiction! I have
       seen the movie Tarzan before and it was nice! I would like to read
       more!!! :)

       This is an important part of our literary heritage. Authors, such
       as Louis Lamour, started out in the pulps. These magazines desaerve
       conservation as a part of our literature.

       You wrote: "Since a large number of the serials still are in
       copyright, digitization is not yet an option."
       The upcoming wrapup of the Google scanning case may establish a
       Fair Use for reference libraries (such as LoC, eh?) to scan serials
       such as this in order to preserve them.
       Rights to many of these are now owned by individuals, who can be
       approached for permission to scan preservation copies. I'm thinking
       of Popular's titles; special magazines such as WEIRD TALES; and
       others.
       Conde Nast, owner of the Street and Smith copyrights, has an active
       licensing program, with many issues available as reprints from a
       third-party publisher. They're probably currently depositing
       copyright instances.
       Finally, for heaven's sake, you're the LC. You're the archive of
       record. II can't imagine anyone refusing to let you scan your rare
       items, someone who'd rather see his copyrights become meaningless
       as the last known copy disintegrates into pulp dust.

       It is so good to hear that serious attention is being paid to the
       preservation of this material. I first began reading "pulp" around
       1940, and it was always a great feeling, when I finished my
       homework, to curl up with one or another of the various genres of
       the pulps that clogged the newsstand displays.
       Mystery, War, and Sci-fi...reading was an adventure to us, far more
       exciting than some of what was served up by our 4th and 5th grade
       teachers!!
       Like the silent era cinema, this form of material was always
       accessible, and for a dime, no better bargain around. Which never
       stopped us from eventually graduating to what became the classic
       literature of the period
       This material is a doorway into the mind of the era, a part of the
       historical record. It is not a dusty subject for only the
       historian/researcher...and deserves to be made readily available to
       the public at large.
       If only the LOC could sell reprints of these and silent films
       through your bookshop....

       Not that I've ever seen the movie Pulp Fiction, at least I now
       understand what the meaning pulp fiction actually means. Thanks for
       sharing such interesting historical facts like that.

       It's great that these magazines are being preserved. In response to
       Mr. Thiesen's comments above, as someone who has worked in
       preservation, it's essential that materials like this are
       reformatted in some way in order for researchers to have access to
       them at all. As the article points out, these were printed on the
       lowest quality paper and as a result are far too delicate to be
       handled by researchers without completely disintegrating. Short of
       stopping time or storing them in an oxygen-free environment,
       they're going to fall apart. Let's keep a little perspective here
       -- while these are great pop culture resources and have historical
       importance, we're not talking about the Magna Carta. There's
       certainly no shortage of examples of paper materials from the early
       twentieth century. In fact, most libraries are swimming in it. I'm
       glad to see that these are getting some attention and researchers
       will actually be able to use them.
