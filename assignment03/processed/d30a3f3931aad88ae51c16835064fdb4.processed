   You see the ads in newspapers, on TV, and online. You hear them on the
   radio. You get fliers in the mail, email messages, and maybe even calls
   offering credit repair services. They all make the same claims:

   "Credit problems? No problem!"

   "We can remove bankruptcies, judgments, liens, and bad loans from your
   credit file forever!"

   "We can erase your bad credit -- 100% guaranteed."

   "Create a new credit identity -- legally."

   Do yourself a favor and save some money, too. Don't believe these
   claims: they're very likely [16]signs of a scam. Indeed, attorneys at
   the Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency,
   say they've never seen a legitimate credit repair operation making
   those claims. The fact is there's no quick fix for creditworthiness.
   You can improve your credit report legitimately, but it takes time, a
   conscious effort, and sticking to a personal debt repayment plan.

Your Rights

   No one can legally remove accurate and timely negative information from
   a credit report. You can ask for an investigation --at no charge to you
   -- of information in your file that you dispute as inaccurate or
   incomplete. Some people hire a company to investigate for them, but
   anything a credit repair company can do legally, you can do for
   yourself at little or no cost. By law:
     * You're entitled to a free credit report if a company takes "adverse
       action" against you, like denying your application for credit,
       insurance, or employment. You have to ask for your report within 60
       days of receiving notice of the action. The notice includes the
       name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company.
       You're also entitled to one free report a year if you're unemployed
       and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or
       if your report is inaccurate because of fraud, including identity
       theft.
     * Each of the nationwide credit reporting companies -- Equifax,
       Experian, and TransUnion -- is required to provide you with a free
       copy of your credit report once every 12 months, if you ask for it.
       To order, visit [23]annualcreditreport.com, or call 1-877-322-8228.
       You may order reports from each of the three credit reporting
       companies at the same time, or you can stagger your requests
       throughout the year.
     * It doesn't cost anything to dispute mistakes or outdated items on
       your credit report. Both the credit reporting company and the
       information provider (the person, company, or organization that
       provides information about you to a credit reporting company) are
       responsible for correcting inaccurate or incomplete information in
       your report. To take advantage of all your rights, contact both the
       credit reporting company and the information provider.

DIY

   Step 1: Tell the credit reporting company, in writing, what information
   you think is inaccurate. Use our [24]sample letter to help write your
   own. Include copies (NOT originals) of any documents that support your
   position. In addition to including your complete name and address, your
   letter should identify each item in your report that you dispute; state
   the facts and the reasons you dispute the information, and ask that it
   be removed or corrected. You may want to enclose a copy of your report,
   and circle the items in question. Send your letter by certified mail,
   "return receipt requested," so you can document that the credit
   reporting company got it. Keep copies of your dispute letter and
   enclosures.

   Credit reporting companies must investigate the items you question
   within 30 days -- unless they consider your dispute frivolous. They
   also must forward all the relevant data you provide about the
   inaccuracy to the organization that provided the information. After the
   information provider gets notice of a dispute from the credit reporting
   company, it must investigate, review the relevant information, and
   report the results back to the credit reporting company. If the
   investigation reveals that the disputed information is inaccurate, the
   information provider has to notify the nationwide credit reporting
   companies so they can correct it in your file.

   When the investigation is complete, the credit reporting company must
   give you the results in writing, too, and a free copy of your report if
   the dispute results in a change. If an item is changed or deleted, the
   credit reporting company cannot put the disputed information back in
   your file unless the information provider verifies that it's accurate
   and complete. The credit reporting company also must send you written
   notice that includes the name, address, and phone number of the
   information provider. If you ask, the credit reporting company must
   send notices of any correction to anyone who got your report in the
   past six months. You also can ask that a corrected copy of your report
   be sent to anyone who got a copy during the past two years for
   employment purposes.

   If an investigation doesn't resolve your dispute with the credit
   reporting company, you can ask that a statement of the dispute be
   included in your file and in future reports. You also can ask the
   credit reporting company to give your statement to anyone who got a
   copy of your report in the recent past. You'll probably have to pay for
   this service.

   Step 2: Tell the creditor or other information provider, in writing,
   that you dispute an item. Include copies (NOT originals) of documents
   that support your position. Many providers specify an address for
   disputes. If the provider reports the item to a consumer reporting
   company, it must include a notice of your dispute. And if the
   information is found to be inaccurate, the provider may not report it
   again.

Reporting Accurate Negative Information

   When negative information in your report is accurate, only time can
   make it go away. A credit reporting company can report most accurate
   negative information for seven years and bankruptcy information for 10
   years. Information about an unpaid judgment against you can be reported
   for seven years or until the statute of limitations runs out, whichever
   is longer. The seven-year reporting period starts from the date the
   event took place. There is no time limit on reporting information about
   criminal convictions; information reported in response to your
   application for a job that pays more than $75,000 a year; and
   information reported because you've applied for more than $150,000
   worth of credit or life insurance.

The Credit Repair Organizations Act

   The [25]Credit Repair Organization Act (CROA) makes it illegal for
   credit repair companies to lie about what they can do for you, and to
   charge you before they've performed their services. The CROA is
   enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and requires credit repair
   companies to explain:
     * your legal rights in a written contract that also details the
       services they'll perform
     * your three day right to cancel without any charge
     * how long it will take to get results
     * the total cost you will pay
     * any guarantees

   What if a credit repair company you hired doesn't live up to its
   promises? You have some options. You can:
     * sue them in federal court for your actual losses or for what you
       paid them, whichever is more
     * seek punitive damages -- money to punish the company for violating
       the law
     * join other people in a class action lawsuit against the company,
       and if you win, the company has to pay your attorney's fees

Report Credit Repair Fraud

   State Attorneys General

   Many states also have laws regulating credit repair companies. If you
   have a problem with a credit repair company, report it to your local
   consumer affairs office or to your [26]state attorney general (AG).

   Federal Trade Commission

   You also can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.
   Although the FTC can't resolve individual credit disputes, it can take
   action against a company if there's a pattern of possible law
   violations. File your complaint online at [27]ftc.gov/complaint or call
   1-877-FTC-HELP.

Where to Get Legitimate Help

   Just because you have a poor credit history doesn't mean you can't get
   credit. Creditors set their own standards, and not all look at your
   credit history the same way. Some may look only at recent years to
   evaluate you for credit, and they may give you credit if your
   bill-paying history has improved. It may be worthwhile to contact
   creditors informally to discuss their credit standards.

   If you're not disciplined enough to create a budget and stick to it, to
   work out a repayment plan with your creditors, or to keep track of your
   mounting bills, you might consider contacting a credit counseling
   organization. Many are nonprofit and work with you to solve your
   financial problems. But remember that "nonprofit" status doesn't
   guarantee free, affordable, or even legitimate services. In fact, some
   credit counseling organizations -- even some that claim nonprofit
   status -- may charge high fees or hide their fees by pressuring people
   to make "voluntary" contributions that only cause more debt.

   Most credit counselors offer services through local offices, online, or
   on the phone. If possible, find an organization that offers in-person
   counseling. Many universities, military bases, credit unions, housing
   authorities, and branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extension Service
   operate nonprofit credit counseling programs. Your financial
   institution, local consumer protection agency, and friends and family
   also may be good sources of information and referrals.

   If you're thinking about filing for bankruptcy, be aware that
   bankruptcy laws require that you get credit counseling from a
   government-approved organization within six months before you file for
   bankruptcy relief. You can find a state-by-state list of
   government-approved organizations at [28]www.usdoj.gov/ust, the website
   of the U.S. Trustee Program. That's the organization within the U.S.
   Department of Justice that supervises bankruptcy cases and trustees. Be
   wary of credit counseling organizations that say they are
   government-approved, but don't appear on the list of approved
   organizations.

   Reputable credit counseling organizations can advise you on managing
   your money and debts, help you develop a budget, and offer free
   educational materials and workshops. Their counselors are certified and
   trained in the areas of consumer credit, money and debt management, and
   budgeting. Counselors discuss your entire financial situation with you,
   and can help you develop a personalized plan to solve your money
   problems. An initial counseling session typically lasts an hour, with
   an offer of follow-up sessions.
