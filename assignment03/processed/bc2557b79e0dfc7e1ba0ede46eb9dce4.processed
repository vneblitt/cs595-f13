Donât swipe Ventra cards in your wallet, some say their debit card has been
charged instead

   ventra-CST-080313-03.jpg

   Reports are trickling in across the web of debit/credit cards being
   charged instead of Ventra cards when waving their wallet.

   Nausheen Husain~Sun-Times

   Rolling out a new citywide payment option for public transit is not
   going to come without its fair share of problems. [78]Getting trapped
   in turnstyles and [79]confusion about card distribution are obviously
   problems that are going to surface, but there's one teensy issue that
   might be harder to fix.

   Chicagoans have taken to Twitter to complain about their debit/credit
   cards being charged instead of their Ventra card after waving their
   wallet. This should only affect contactless payment enabled cards. Be
   on the safe side, take your Ventra card out of your wallet before
   swiping

   DePaul University of all places has provided an explanation:

     If you use your Ventra card while it's in your wallet, you could be
     charged twice since debit cards are also a payment form. Take it
     out!

     -- DePaul University (@DePaulU) [80]September 10, 2013

     Students: Ventra charges 1st touch-enabled card it senses. If you
     have touch debit/credit card, take U-Pass out of wallet to use.

     -- DePaul University (@DePaulU) [81]September 12, 2013

     Correction: Risk of [82]@VentraChicago scanner double-charging debit
     card in your wallet only a risk if using Visa Ventra pass, not
     U-Pass

     -- DePaul University (@DePaulU) [83]September 11, 2013

     [84]@VentraChicago Scanning my Ventra card through my wallet and
     come to find out the system is charging my debit card. I have CTA
     U-pass

     -- Aaron Brand (@genericBrand87) [85]September 12, 2013

     Do not put your [86]#Ventra card in your wallet! It will charge your
     debit card! [87]#cta [88]#bullshit [89]#scam

     -- Scott Sutton (@ScottSutton5) [90]September 11, 2013

     So apparently ventra's been charging my debit card everytime I used
     my Ventra card and it was nearby?!?!? Ughh beyond pissed!

     -- Mahyn Matata (@mayhem_mata) [91]September 11, 2013

     So, you have to protect your debit and credit cards from [92]#ventra
     or it will steal money. Nice [93]@cta [94]#cta !
