   Wynton Marsalis returns this month to Harvard to continue his lecture
   series.
   By Tania deLuzuriaga, Harvard Staff

   Wynton Marsalis will continue his lecture series this month, featuring
    the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra at Sanders Theatre on Sept. 26.

   Marsalis, the managing and artistic director of jazz at Lincoln Center,
   is an accomplished musician, composer, bandleader, educator, and
   advocate for the arts.

   Marsalis' lecture, "Setting the Communal Table: The Evolution of the
   Jazz Orchestra," will illustrate the relationship of written to
   improvised music and solo to ensemble playing, showcase important and
   unique musical techniques, and provide philosophical and communal
   insights. The lecture will begin at 7 p.m. and will be live streamed at
   Harvard.edu/livestream.

   "Focusing on the Jazz Age and the Swing Era, we will delve into the
   history of orchestral jazz, identify some of its main objectives,
   investigate its social victories, and showcase the significant musical
   breakthroughs in its evolution," Marsalis said. "I look forward to
   returning to Harvard with the outstanding musicians in the Jazz at
   Lincoln Center Orchestra."

   Marsalis' lecture series, "Hidden in Plain View: Meanings in American
   Music," is sponsored by the Office of the President and the Office of
   the Provost. The series launched in April 2011 before a capacity crowd
   with "Music as Metaphor," a two-hour journey through the history of
   American music, punctuated with performances by bluegrass and jazz
   musicians. He returned to campus in September 2011 with a team of
   dancers for his second lecture, "The Double Crossing of a Pair of
   Heels: The Dynamics of Social Dance and American Popular Musics," which
   traced the evolution of American social dance from the Charleston to
   the fox trot and the tango to the twist. His third lecture, "Meet Me at
   the Crossroad," in February 2012 examined the roots of American music.
   He returned to campus in April for "At the Speed of Instinct: Choosing
   Together to Play and Stay Together," an examination of improvisation.

   "During his inspirational appearances at Harvard, Wynton has shown us
   time and again how music captures the human experience in a way that
   connects us to something larger than ourselves," Harvard President Drew
   Faust said. "He has a gift for educating people about the value of the
   arts, and his series of lecture-performances has been a vital
   contribution to the conversation about the arts on campus."

   In addition to his lectures, Marsalis has engaged in dialogue with
   students throughout the University and community, taught master classes
   at a local high school, engaged in a panel discussion about education
   and the arts at the Graduate School of Education, and spoke at the
   Harvard Innovation Lab about the artist as an entrepreneur.

   A native of New Orleans, Marsalis is one of the nation's most highly
   decorated cultural figures. In addition to winning nine Grammy Awards,
   he was the first jazz musician to receive the Pulitzer Prize for music.

   His international accolades include honorary membership in Britain's
   Royal Academy of Music, the highest decoration for someone not a
   British citizen, and the insignia Chevalier of the Legion of Honor,
   France's highest distinction. He has more than 70 albums to his credit,
   which have sold more than 7 million copies, and three albums earned
   three gold records.

   Marsalis is also the first major jazz artist to perform and compose
   across the full spectrum of jazz, from its New Orleans roots to bebop
   and modern jazz. He has expanded the vocabulary of jazz by creating an
   expansive range of music for everything from quartets to big bands and
   symphony orchestras, and tap dance to ballet and modern dance. He was
   recently named a CBS News Cultural Correspondent. Harvard awarded him
   an honorary doctorate in music in 2009.

   Tickets for Marsalis' lecture at Sanders will be free. They will become
   available for the Harvard community on Sept. 17 and for the public on
   Sept. 19. For information on obtaining tickets, visit the [83]Harvard
   Box Office website. Learn more about [84]Wynton Marsalis.
