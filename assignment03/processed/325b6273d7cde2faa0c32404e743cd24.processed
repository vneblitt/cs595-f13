Healthy Eating

Good Nutrition

   The foods you choose to eat everyday affect your overall health.
   Nutrition experts offer [81]easy-to-read tip sheets to help you eat
   more whole grains, vegetables, fruit, calcium-rich foods, and lean
   protein.

   Use the [82]SuperTracker to set goals, keep track of what you eat, and
   get tips to help you make healthier choices.

Food Safety

   Each year, about one in six Americans become sick from [83]food
   poisoning. Although most will recover without any lasting problems,
   some types of food poisoning can lead to kidney failure, chronic
   arthritis, brain and nerve damage, and even death.

   By following [84]four simple steps, you can help to avoid food
   poisoning at home:
    1. Clean: wash hands and surfaces often.
    2. Separate: don't cross-contaminate raw meat, poultry, seafood, or
       eggs with other ready-to-eat foods.
    3. Cook: use a food thermometer to ensure you've cooked to the right
       temperature.
    4. Chill: refrigerate food within two hours of cooking and never thaw
       foods on the counter.

   On [85]FoodSafety.gov, you can sign up to [86]receive the latest
   information about food recalls.

Eating on a Budget

Healthy Eating on a Tight Budget

   Food can be expensive, but preparing your own meals is often healthier
   and less expensive than eating out. Get ideas to help you eat healthy
   meals on a budget, including:
     * [88]Sample 7-Day Menu
     * [89]Smart Shopping for Veggies and Fruits
       (PDF | download [90]Adobe Reader)
     * [91]10 Tips for Eating Better on a Budget
       (PDF | download [92]Adobe Reader)
     * [93]Get more healthy eating resources...

   Families with limited resources may qualify for the [94]Expanded Food
   and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP). This federally funded program
   shows participants how to make a food budget and select nutritious
   items.

Food Stamps

   Food stamps are officially called the [95]Supplemental Nutrition
   Assistance Program (SNAP). This federally funded program helps
   struggling families to put food on the table.

   Use a [96]pre-screening tool to find out if you're eligible for SNAP.

   Learn more about [97]how to apply for food stamp benefits.

Meal Programs for Children

   Federally assisted meal programs, such as the [98]National School Lunch
   Program and the [99]School Breakfast Program, provide
   [100]nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free meals to eligible
   children each school day. Learn more about [101]these and other school
   meal programs.

   The [102]Summer Food Service Program helps to fill the nutrition gap
   for eligible children when school lets out for the summer.

Fitness

   Being [104]physically active can help you to live longer, feel happier,
   sleep well, and maintain a healthy weight.

   For the biggest benefit, include both aerobic and muscle-strengthening
   activities in your exercise routine. Aerobic activities, such as
   walking and running, exercise your heart. Lifting weights and using
   exercise bands improve your muscle strength.

   Get some ideas for [105]increasing your physical activity. You can use
   the [106]Physical Activity Tracker to monitor your level of activity
   from week to week.
