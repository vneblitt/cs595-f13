       She's an idiot! How many times does he have to tell her that
       writing about religion is HIS JOB? Like being a reporter is her job
       even though she's not very good at it. Most reporters would
       actually read the book and not look at the back of the book.

       This `reporter' is a complete idiot. She is not even capable of an
       `intelligent' debate. To have an intelligent debate, one must
       listen to the other's response. How embarrassing all the way
       around!!! As a woman and as an American, I am just ashamed for her.
       His religion, BY RIGHT OF OUR CONSTITUTION in the USA, HE IS FREE
       TO CHOOSE, has nothing to do with what he has written. SHAME ON HER
       and the MEDIA who wrote her questions. DISGUSTING.

       Can't say I'm as concerned about it as everybody else. He makes a
       very good case and seems like a very genuine guy. But it is
       absolutely true that scholars do still often display a bias because
       of their beliefs. Now perhaps this guy is professional enough to
       avoid it, but I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest he might
       not be. it's really not that uncommon.

            Point is she didn't just accuse him of being biased (biases
            can be positive by the way) but implicitly of having an
            anti-Christian agenda (without providing any basis to make
            that argument other than that some other scholars disagree
            with him [scholars usually disagree with each other, that's
            what they do]).

       Although Aslan has his Doctorate the obvious lie he is making
       already put me off reading his book. The Romans never referred to
       that area of land as Palestine in that time period, it was called
       Judea and Samaria. Shocking to me for someone to use that term for
       that time period who is supposedly educated, he must be adding his
       own version to the truth.

            The name Palestine was given to that area by Roman Emperor
            Hadrian in 135 AD. Unless I'm remembering the video wrong, he
            didn't specify when the Romans called it that, he just said
            they did, which is correct (if slight misleading in context).
