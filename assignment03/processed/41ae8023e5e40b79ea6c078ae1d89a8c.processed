   [127][Woman in a green dress sits at a table with a copy of
   Lippincott's in front of her.],Lippincott's September., Digital ID
   1259028, New York Public Library The [128]centrality of sunshine... the
   most fascinating New York Times [129]obits of the year... the riddle of
   the [130]labyrinth... America's [131]signs, streets and storefronts...
   the [132]Central Park Five... [133]global weirdness... [134]how to
   look with expert eyes... how [135]food stopped being food... a slave
   [136]plantation on Long Island... the [137]New Deal...

   If you're interested in any of these topics, then we hope you'll join
   us for an Author @ the Library talk this month at [138]Mid-Manhattan to
   hear these accomplished non-fiction authors discuss their work. If
   you'd like to read the books mentioned, you can request copies using
   the links to the catalog included below. Author talks take place at
   6:30 p.m. on the 6th floor. No reservations are required.




   Tuesday, [139]September 3: Daniel Freund, author of [140]American
   Sunshine: Diseases of Darkness and the Quest for Natural Light, surveys
   the centrality of sunshine to an array of social reform and public
   health efforts in the United States from the mid-nineteenth century to
   the 1930s, with a quick glance at the present day.

   Monday, [141]September 9: New York Times Obituaries editor William
   McDonald tells us all about [142]The Socialite Who Killed a Nazi with
   Her Bare Hands and 143 Other Fascinating People Who Died This Past
   Year: The Best of the New York Times Obituaries, from August 2011 to
   July 2012.

   Tuesday, [143]September 10: Margalit Fox, author of [144]The Riddle of
   the Labyrinth: The Quest to Crack an Ancient Code, tells one of the
   most intriguing stories in the history of language, blending history,
   linguistics, and cryptology.

   Thursday, [145]September 12: Martin Treu, author of [146]Signs,
   Streets, and Storefronts: A History of Architecture and Graphics along
   America's Commercial Corridors, gives an illustrated lecture exploring
   the architectural history and signage of Main Street and the
   strip--from painted boards nailed over crude storefronts to sleek
   cinemas topped with neon glitz.





   Tuesday, [147]September 17: Writer and filmmaker Sarah Burns tells the
   tragic story of the wrongful convictions of five teenagers who were
   sent to prison for a combined 40 years, describes how the book and
   documentary film, [148]The Central Park Five: A Chronicle of a City
   Wilding, came into being, and explains the ongoing legal drama
   surrounding the case. This lecture will also include clips from the
   [149]film, which she co-directed with David McMahon and Ken Burns.

   Wednesday, [150]September 18: Michael D. Lemonick of [151]Climate
   Central gives a visual presentation summarizing everything we already
   know about the science of climate change, explain what is likely to
   happen to the climate in the future and lay out in practical terms what
   we can and cannot do to avoid further shifts. Climate Central's recent
   book is [152]Global Weirdness: Severe Storms, Deadly Heat Waves,
   Relentless Drought, Rising Seas and the Weather of the Future.

   Thursday, [153]September 19: At any given moment we filter out the bulk
   of the information streaming around us. Psychologist and animal
   behaviorist Alexandra Horowitz, author of [154]On Looking: Eleven Walks
   with Expert Eyes, gives a visual presentation that offers ways to tune
   into myriad sights, sounds, and smells.





   Monday, [155]September 23: Food journalist Frederick Kaufman, author of
   [156]Bet the Farm: How Food Stopped Being Food, follows the trail from
   Big Pizza to square tomatoes to exploding food prices to Wall Street in
   an attempt to figure out why we can't all have healthy, delicious,
   affordable food.

   Tuesday, [157]September 24: In [158]The Manor: Three Centuries at a
   Slave Plantation on Long Island, Mac Griswold portrays a uniquely
   American place as he tells both the story of Sylvester Manor, a house
   which had been held in the same family for eleven generations, and the
   extensive but little-known story of Northern slavery.

   Wednesday, [159]September 25: Professor Ira Katznelson, author of
   [160]Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time, redefines
   our traditional understanding of the New Deal and examines this pivotal
   American era through a sweeping international lens that juxtaposes a
   struggling democracy with enticing ideologies like fascism and
   communism.

   You can find lists of non-fiction books from current and past Author @
   the Library programs in the [162]BiblioCommons catalog.

   The Author @ the Library posts include only authors discussing their
   recent non-fiction books at the Mid-Manhattan Library, but we have many
   other interesting readings and talks on our [163]calendar,
   including [164]art lectures and discussions, [165]monthly panel
   discussions featuring authors from the [166]Mystery Writers of America,
   New York Chapter, short story readings at [167]Story Time for
   Grown-ups, and on [168]September 26th, the Triangle Theater Company
   will perform "A Celebration of T. S. Eliot."  We hope to see you
   sometime soon at one of our great free programs!
