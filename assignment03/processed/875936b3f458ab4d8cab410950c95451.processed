About the Program

   The Kissinger Program establishes a non-partisan focus in the nation‚s
   capital for the discussion of key issues in foreign affairs. The
   Program aims to serve as a catalyst for the fresh analysis of foreign
   affairs in the global era by sustaining in perpetuity two appointments
   and related programs that ensure that the subject of foreign affairs,
   taken broadly, receives reflective and considered treatment each year
   in Washington, D.C. by distinguished, experienced scholars and
   practitioners.

Kissinger Scholar

   The Kissinger Scholar is the first of the two distinguished
   appointments. The Kissinger Scholar holds the Kissinger Chair and is
   appointed annually by the Librarian of Congress upon the recommendation
   of a Selection Committee consisting of representatives from the
   academic community and high-ranking foreign policy experts no longer in
   office. The Scholar is a distinguished senior research position in
   residence at the Library‚s John W. Kluge Center that engages in
   research on foreign policy and international affairs that will lead to
   publication. ¬

Kissinger Lecturer

   The Kissinger Lecturer is the second of the appointments. The Lecturer
   is appointed by the Librarian of Congress to deliver the Kissinger
   Lecture, a high-profile address delivered on Capitol Hill to
   Congressional and Federal agency members and staff, diplomats, foreign
   policy experts, area universities and the foreign policy community
   at-large. The Lecturer will have achieved distinction in the field of
   foreign affairs and, like the Scholar, may be of any nationality.

The Setting

   Uniquely situated for research, analysis and serious discussion of
   America‚s relation to the world, the Library of Congress offers
   facilities for scholars, universal collections spanning more than 470
   languages, broad language and subject expertise of the Library staff,
   the central and neutral position of the Library on Capitol Hill, and
   the inspiring atmosphere of the magnificent Thomas Jefferson Building
   in which to annually examine the general subject of the United States
   and its relationship with the world.

Funding

   The Kissinger Program is made possible by generous donations of the
   friends and admirers of Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, the 56th Secretary of
   State of the United States and a past recipient of the Nobel Peace
   Prize. Librarian of Congress James H. Billington announced the
   establishment of the Henry A. Kissinger Chair in Foreign Policy and
   International Relations at the Library of Congress on June 26, 2000,
   during the Library‚s Bicentennial year. The Library of Congress holds a
   collection of Henry A. Kissinger‚s papers covering his years of
   government service and donated to the Library in 1977.

Kissinger Lecturers

   The Kissinger Lecturer was created through the generosity of friends of
   the former Secretary of State to honor both the man and a field of
   inquiry so important for America's future.

   The Kissinger Lecturer is appointed by the Librarian of Congress upon
   the recommendation of the Kissinger Chair Steering Committee. The
   Kissinger Lecturer, like the Kissinger Scholar, has achieved
   distinction in the field of foreign affairs and may be of any
