Disability survey: 'Take my wisdom, not my dignity'

   [d8de0a31b8eff57e01cb4b0bdb6eb033-450x0.jpg]
   Resilient character: Firoz Ali Alizada soon after his amputations
   (left) and as an adult still wearing the same determined look to
   succeed and contribute in life.

   By Andy McElroy
   GENEVA, 3 September 2013 - Double amputee Firoz Ali Alizada believes
   that people living with disabilities are the biggest untapped resource
   for disaster planners around the world.
   The 31-year-old uses the example of his home country Afghanistan where
   people living with disabilities remain on the margins of decision
   making despite providing such a compelling example of day to day
   resilience.
   "Good strategic sense, not pity, should demand that the perspectives of
   people living with disabilities are central to plans and actions in
   disaster management," Mr Alizada said.
   "Most people with disabilities deal with 'mini-disasters' each day.
   They are living examples of how to succeed in difficult circumstances,
   exactly the sort of people who have practical ideas that could be used
   by decision makers to make the country safer.
   "Their unique and first hand experiences are not only beneficial to the
   safety of vulnerable groups but to all people at risk of disasters.
   "However, in Afghanistan I am mostly greeted with a rather negative
   kind of sympathy. The prevailing attitude is very much charity based
   and it also comes with a sense that I am a burden.
   "It is a shame because I believe that I have so much to offer: they
   should take my wisdom, not my dignity. There has been progress but we
   still have long way to go."
   One day, when Mr Alizada was 13 years old, as he walked to school in
   his village, Jaraf, in Parwan province, north of Kabul, he stepped on a
   landmine.
   Injured and in shock, his brother and relatives carried him two and a
   half hours to the nearest main road. By the time a truck dropped them
   at Charikar hospital 14 hours later Mr Alizada had lost consciousness.
   The clinic was overflowing and his brother paid a surgeon to treat Mr
   Alizada quicker. When he woke up his left leg was amputated above the
   knee and his right leg below the knee.
   Mr Alizada's experience is a graphic illustration of the importance of
   first aid. "The blast took two toes on my right foot and the whole of
   my left foot. But after surgery I had lost most my right leg below the
   knee and my left leg above the knee," he said.
   "Doctors in Kabul later told me that if I had had even the most basic
   of help quickly and appropriately then the surgery would have been far
   less radical; in other words I wouldn't have lost both of my legs."
   Mr Alizada is one of thousands of people around the world who have
   participated in the first-ever survey of people living with
   disabilities and disasters - organised by the UN Office for Disaster
   Risk Reduction (UNISDR) and partners - to mark the 2013 International
   Day for Disaster Reduction on 13 October.
   "I wish, like my fellows around the world, to meaningfully participate
   in disaster management at all levels because our participation makes a
   difference in saving lives and reducing risks, particularly those
   avoidable risks that are a threat to people with disabilities," Mr
   Alizada said.
   Have Your Say! If you're living with a disability or you are a
   caregiver, take our survey and share your thoughts on living with
   disasters. The survey is available [44]here in several languages.
