Nicole Kidman CREAMED By Photog On Bicycle ... Crash Caught on Tape [VIDEO]

   9/13/2013 8:00 AM PDT [29]BY TMZ STAFF
   Nicole Kidman
   CREAMED BY PHOTOG ...
   CAUGHT ON TAPE
   Exclusive
   YOU GOTTA SEE THIS VIDEO ... IT'S CRAZY.
   TMZ has obtained video of a paparazzo on an out-of-control bicycle
   Thursday ... careening into Nicole Kidman and knocking her flat on her
   butt -- and he was going FAST.
   You see photog Carl Wu trying in vain to stop as he careened into
   Nicole outside the Carlyle Hotel in NYC.  You also hear Nicole
   screaming about pressing charges, and Carl profusely apologizing.
   FYI, Carl wasn't arrested because cops said it was just an accident --
   but he was cited for riding his bike on a sidewalk.
   Amazingly ... Nicole wasn't injured.

   That guy is crazy riding his bike that fast on the sidewalk, especially
   in front of hotel where there is heavy foot traffic. There were quite a
   few people and he didn't bother to brake till the last moment. All he
   got was cited? New York too busy to care if someone is seriously hurt
   by bicyclists on sidewalk?

   many sidewalks are legal to ride a bike on and unless it is
   posted,marked and listed as a NON bike zone sidewalk he could beat the
   charge in court.he did get way to close to her and was lucky her body
   guard did`nt knock him out for the danger he placed her in.I`d rather
   get a ticket for riding on a sidewalk than get runover by street
   traffics

   If that had been a celebrity on the bicycle and ran into a pap on the
   sidewalk, the pap's first call would have been to his lawyer to issue a
   multi million dollar lawsuit.

   Not the first time this paps has been involved in something like this
   while the rest of the paps run to gets shots. Again where are the laws
   for such incidents, not even the police can do anything about it until
   laws are put in place. it's disgusting pap stalkers win again!
