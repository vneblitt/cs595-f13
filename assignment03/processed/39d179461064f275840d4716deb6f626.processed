Top official calls on Iran, DPR Korea, to cooperate with UN atomic agency

   9 September 2013 - The head of the United Nations atomic energy agency
   today stressed the need for both Iran and the Democratic People's
   Republic of Korea (DPRK) to cooperate in resolving outstanding issues
   regarding their nuclear activities.

   The Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency
   ([72]IAEA), Yukiya Amano, [73]said the Agency remains committed to
   working with the two countries on nuclear verification activities, and
   urged the Governments to fulfil their obligations.

   "The DPRK's statements concerning a third nuclear test and its
   intention to restart its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, together with
   its previous statements about uranium enrichment activities and the
   construction of a light water reactor, are deeply regrettable," said
   Mr. Amano, in his introductory statement to the Agency's annual General
   Conference in Vienna, which brings together representatives from the
   IAEA's 155 member States.

   "Such actions are clear violations of relevant UN Security Council
   resolutions."

   Mr. Amano noted that the IAEA has been unable to carry out verification
   activities in the DPRK since 2009, which has limited the Agency's
   knowledge of the country's nuclear programme.

   "I call upon the DPRK to comply fully with its obligations under
   relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate promptly with the
   Agency in implementing its Safeguards Agreement and to resolve all
   outstanding issues," he said.

   Turning to Iran, Mr. Amano said the Middle Eastern country is not
   providing the necessary cooperation to enable us to provide credible
   assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and
   activities, adding that "the Agency therefore cannot conclude that all
   nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities."

   Iran's nuclear programme - which its officials have stated is for
   peaceful purposes, but some other countries contend is driven by
   military ambitions - has been a matter of international concern since
   the discovery in 2003 that the country had concealed its nuclear
   activities for 18 years in breach of its obligations under the Nuclear
   Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

   A round of talks on the issue is planned for 27 September in Vienna,
   and the Board of Governors has stressed that it is essential for Iran
   to immediately conclude and implement the structured approach. Mr.
   Amano added that the IAEA is committed to working with Iran's new
   Government to resolve outstanding issues by diplomatic means.

   Given the nature and extent of credible information available to the
   Agency about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme,
   Mr. Amano said: "It remains essential and urgent for Iran to engage
   with us on the substance of our concerns." He also reiterated that
   Agency's request that Iran, without further delay, provide substantive
   answers to its detailed questions regarding the location within the
   Parchin site and the foreign expert, and provide access to the location
   concerned.

   "I continue to urge Iran to fully implement its Safeguards Agreement
   and its other obligations and to engage with the Agency to achieve
   concrete results on all outstanding substantive issues," he said.

   In his remarks, Mr. Amano also reported on the progress made in the
   implementation of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, which was
   endorsed in the aftermath of the accident at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi
   Nuclear Power Station in 2011.

   "Recent events in Japan are a clear reminder of the continuing impact
   of the Fukushima Daiichi accident. The leak of contaminated water at
   Fukushima Daiichi is a matter of high priority that needs to be
   addressed urgently," he said.

   "Recognizing the importance of this issue, the IAEA international peer
   review mission to Japan in April recommended that Japan establish an
   effective plan and mechanisms for the long-term management of liquid
   waste. The announcement by the Japanese Government of a basic policy
   for addressing this issue is an important step forward."

   Mr. Amano added that the IAEA remains ready to assist Japan and will
   send a second international peer review mission in the next months to
   offer further advice.
