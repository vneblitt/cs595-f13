The Ultimate Backseat Bookshelf: 100 Must-Reads For Kids 9-14

   August 05, 2013 9:10 AM
   Illustration: Kids' Bookshelf
   Andrew Bannecker

   As we enter the last stretch of summer before school starts again, we
   present our [55]big annual book list â and this year, we're focusing on
   great reads for kids.

   Back in June, [56]NPR's Backseat Book Club â our book club for young
   readers â asked you, the NPR audience, [57]to nominate your favorite
   books for kids age 9-14. More than 2,000 of you replied, giving us
   hundreds and hundreds of titles to consider. So we turned to our expert
   panel (read more about them â and their Newbery honors! â [58]here),
   who combined audience favorites with their own choices to come up with
   a curated list of 100 must-reads.

   The final 100 has a little bit of everything: tales of trying to fit
   in, escaping to magical lands, facing prejudice, coming of age and
   fighting to survive. There are animal stories, pioneer sagas,
   science-fiction adventures and, of course, beloved classics.

   So if you're looking for a new book for the young readers in your life
   â or you want to relive that age yourself â please stick around and
   browse our bookshelf. (Here's a [59]printable version of the list,
   too.) And if your favorite book is missing, please tell us about it â
   nicely! â in the comments. Happy reading!
