   Khloe Kardashian
   Cracked After Lamar OD Rumors Spread
   Exclusive
   0830-khloe-kardashian-lamar-odom-article-tmz
   Khloe Kardashian still has deep feelings for the man she threw out of
   their house, because TMZ has learned she was terrified after hearing
   rumors Lamar Odom may have OD'd on crack.
   Rumors were circulating late last week that Lamar had OD'd and was
   dying ... not all that unbelievable considering his drug addiction ...
   and when Khloe heard about it she freaked.
   We're told Khloe "panicked" and began power dialing Lamar's cell phone,
   but it kept going to voicemail.  She then started calling his friends
   -- a bunch of them -- trying to figure out if the rumor was true.
   She finally got Lamar on the phone.  He was at their downtown loft and
   said he was fine and the rumor was false.
   We're told at that point Khloe pulled back and reiterated -- Lamar
   could not come back home unless he got treatment for his drug
   addiction.  The call ended shortly thereafter.
   So it seems she still loves the guy ... but had clearly drawn a line in
   the sand.

   Im the first to post a true post. This is either all for ratings, or
   shes scared hes filing for divorce an shes screwed. Hes the healthiest
   crack head ive ever seen. He knows he can deny it, but the kkk klan
   will come up with more proof to tear him down. Hes been playing ball,
   mb not his best since the lakers, but i dont know any crack head who
   can perform a tough sport an have practices all the time an his coaches
   never noticed. Something just doesnt add up....

   So Far TMZ can prove Lamar Has a DUI. There is absolutely no evidence
   on TMZ website that even cir***stantial evidence proves Lamar Odoms has
   a Crack Cocaine Problem.

   This is so sad what drugs does to a person. Imagine he would rather
   give up his life for a hit? This epidemic is heartbreaking! But I would
   be interested in known when he began using this? Was it the fame and
   accessiability that made him rampant! No wonder Kobe was mad with him.
   He knew Lamar was a closet crackhead.

   if she truly care for him she would get behind him and do whatever it
   takes to help him, instead of letting her mother run a slander campaign
   via a short money hungry gay old man with a gossip site, in case of a
   divorce and a moronic reality show plot.

   Yeah Kloey probably throws a similar tantrum when she runs out of
   hairspray or vodka. She needs to be devoting her full attention to
   losing weight, not this other foolishness. Let him OD and get it on
   camera.

   Another planted story. She pulled back and said he couldn't come home?
   At what point did he say he wanted to? SHE freaked out and called him,
   SHE initiated the conversation. It's pretty clear if this is true that
   she is trying every way she can to talk to him and he just is over her.
   Why do these people think we care about these personal stories? They're
   over saturating the public with needless BS. Now it's time for Khloe to
   post another professional selfie on twitter or video tape herself
   singing and driving! Life is swell according to her actions so whoever
   is planting these stories isn't HER!

   Most logical explanation for ALL of the recent family DRAMA is this
   leads up to "BS PR" for their next "SCAMILY Project"...

   NEVER believe what any of these GYPSIES say.
