   Cousins Stephen Amell, 32, and Robbie Amell, 25, are used to having
   "Football Sundays" together, but starting Oct. 9, they'll share
   something else: "Amell Wednesdays."

   [46]'Arrow' scoop: Will Oliver and Felicity get together in season 2?

   The CW will air their action-packed dramas back-to-back (the returning
   Arrow at 8 p.m., followed by The Tomorrow People at 9 p.m.). We chatted
   with them for EW's [47]Fall TV Preview issue, on newsstands now. Read
   that Q&A to find out who's shirtless in more episodes this season (so
   far) and where Robbie falls on the list of people Stephen will call to
   babysit (his wife, Cassandra Jean, is expecting their first child later
   this year). In the meantime, here's more.
   ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Whatâs the most heroic thing youâve seen each
   other do in real life?
   Robbie (star of The Tomorrow People): I didnât see him do it, but [in
   early 2005] ÂStephen tried to stop a fight on the street in Toronto and
   ended getting a bottle smashed over his head. He stopped the fight from
   happening with his skull. I think thatâs a pretty badass, heroic thing
   to do.

   Stephen (star of Arrow): I was successful, retrospectively, but at the
   time it didnât feel that way. I had some staples in the back of my
   head. ... I think weâve teamed up for some pretty heroic beer-pong
   runs.

   Robbie: Oh my goodness, Stephen and I are, for lack of a better word,
   phenomenal at beer pong.

   Stephen: We egg each other on because of our hyper-competitive nature.

   Robbie: What did we have, like, 11 wins in one night one time?

   You both grew up in Toronto. What did you do together as children?
   Robbie: I was so young.Â I remember pool parties. His family's house
   had a pool, so my family would go over and swim. And video games, for
   sure. This was so long ago, it was Super Nintendo. Stephen even had the
   Super Scope -- the big huge rocket-launcher-looking gun that comes with
   Super Nintendo. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. That's
   probably the main reason why I hung out with him.

   Stephen: We were able to have that relationship for a couple of years,
   because with the age gap, thereâs that sort of spot where youâre a
   little paternal almost, and then you get to the spot where that would
   be weird [Robbie laughs], and then you circle back to where you can
   become friends again, and thatâs where we are now.

   Was it easy to reconnect as adults in L.A.?
   Robbie: Yeah, it's one of those things where family and good friends,
   even if you havenât seen them for a long time, it happens pretty
   quickly. All of my close friends out there brought Stephen in right
   away. Weâve got a really good group out there, and Stephen would host
   Football Sundays every Sunday.

   Stephen: Thereâs enough of a genetic overlap that things just picked up
   really quickly again. Robbie and I have certain things that are very
   different about us, but thereâs just an overwhelming number of things
   that you can just tell that weâre family.

   Robbie: We were watching the Olympics at a bar [in 2010], and I walk in
   late, and my first two comments were the first two things Stephen said
   when he sat down. Everybody was like, âWhat the hell just happened?â
   Something about the size of the TV. And I donât know if it was the
   thing I ordered.

   Were your paths into acting similar?
   Robbie: I totally fell into acting. I had done commercials and stuff
   when I was young, butÂ [2005's] Cheaper by the Dozen 2 was the first
   movie audition I had ever had. It was supposed to be a non-speaking
   role. I ended up getting a couple lines, but I was there for 80 percent
   of the shoot. It kinda jump-started the whole thing. But Stephen had
   been doing it for a little while at that point, right? Maybe a year or
   two?

   Stephen: Yeah. Itâs weird, because we ended up getting to roughly the
   same spot in the industry but we went about it in a completely
   different way. Robbie just jumped right into it and was in Los Angeles
   almost immediately, and it took me almost six years to go to L.A.
   full-time and really commit to it in the same way. When I saw Robbie in
   Toronto [when he was filming Cheaper by the Dozen 2], I remember I was
   walking up Yonge Street, and I saw Robbie pulling over in a Mustang. My
   first consideration was, "How is he possibly old enough to drive?" And
   my second consideration was, âYouâre what? Youâre acting? Youâre doing
   this movie here?â

   Are there any other actors in the family?
   Robbie: My dad did [2000's]Â American Psycho.Â He used to do background
   workÂ back then. Itâs one of my favorite movies. I had seen it probably
   six or seven times, and I was sitting there watching it, and he phoned
   me, and he asked me what I was doing, and I told him, and he was like,
   âOh, youâre watching my movie?â I just kind of laughed and continued
   talking to him because I didnât know what he was talking about. And
   then he came back to it, and I was like, âWhat are you talking about?â
   And he told me where to look for him, and sure enough, heâs the
   bartender in the background. All I thought was, âWhat if you died and I
   was watching the movie one time, and there you were in the background?â
   [Laughs]

   Stephen: Oh my God.

   Robbie: A little dark, but it wouldâve been super weird. Thatâs as
   close as any of the rest of the family is to acting.

   Robbie, what kind of advice has Stephen given you?
   Robbie: I kinda got to sit shotgun while he went through being number
   one on a massive TV show with huge stunts and a lot of action, and
   pretty much as heavy a workload as you can get in this industry. He
   would talk to me about things, so I found myself adequately prepared
   for this year. When he did give me advice, it was just to make sure
   that I do my work, and I get my sleep, because it's the best job in the
   world, but itâs a lot of work.

   Stephen: Itâs a long, long process shooting the first season. Robbie
   has done [48]a couple of series before, but just getting in to 22/23
   episodes nonstop, itâs just different. And you really need to prepare
   yourself for the grind of it all. One of the nice things has been a lot
   of the directors that we had on Arrow have gone over to Tomorrow
   People, and I know that we share the stunt departments on the shows, so
   a lot of the things that we had to work out last year and didnât really
   get operating smoothly until maybe episode 11, 12, 13 have hopefully
   slid over to Robbieâs set, and I hope you guys are having a smoother
   ride. Not that ours was troublesome, but I think itâs been helpful.

   Robbie: Like Stephen said, you learn so much in 22 episodes. Theyâve
   come over to our show, and it doesnât feel like weâre shooting a first
   season, because the people that weâre working with are so good at what
   they do.

   Greg Berlanti, who exec-produces both of your shows, told us a quality
   he sometimes wishes you didnât have in common was liking to do your own
   stunts: âSomething happens to them, and youâre done.â
   Stephen: In the third episode this year, Iâm running through a field
   and Âexplosions are going off, and when I got up from one take,
   everyone had come up from behind the monitors and was staring and
   legitimately thought that I had been blown up and the show was over. I
   was perfectly fine.

   Robbie: I havenât gotten blown up yet, but Iâm hoping for something
   like that. That sounds awesome.
