New Abortion Restrictions in States Are 0 for 8 in Courts

   By Andrew Harris - 2013-08-20T19:50:07Z

   State legislatures trying to curtail abortions have suffered a 0-for-8
   losing streak after court challenges to their new laws this year.

   The laws, all but one signed by Republican governors, drew on ideas
   from a playbook created by an anti-abortion group. Democrats plan to
   use the attempted curbs to boost 2014 congressional fundraising and
   increase voter support, calling the laws part of a "War on Women."

   Four states' statutes attacked the core of the U.S. [58]Supreme Court's
   rulings that a woman has a right to the procedure before a fetus is
   viable. Efforts to bar abortions after six, 12 and 20 weeks of
   pregnancy were halted in [59]North Dakota, [60]Arkansas and [61]Idaho.
   An appeals court struck down [62]Arizona's 20-week ban. Laws imposing
   restrictions on doctors were blocked in North Dakota and two other
   states.

   Trying to ban abortions before a fetus can live outside the mother's
   womb "flies in the face" of U.S. Supreme Court rulings, said [63]Paul
   B. Linton, a lawyer with the Chicago-based Thomas More Society whose
   group, an opponent of abortion, isn't involved in defending
   early-pregnancy curbs.

   Efforts to limit early-pregnancy abortions are unlikely to succeed, he
   said.

Federal Courts

   "I cannot see the Supreme Court upholding any of these laws with
   respect to the pre-viability applications," Linton said in an
   interview, adding: "I can't see those laws being upheld by lower
   federal courts."

   A judge in Bismarck, North Dakota, supported that view on July 22 in
   temporarily striking down a state law barring abortions at the sixth
   week of pregnancy, when a fetal heartbeat can typically be detected,
   except in cases of medical emergency.

   "The state has extended an invitation to an expensive court battle over
   a law restricting abortions that is a blatant violation of the
   constitutional guarantees afforded all women," U.S. District Judge
   Daniel L. Hovland wrote.

   It has been 40 years since the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade established
   a woman's constitutional right to terminate an early pregnancy. Thirty
   states limited or prohibited abortions at the time. Colorado became the
   first to legalize it in 1967, after about 80 years of legislation
   against the procedure in the U.S., according to the pro-choice
   [64]National Abortion Federation.

Curb Procedures

   The high court reiterated its stance in "Roe" in 1992's [65]Planned
   Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. The decisions didn't
   end legislative attempts to curb the procedure.

   Leading the anti-abortion campaign in the states are the
   Washington-based groups [66]Americans United for Life and [67]National
   Right to Life Committee. The latter organization started lobbying
   before "Roe," said Mary Spaulding Balch, its state-legislation
   director.

   "Not a single year has gone by where we didn't pass some piece of
   substantive legislation," she said. "Our state affiliates have been in
   the trenches from the beginning."

   Americans United for Life publishes an annual review of laws in states
   titled "Defending Life," a guide for lawmakers that contains model
   legislation.

   "We believe that in the end, the abortion issue ought to be left to the
   states, that it was a serious judicial error for the United States
   Supreme Court to put itself in the position of being the abortion
   control board for the country," said Ovide Lamontagne, the
   organization's general counsel and a two-time Republican candidate for
   governor of New Hampshire. "We are essentially providing a resource for
   legislators across the country."

`Defending Life'

   Model bills in "Defending Life" and proposals by state affiliates of
   the National Right to Life Committee have been the impetus for some of
   the bills.

   "Some people call it the playbook," [68]Jordan Goldberg, state advocacy
   counsel for the New York-based [69]Center for Reproductive Rights, said
   of "Defending Life."

   "If you look, you will see a lot of the legislation that's pending,"
   based on the models, Goldberg said in a phone interview. "It's not as
   if the people in North Dakota woke up one day and said, `We have a real
   problem with the admitting privileges.'"

   Her organization, the [70]American Civil Liberties Union and
   [71]Planned Parenthood, have led the legal opposition to laws targeting
   abortion.

Admitting Privileges

   Laws resembling Americans United for Life's proposal to require doctors
   performing abortions to have admitting privileges at hospitals within
   30 miles of their facilities passed in [72]Mississippi and North
   Dakota.

   Those laws were temporarily blocked by judges who found they likely
   burdened a woman's right in states where doctors would be unable to
   obtain the privileges and sole clinics would be forced to close.

   Similar laws now blocked would have shuttered three of five clinics in
   [73]Alabama and in [74]Wisconsin would have closed two of four and
   curtailed services at a third.

   Proponents of North Dakota's law argued it was needed to guarantee
   emergency care for abortion patients. It would have closed the Red
   River Women's Clinic in Fargo.

   State Judge Wickham Corwin said abortions performed there are
   "extremely safe and effective" pre-viability procedures, making the
   statute unnecessary.

Undue Burden

   In his July 31 decision, the judge also said the law posed an undue
   burden on women and that it ran afoul of the Supreme Court's "Casey"
   decision.

   Of the three hospitals within the specified 30-mile radius of the Red
   River clinic, Corwin said, one is affiliated with the Catholic Church
   and can't be involved with abortions; the second -- a U.S. veterans'
   hospital -- is barred from doing them by federal law; and the third has
   an annual minimum patient-admission requirement for a doctor's
   affiliation.

   "The legislature has shown open disdain for the rights clearly
   protected by the federal Constitution," Corwin wrote.

   Two hundred miles to the west in Bismarck on July 22, Hovland, the
   federal judge, was similarly critical in calling the fetal-heartbeat
   law a "blatant violation" of [75]women's rights.

   Upon signing that measure into law in March, Republican Governor Jack
   Dalrymple acknowledged its uncertain future by saying its chance of
   surviving a court challenge was "in question." He called it "a
   legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of
   Roe v. Wade."

Real Restrictions

   "The courts are incredibly important stopgaps, but nobody should be
   sanguine to think the courts are the solution to this," Louise Melling,
   the ACLU's deputy legal director, said in a telephone interview, adding
   that resistance is needed in the state legislatures.

   "It's important that people realize the impact of these restrictions is
   real," Melling said. The New York-based group earlier this year
   launched a [76]web page, dedicated to the proposition that the abortion
   rights issue is a women's issue.

   An adjacent page states that more than 300 abortion-restrictive laws
   have been introduced by state legislators this year.

   Steven R. Morrison, a constitutional-law professor at the University of
   North Dakota in Grand Forks, said some lawmakers don't understand the
   constitutional implications of their work.

   "They truly believe abortion is murder," Morrison said. "Why wouldn't
   you pass a law that prohibits it? But we don't live in a theocracy, we
   live in a democracy, and they're ignoring the case law as it stands."

Futile Attempt

   Even a futile attempt to curb abortion has moral, political and legal
   value, said Donald P. Judges, a [77]University of Arkansas law
   professor.

   "For some it's to make a point to their constituents or perceived
   constituents," said Judges, the author of "Hard Choices Lost Voices:
   How the Abortion Conflict Had Divided America, Distorted Constitutional
   Rights, and Damaged the Courts."

   In his state, a measure curbing abortions at the 12th week of pregnancy
   was passed this year by the legislature over Governor Mike Beebe's
   veto. Then it was blocked in court by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber
   Wright.

   Drawing conclusions about trends should await final rulings on the
   merits of cases challenging state restrictions and subsequent appeals,
   Lamontagne, of Americans United for Life, said in an e-mail. "Trial
   courts apply the law as they understand it to be, and they are not
   always correct," he said.

   Peter Rofes, a Marquette University law professor in [78]Milwaukee,
   said there's a positive side to investing "the time, the effort, the
   money to engage the challenge" of proposing laws almost certain to
   prompt lawsuits they may not survive.

   "It's a victory for those who seek to keep it in the nation's
   consciousness," he said.

Current Court

   Rofes predicted the federal cases will rise at least to the regional
   appeals courts of appeal. Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen
   has filed papers signaling his intention to appeal an Aug. 2 ruling by
   a U.S. judge temporarily blocking the state's hospital affiliate law.

   Judges, the Arkansas law professor, agreed.

   "I don't think the current court is inclined to revisit Roe," he said.
   "Until there's a one-justice switch, I think it's going to rest in the
   lower courts."

   Chief Justice [79]John Roberts and associate justices [80]Antonin
   Scalia, [81]Clarence Thomas and [82]Samuel Alito are perceived as the
   most likely to vote to revisit the issue and perhaps alter the status
   quo, Rofes said.

   Justices Anthony Kennedy, Steven Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, [83]Sonia
   Sotomayor and Elena Kagan are widely viewed as unwilling to
   fundamentally alter the law, he said.

   National Right to Life is pushing for a different kind of legislation,
   barring abortion at the 20th week of a pregnancy on the ground that a
   fetus at that point can feel pain.

Neural Pathways

   Such measures have been passed in the U.S. House of Representatives and
   10 states, most recently [84]Texas.

   "Pain is a subjective experience, no matter who is experiencing it,"
   [85]Cassing Hammond, a professor at [86]Northwestern University in
   [87]Chicago and a doctor of obstetrics and gynecology, said in a phone
   interview. Neural pathways that transmit that sensation and cerebral
   development needed to process it as pain typically don't fully develop
   in a fetus until at least the 23rd week of a pregnancy, he said, and
   possibly not until the 29th.

   "We simply do not have evidence that those pathways are in place" at 20
   weeks, he said, even if neuroscience has advanced since Roe. "These
   bans do not make good scientific sense."

   Hammond served as chairman of the National Abortion Federation's board
   from 2010 to 2012. He said his views are "not about politics. It's
   about providing safe care to patients."

   Linton of the Thomas More Society said of the pre-viability fetal-pain
   laws, "I would like to see these bills upheld. I just don't think they
   will be."

   An Arizona law criminalizing abortions performed at or after the 20th
   week of pregnancy was struck down May 21 by a San Francisco-based
   federal appeals court. Prohibiting the procedure before fetal viability
   is unconstitutional, the court said.

   State lawmakers based the statute on "the documented risks to women's
   health and the strong medical evidence that unborn children feel pain
   during an abortion at that gestational age," according to the appeals
   court ruling.

   The state has until Sept. 28 to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for
   review. Americans United for Life was among the groups filing briefs in
   support of the law. Arguing against it were attorneys from the Center
   and the ACLU.

   Balch of National Right to Life said her organization hopes the Supreme
   Court finds a compelling state interest in protecting the life of a
   child that can feel pain, based on science that wasn't available in
   1973.

   "It hasn't been before the court before, and we would welcome that
   challenge," she said.
