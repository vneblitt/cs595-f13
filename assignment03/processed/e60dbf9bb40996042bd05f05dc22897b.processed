   Commemorate King's Legacy with #DreamDay
   In an effort to bring the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have A
   Dream" speech to life and commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March
   on Washington, NBC News is inviting you to complete the statement: "I
   have a dream that _______.
   On Wednesday, August 28, we're asking average Americans,
   opinion-makers, political leaders, celebrities, journalists and people
   around the world to share their dream through Twitter, Facebook,
   Instagram and Vine, using the hashtag #DreamDay.
   The video, photo and text submissions will be collected and featured on
   "TODAY," "NBC Nightly News" and uniquely spotlighted at
   NBCNews.com/DreamDay.
   We'll also dedicate special coverage in the days leading up to the
   anniversary, kicking off with "Meet the Press" on Sunday, Aug. 25. The
   program will rebroadcast of a rare interview with Martin Luther King,
   Jr. from 1963 â exactly 50 years ago and just days before the March on
   Washington. In addition, "Meet the Press" will focus the hour-long
   program on the theme of the "American Dream" featuring top political
   leaders with personal stories unique to the American experience.
