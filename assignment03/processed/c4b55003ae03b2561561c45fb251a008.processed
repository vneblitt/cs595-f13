Robin Quivers -- I've Been Fighting Cancer

   9/9/2013 6:08 AM PDT [29]BY TMZ STAFF
   Robin Quivers
   I've Been Fighting Cancer
   Breaking News
   [30]090913_robin_quivers_launch_v3
   Robin Quivers -- Howard Stern's right hand woman -- just announced
   she's been battling cancer for the past year ... but says she's now
   cancer free.
   Quivers says ... her cancer developed from endometrial tissue, which is
   tissue in the uterus.
   Robin says she underwent treatment for the past year -- including
   chemotherapy -- but says the treatment worked ... and doctors now
   believe she's cancer free.
   During the emotional segment on Howard's Sirius XM show, Howard said he
   still gets chills when listening to her story ... and admitted, "I
   gotta be honest, I thought she was a goner."
   Over the past year, Robin has not appeared in the studio, but she's
   been doing the show from home while undergoing treatment.
   Robin said doctors initially discovered a "mass" in her pelvis last
   year and decided to perform surgery to investigate the situation.
   Howard said Robin told him before the operation that doctors determined
   she had a cancerous tumor.
   Howard said he was "freaking out" when Robin went under the knife ...
   saying, "It was just a f**king crazy thing that came out of left
   field."
   Robin says her tumor was about the size of a grapefruit. She said it
   took doctors 8 hours to remove the tumor because it was so big.
   "Robin means more to me than anything," Howard said ... adding, "Seeing
   her go through this just f**king tore me up."
   Robin said she didn't feel alone at any part of her treatment ...
   because Howard was there for her the whole time.

   Robin's been on the show for most of the last year, just not in studio.
   They installed equipment so she could work from home. Good to know the
   recovery has gone well, though.

   Robin did not take time off from show. She broadcasted from her
   apartment via a ISDN line. Howard said this morning the missed 2 shows,
   a true professional broadcaster.

   why no comment on the 3.5 million dollar jersey house she just bought
   or how about a story how howard got his fans to buy Sirius and then
   went to "working" 2 days a week. bait and switch much? "we're not going
   to take commercials except to use the bathroom" . at least blobin
