Gray Said the Living Wage Bill Would Kill More Than 4,000 Jobs. What Are
They?

   Posted by [86]Aaron Wiener on Sep. 12, 2013 at 2:40 pm
   Skyland Town Center, where the city anticipated job losses if the
   living wage bill became law.

   Skyland Town Center, where the city anticipated job losses if the
   living wage bill became law.

   In Mayor Vince Gray's statement accompanying his [87]veto this morning
   of the living wage bill, Gray claimed the bill would have killed "more
   than 4,000 District jobs in just the first few years alone" (emphasis
   his). Gray attributed this number to Victor Hoskins, his deputy mayor
   for planning and economic development. But with Walmart threatening to
   scrap plans for only two stores, with perhaps a few hundred employees
   each, how did Hoskins arrive at that figure?

   Hoskins' spokeswoman, Chanda Washington, passes along the calculation
   that produced the number:

     Shops at Dakota Crossing - 300
     Walter Reed - 400
     St. Elizabeths - 300
     3 planned Walmarts - 1,125
     Retail stores around the planned Walmarts - 675
     3 Walmarts under construction - 900
     Potential anchor tenants that have expressed heavy interest - 650
     Total - 4,350

   Washington says these numbers represent both construction and permanent
   jobs that would be lost because retailers who would otherwise have
   opened stores in the District would choose not to in the presence of a
   living wage law. (The bill would require retailers in excess of 75,000
   square feet and with parent companies grossing at least $1 billion a
   year to pay a living wage of $12.50 an hour, minus benefits.)

   Walmart, then, represents less than a quarter of the total figure. But
   the Walmart number itself is questionable. The company was initially
   threatening to close three of it six planned D.C. stores, but one of
   those three stores already appears to be in trouble: The owners of the
   property recently [88]terminated their agreement with the developer,
   leaving the whole project--including the Walmart store--in
   doubt. Walmart spokesman Steven Restivo says the company remains
   "committed to building a store at the New York Avenue site and will
   continue to work towards bringing the project to fruition," but Walmart
   is at the mercy of the property owners and whatever future developer
   they select.

   Some of the other figures are more difficult to assess. At Walter Reed,
   for instance, no developer has been chosen, and at St. Elizabeths, the
   city hasn't even issued the solicitation for a developer, so it's a
   pure guessing game to try to predict how many jobs might be lost there
   as a result of the bill. The "retail stores around the planned
   Walmarts" category is a bit more concrete: The developer of the Skyland
   Town Center project [89]said the whole development couldn't continue if
   Walmart backed out, as it was threatening to do.

       Create 4350 jobs that can not support the residents occupying them?
       Where can you live in the DMV for the current minimum wage? Oh
       yeah, this mayor doesn't work for the poor people/mentally
       challenged/elderly, he just works for his NEW constituents. What he
       is doing is creating an imperalistic atmosphere that does not
       encourage good citizenship. If I am richer than you why should I
       respect you, poo hoo on out to the suburbs where I used to live,
       you don't deserve all these AMENITIES. Who wants to clean up after
       rich folks, who won't look at them in the street? Who wants to
       serve someone like that? Oh yeah, european immigrants who just need
       to get the right nanny position.... This city is becoming a
       cesspool of entitled, no class, DRUNKS!!!!

       They always fudge these numbers a bit.
       But what does it matter if it's 4500 jobs or 2000?
       A job is a job.
       And just as importantly is the massive influx of new taxes this
       would bring.
       Sales tax and the tax on the buildings alone would be in the tens
       of millions a year.
       And a lot of that goes to DC's never-ending welfare programs, so it
       absolutely goes directly to the poor.

       This is probably the first time I have agreed with VG there are
       many valid reasons this flawed election year ploy should be vetoed.
       If Walmart or any company wants to build multiple stores that is
       their decision the fact is they generate real property and sales
       tax.

       Walmart has said all along that they'd create 300 jobs per store.
       Yet when DMPED talks about losing jobs at three stores, they credit
       each store with a potential 375 jobs (for a total of 1,125 jobs).
       And DMPED mentions that most of these jobs will be part-time.
       According to my arithmetic, each part-time job counts as a fraction
       of a job. Their arithmetic also presumes that no other retailer
       will open in Walmart's stead, and thus all other ancillary tenants
       can be wiped off their balance sheet. This applies to discounting
       property and sales taxes as well. And finally, the biggest elephant
       in the room is that Walmart is a job-killer everywhere, all over
       America; Walmart's arrival ALWAYS kills jobs, and the net result is
       usually job loss. Hillman, you should get out more.

       Standing firm on treating DC Residents fairly doesn't lead to job
       loss, it's when people aren't prepared to take on the
       responsibilities of the job. There are plenty of jobs in the area,
       especially ones that pay the same scale of minimum wage that
       Wal-Mart will have to pay. People are just prideful and want their
       way all the time so they complain about what someone isn't doing
       for them instead of taking the necessary steps to improve their own
       situation.
       I just hope that since Gray has allowed for Wal-Mart and other big
       box retailers to come into the city and hire people for pennies and
       dimes, that they take pride in what they signed up for and maintain
       those establishments and communities to the highest degree.
       Skyland and South East overall have waited a long time for
       development. I just hope the residents step up to the plate and do
       their best to keep their revamped area in tact.

       Walmart is a job and business killer in small towns.
       But in DC? Not so much.
       Have you seen the businesses around these Walmarts currently?
       Almost all are service oriented - hair salons, liquor stores, sham
       medical facilities, gas stations.
       Walmart isnt their competition.
       The dynamics of Walmart going into a depressed urban area are
       totally different.
       The biggest plus is the massive groceries and pharmacies most of
       these Walmarts will have. In most of these locations the grocery
       options for residents are currently terrible.

       And dont misunderstand. Im not a huge Walmart fan. They treat their
       employees pretty bad and the quality of their stuff is usually
       horrible.
       I just think it's not quite as simple as saying they are the worst
       thing since 9/11.
