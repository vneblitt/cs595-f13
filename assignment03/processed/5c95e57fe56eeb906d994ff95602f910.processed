   Ten years ago, filmmaker Errol Morris sat down to interview Robert S.
   McNamara, the Secretary of Defense who'd molded the country's Vietnam
   War policies in the 1960s, for [50]the Oscar-winning documentary, The
   Fog of War. McNamara, one of the "best and brightest" minds from the
   Kennedy Administration, had come to regret some of his decisions, and
   his expansive conversation with Morris, conducted through an
   [51]Interrotron camera that allows the subject to look directly into
   the eyes of the audience, became a cautionary tale at a time when the
   country was revving up its war machine to take down Saddam Hussein in
   Iraq following the terrorist attacks on 9/11.

   One of the primary architects of that 2003 military campaign was Donald
   Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld had been the youngest Secretary of Defense in U.S.
   history when he held the position under Gerald Ford in the 1970s, and
   he became the oldest Secretary when he joined George W. Bush's cabinet
   in 2001. Rumsfeld was formidable, intimidating, and imperious, and
   [55]his press conferences were grand theater in which he made
   immediately infamous statements like, "You go to war with the army you
   have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time,"
   and, in reference to the existence of Iraqi WMDs, "The absence of
   evidence is not evidence of absence, or vice versa."

   Especially when the Iraqi War got ugly -- "Stuff happens," Rumsfeld
   said -- and photos of the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib were splashed on
   front pages around the world in 2004, Rumsfeld became the face of
   America's controversial policies in the Middle East. He resigned in
   2006, but he remains unwavering in his beliefs that the government did
   what it needed to do. There is no fog in Rumsfeld's war.

   Morris was surprised when Rumsfeld agreed to speak with him at all and
   even more surprised when he sat for 33 hours of on-camera interviews
   over the course of a year. The filmmaker calls those exchanges "one of
   the most difficult series of interviews that I've ever done."

   Morris spoke to EW at the Toronto Film Festival, where The Unknown
   Known screened.

   ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How does one begin to court Donald Rumsfield for
   a project like this? Not why, but how?
   ERROL MORRIS: I wrote him a letter. I‚d become aware of all of his
   memos -- called yellow perils in the Ford Administration, snowflakes
   during the Bush Administration. And the idea of all these memos
   fascinated me. I contacted his attorney slash agent, [56]Bob Barnett --
   he's legendary. He sells most of these huge inside-the-beltway books.
   Bob Barnett told me, ‚Well, he's never going to talk to you.‚ And I
   asked, ‚Well, will you forward a letter and a copy of The Fog of War?‚
   He said he would. In the letter, I explicitly told Don Rumsfeld that I
   was not envisioning a Fog of War 2. I felt: different men, different
   set of historical circumstances, different issues. So I met with him in
   his offices -- which was one of the more extraordinary events for me.
   You know, Rumsfeld coming to the door, introducing himself, saying,
   ‚Don Rumsfeld.‚

   Did you get the impression he watched Fog of War?
   Whether he watched it in its entirety, I don't know. But he said he
   didn't like it. He said that guy [McNamara] has nothing to apologize
   for.

   When you first met Rumsfeld, did you get the impression there was a
   certain amount of performance in his being `Rumsfeld'?
   It's one of the great mysteries, not just of Don Rumsfeld but of all of
   us. To what extent are our lives performance? Are we sincere? I think a
   lot of people would like to believe that he's really truly insincere.
   That he is just a consummate performer and liar. That's a received view
   among many, and he's a person hated, in truth. He's hated by the Left.
   He's hated by the Right. He's probably hated by the Middle, for all I
   know.

   How did that first meeting go?
   He was very, very friendly to me -- and has been very friendly to me,
   through all of this. He showed me various things in the office, various
   artifacts. Copies of the election ballots from Afghanistan; a crumpled
   piece of metal, which was a piece of an anti-ballistic missile missile
   -- saying, ‚Who says you can't shoot down a missile with a missile.‚
   Then he invited me -- this was the oddest and most interesting part of
   that meeting -- he invited me to sit in his conference room while he
   was doing phoners for his [memoir, Known and Unknown] with reporters.
   It seemed odd because, yes, I'm asking him for an interview, but I'm
   now all of a sudden sitting next to him with a cup of coffee and
   listening to him being interviewed by other reporters. And I found it
   really really interesting.

   How was it revealing?
   It was revealing about him and the whole process of journalism and
   reporting. The reporters all asked the same questions. And he gave the
   same answers, almost like someone was pushing a button in a vending
   machine. And the questions you can even imagine. I bet if I asked you
   to imagine what those questions were, you would nail it. It reinforced
   this idea that this is not what I should do. This is not the way to
   produce something different or new. Also, I had this crazy idea, which
   was taking one person and building a story around them. I sometimes say
   that art for me is you set up a system of arbitrary rules and then
   follow them slavishly. So you exclude everybody else, and instead of a
   film like, for example, [57]the Cheney film that was recently made-

   R.J. Cutler's film.
   R.J. Cutler's film, which is a really interesting, really powerful, but
   not atypical film, where you have a brief interview with Cheney, and
   you interview a good number of other people about Cheney. There are
   some powerful moments in that film, but what I'm interested is the
   inside-out. I'm not interested in what X or Y or Z thinks about Don
   Rumsfeld. I'm interested in what Don Rumsfeld thinks about Don
   Rumsfeld. I'm interested in how he sees himself and what he did. And
   the memos are a way in. I thought this was fantastic: he will read his
   actual memos. I'm sure there are a lot of memos that are still
   classified, but we saw a lot of memos and we were allowed to pick and
   choose. He was willing, more or less, to read anything, as long as he
   had written it.

   In the film, you eventually ask him point blank -- and he kind of
   demurs -- but did you ever get a sense of what he was hoping to get out
   of this?
   I think people need to tell their life story to another person. They
   need to give an accounting of themselves. Maybe it's some very basic
   human need. Someone said to me -- and I don‚t know whether this is true
   or not, but I liked hearing it -- that he was obviously engaged by me.

   That makes some sense because he'd just published a book and I'm sure
   he had plenty of platforms or outlets to tell his story, like an hour
   on 60 Minutes. He chose you. You made some impression.
   Yeah, I think so. I told him in the first meeting that we shouldn't
   even talk about a contract. What I wanted to do, I wanted to spend two
   days interviewing him -- as many hours as he wanted to give me. I would
   edit it. I would show it to him. If he wanted to proceed, we'd sign a
   contract. If he wanted to stop, we could stop and that material would
   never see the light of day. And it was a gentleman's agreement that I
   would've honored. And he came up to Boston. We shoot two days of
   interviews. I edited them. I showed it to him. He called me to talk
   about the material that I had sent to him. He said, ‚You know, I have a
   serious problem with this material.‚ I said, ‚Oh.‚ He said, "I just
   don't like that tie I was wearing. Could we change it?‚

   He was being serious?
   I don't know. I don't really know.

   After the Toronto screening, you told the audience that he ultimately
   saw four versions of the film, and true to his habits, he had notes for
   you.
   Oh, absolutely.

   Were his notes more about the content of the footage or your
   presentation?
   Both, but I would say by and large they were about the content of the
   footage. Sometimes he just didn't like the kinds of imagery that I used
   or the music that I used. But often they were specific complaints about
   how I had represented various historical facts. He wanted me to state
   somewhere in the movie that the early [Iraq] policies of the Bush
   Administration were no different from Clinton's policies. Well, I do
   not believe this is true and I explained to him why I didn't believe it
   was true. You see, part of the danger if you don't know this history
   well, is perhaps many of these things will slide past you. [In a memo]
   he says that this policy of containment -- the no-fly zones -- isn't
   working. He says that we tried to keep [Saddam Hussein] in the box;
   he's crawled some distance out of the box. Sooner or later, we're going
   to have to confront a Saddam armed with nuclear weapons, et cetera, et
   cetera. He's really dramatic. This is a direct reference to Clinton's
   policies and Clinton's policies not working and the necessity to do
   something different. So I said, in good conscience, ‚I can't do that.
   Your memo itself states that this is different than what went before,
   that those policies were ineffective, weren't working and had to be
   changed.‚ So I left it more or less the way it was. In some instances,
   I tried to make changes -- not slavishly, but because I felt it was the
   correct or the right thing to do. In other instances, I did not.
   Because I think that some of these memos are so revealing, so
   unbelievably fascinating, and I would have to say disturbing.

   After the screening the other night, I almost got the impression that
   you still found Rumsfeld‚s semantic contradictions and wordplay
   irritating.
   I would put it differently. There's something sort of strange about a
   world of homilies and rules, all based on weird contradictions. In the
   very beginning of the film, he says, ‚Preparing for war can be a cause
   of war... but failure to prepare for war can also be a cause for war.‚
   And I say to him, "But you know from that, you can just prove anything,
   you can justify everything." I feel I've been really hard on Rumsfeld
   in the interviews that I've given, but I am appreciative that he did
   this with me and find him endlessly fascinating. I took note of when he
   corrects me in the movie, when I said, "Why do you‚¶" He's absolute
   right. It is about us, whether we want to own him or disown him, agree
   with him ideologically or disagree with him ideologically, he's part of
   our country and he's part of our heritage and part of who we are at
   this juncture in history.

   ‚¶and what our government is still doing.
   And what our government is still doing. We live in a Rumsfeld world.
