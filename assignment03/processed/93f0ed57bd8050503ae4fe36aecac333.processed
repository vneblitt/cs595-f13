   Researchers to Sequence Genomes of Newborns

   Randomized trial is the first to explore the benefits and risks of
   genome sequencing in newborns.
   By TOM LANGFORD
   September 5, 2013

   Parents of some Boston-area newborns will have a rare opportunity to
   have their baby's DNA completely analyzed as part of the first-ever
   randomized trial to explore the benefits and risks of genome sequencing
   (reading the entirety of a person's DNA) in this age group.

   The five-year study will assess the baby's risks of future diseases and
   how that information affects the baby's medical care, and the
   relationship between the parents, baby and baby's pediatrician.

   The study is funded by a $6 million grant from the National Institutes
   of Health to [89]Brigham and Women's Hospital and [90]Boston Children's
   Hospital. It will be led equally by [91]Robert C. Green, Harvard
   Medical School associate professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's
   Hospital and [92]Alan Beggs, the Sir Edwin and Lady Manton Professor of
   Pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital.

   as a resource to aid in the baby's medical care. Image courtesy of
   Brigham and Women's Hospital "This first-of-its-kind study will
   accelerate the use of genomics in clinical pediatric medicine by
   creating and safely testing novel methods for integrating sequencing
   into the care of newborns," said Green, a medical geneticist in the
   Division of Genetics at Brigham and Women's Hospital and director of
   the [93]Genomes2People Research Program.

   "We will implement and study a futuristic goal: that genomic
   information examined shortly after birth can serve as a resource
   throughout infancy and childhood to inform clinical care and identify
   appropriate and timely interventions," he said.

   Beginning in early 2014, the study will enroll 480 newborns and their
   parents in order to compare outcomes that occur when genomic newborn
   sequencing is added to the conventional newborn screening that babies
   currently receive.

   The volunteers, healthy newborns from Brigham and Women's Hospital and
   infants from Boston Children's Hospital's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,
   will be divided into two groups.  One group will receive conventional
   state-mandated newborn screening, the other will receive conventional
   screening and genome sequencing.

   Researchers will collect and analyze the genomic sequences, which may
   include information on potential causes of any birth defects,
   predispositions to future medical conditions and predictions about
   responses to certain drugs, and will return that information to parents
   and pediatricians to evaluate the medical, psychosocial and economic
   outcomes.

   "These analyses will help illuminate the full spectrum of benefits and
   risks associated with genome sequencing of newborns," said Beggs,
   director of the [94]Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research and a
   professor of pediatrics and scientist in the Division of Genetics at
   Boston Children's Hospital.

   This research project follows the start of a similar NIH-funded study
   at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the [95]MedSeq Project, which is the
   first NIH-funded randomized clinical trial to study the integration of
   whole genome sequencing into the practice of adult medicine. The Manton
   Center at Boston Children's is a multidisciplinary center for research
   into the causes and prevention of rare "orphan" diseases that is
   working with [96]Claritas Genomics to develop genomic testing to
   enhance pediatric health.

   Beggs said, "Synergies between the MedSeq Project, the Manton Center,
   and this newborn sequencing project we are calling the BabySeq Project
   will help us discover how best to integrate genomic sequencing into
   medical care to benefit all adults, children and their families."

   Enrollment in the study will begin after researchers receive approval
   from their institutional review boards.

   In addition to Green and Beggs, the project will be co-led by a
   multidisciplinary team of investigators in pediatrics, neonatology,
   genetics, psychology, ethics and newborn screening.
