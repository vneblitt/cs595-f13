   StackOverflow took the place of news/dejanews for me. It's a first
   place to stop whenever I have trouble with just about any piece of
   software or writing software, usually the answer is right there on the
   first place in a fairly easy to digest form. Along with wikipedia and
   the Khan academy it is a fantastic resource.

   Amazing it is only 5 years old, it feels like it has been around
   forever, I recall coming across it for the first time while still in
   Canada and thinking 'this is neat'. I never contributed which is really
   a miss on my part but I try to keep the number of accounts that I have
   to an absolute minimum and stackoverflow is plenty useful as it is
   today. I really should do some community service there one of these
   days, it is only fair.

   Hard to imagine that even google could not rescue usenet (or rather,
   dejanews) from the spam and the trolls.

   Wholeheartedly agree about the "feels like it has been around forever",
   which to me is the mark of a product which has changed the game. I
   simply can't recall what life was like before it. Conservatively
   speaking, I'm probably a good 2-3x as productive as I was pre SO.

   The only Q&A I can recall before StackOverflow was finding answers on a
   message board _or_ finding the answers hidden behind a pay-wall. (e.g:
   ExpertsExchange, which I believe has been around since the 90s.)

   StackOverflow was definitely a game-changer.

   the EE answers were never really behind a paywall, simply they were so
   hidden at the bottom of the page that a normal user did had the idea to
   scroll fully. After all, they needed to present the information to the

   They did that for a while, but Google implemented a policy that what
   gets shown to the Googlebot has to be the same as what a user would
   actually see. EE got delisted from Google for violating that policy,
   and ever since then, they have the answer way at the bottom of the page
   no matter what.

   >> I never contributed which is really a miss on my part

   I love StackOverflow. However, I think the worst part of Stack Overflow
   is how hard it is to contribute as a new member. You need to build up
   reputation points and they can be very hard to get. Questions get
   'sniped', answers get deleted or buried, and very often when you help
   another new user out, they never return to the site to accept your
   answer. It's very frustrating to take the time to answer a question and
   not receive any feedback.

   The best way "in" as a newcomer is to have some knowledge that no one
   else has. In my case my first good answer (although it took months to
   get any rep at all) was an obscure bit of paypal sandbox knowledge. I
   actually came across the knowledge first, and since the problem I had
   hadn't been solved via StackOverflow I searched SO for the same problem
   I had been having and updated the old question with my new found
   solution.

   That has since earned me 50 rep. This along with a few other bits took
   me to the 200 threshold which then gives 100 rep across all
   stackexchange sites. (Enough to upvote/comment.)

   But the fact that "newbies" can't contribute what in all honestly is
   largely going to be misinformation or "me too" answers is also part of
   the genius, it gives real answers breathing room and keeps spam out.

   My question asking has been less successful. I've asked 2 questions,
   one of which had no response whatsoever, and the other had an answer
   which answered the question in the community's mind but because I had
   been slack with my terminology didn't answer the issue I was really
   having.

   Definitely. Most of my rep is from Prolog answers. I can spend an hour
   on a lengthy, detailed answer, and the best I can hope for is <4 votes
   and (maybe) an acceptance. Average return on an answer is probably 20
   rep. OTOH, if I squeak a Haskell answer in, average is more like 50-100
   rep because there's simply a lot more eyes on Haskell answers. At the
   same time, this means while there's a good hour or two window between a
   Prolog question being asked, it's more like 2 minutes for a Haskell
   question. The community is just really good like that. So there's a
   limiting factor problem there. Competition for MySQL and Postgres
   answers is also really high so you have to be really fast with your
   answering, but all my "greatest hits" were in Postgres.

   Question-askers benefit the most from this competitiveness, but without
   a niche it would be really hard to break in. For a little while it
   seemed like people were starting to treat S.O. activity as a test of
   your virtue or capabilities as a programmer. Today it seems absurd to
   judge someone for not having an account. It's just too hard to get
   started.

   Interesting, you talk about the competition, breaking in, monitoring
   unanswered questions so you can answer first, etc... - What's the
   motivation behind it?

   I guess it is not just contributing to the common knowledge, but maybe
   to show off your profile to potential employers or similar?

   For me, I just like being helpful. The rep is nice too. Stupid internet
   points are pretty motivational, but I also review edits, and you don't
   get any rep for that. I would be flattered if an employer had noticed
   me on there, but I don't think it's likely to happen. I've been active
   on SO for longer than I've been active here, but I have gotten many
   friendly recruitment emails from here and none from there.

   Prolog is an extremely small niche. Most of the questions are pretty
   basic and from students. I don't like seeing students being told odd
   things about Prolog, with a dismissive air of "Prolog makes no sense,
   you just have to feed it this nonsense to make it go." So another part
   of my motivation is to keep this sad religion alive and inviting.
   Haskell has a much larger community of people working very hard to make
   it inviting.

   The hiring angle probably works better for other niches. Every Java EE
   question is answered by BalusC. I imagine that pays dividends for his
   consulting: he's the most helpful guy in that area and I'd hire him in
   a second if I were in charge of that kind of thing.

   Rep on SO is unpredictable.

   For example I randomly answered a question outside of my primary domain
   because it was a relatively easy issue that I had encountered myself. I
   have since earned close to 2,000 rep from that simple answer alone and
   get 20-50 points a week from it despite it being over 2 years old.

   On the other hand answers that I spent way too much time researching
   have hardly attracted any points at all.

   Same experience here. Quick, one or two line answers to simple, common
   questions seem to do the best.

   Although, those questions that I've poured the most time into and
   really tried to answer thoroughly are my favorites. Especially if it's
   something I had to do a bunch of research and/or testing to confirm.
   The lack of feedback is supplanted by the quenching of the thirst to
   learn something new. In fact, this quenching is my favorite part of the
   SE sites.

   it's got harder for everyone. i'm over 10k and mine isn't going up

   many have been asked, but also because the sites have fragmented and

   I worked my reputation up to nearly 2000 at the start and then
   gradually fell off with considerable disgust.

   Part of it is that it seems that within a year, the good questions were
   pretty much answered. It's notable that in the first year, especially
   the first six months, the site was carefully curated and had a friendly
   feel to it.

   In the present SO, answering questions has become a matter of getting
   your low-quality answer to a low-quality question out extremely quickly
   or having some pretty obscure technical knowledge (even then, you're
   going to get karma only for obscure knowledge, not for a quality
   answer). And, yeah, I suppose you game things by creating a question
   similar to an existing high karma question (and this stuff also lowers
   average site quality too since the best answers kind of hide within ten
   similar questions).

   Further, SO ironically turns out to be much useful when you Google than
   when you ask your own questions - questions beyond a given difficulty
   go wanting even if you give a high Karma reward. It seems the smart
   answers just skim for simplistic questions rather than spending time on
   any hard questions.

   It seems like SO is now just kind of a low-quality-question fest
   because they've got a troove of good answers from their first year of
   existence.

   I mean, one can claim hn has declined but any decline in hn is a
   thousand times less than the way StackOverflow has tanked as a site
   (but it's still great for googling all the good answers from
   yesteryear. When you're doing that, take note of the answer's dates,
   btw, I believe that it revealing).

   I disagree. I have 5K rep, I am not quite a newbie myself so I rarely

   site launch so I did put in a few questions. When I've asked a tricky
   MySQL question someone came in like ten minutes, produced a working
   answer, soon edited to add a fiddle. The dude is programming almost
   longer than I am alive! I asked a regexp question -- someone with over
   50k answered that. Where else would you find free advice like that? SO

   The purpose of Stack Overflow is not to serve the people who ask the
   questions, that's just a happy side-effect. The purpose is to create a
   resource to serve future Googlers.

   There are less broadly-interesting new questions in areas of
   established technology, but that's fine: there's less need for new
   questions in areas that the site already serves well. Stack Overflow is
   not having any trouble getting good questions about new technology as

   Well, that's because a lot of people use SO as either "do my homework

   But under the pile of this manure, real content is still there, real
   people with knowledge still answer real questions. But I admit it has
   become harder to contribute - even in areas that I have considerable
   knowledge, most questions aren't either interesting or worth the time,
   and those that are I'd be missing since I can't keep up with the inflow
   of low-value questions. I wonder if SO has any ideas how to fix it...

   No, not really, not in a density that makes it worth it from anyone. I
   mean I looked hard at several points for question answerers as well as
   attempting to be one. You yourself admit the place broken by the end of
   your post.

   The obvious thing is that good answers that involve effort on the part
   of the answerer generally don't get you anything like the appropriate
   Karma.

   Even more, SO actually reduced the amount of Karma you could get by
   asking questions so there's nothing to distinguish good questions from
   crap questions.

   That's the kind of annoying part about trying to answer questions.
   Anything requiring a relatively modest amount of knowledge gets
   answered in seconds. Try to type up something good and comprehensive
   with links to documentation and all, and there will probably be 4 other
   answers by the time you're done. And a lot of the moderately
   challenging or obscure things have been asked and answered already.

   Meanwhile, if you actually manage to answer or document some tricky,
   obscure thing, then often it never gets enough traffic to earn much
   reputation. Mine is still pretty low, but my highest-rep answer is a
   one-liner, telling somebody that Mercurial can't track files outside of
   the repository root directory structure. Meanwhile, an actual
   challenging, obscure answer, like the one on running ASP.NET with C++
   dlls (hint: avoid if at all possible) gets very little.

   Asking good questions helps too, but I usually find it faster to look
   it up or figure it out myself than to format a decent question and wait
   for responses.

   Well this is a feature if you are looking at SO as a place to get
   answers. There are far more people looking for answers (by asking OR
   searching) to the basic simple questions.

   So if you leave a good answer on something basic and simple, you have
   provided utility to far more people than if you are leaving a detailed
   answer to an obscure question.

   This, incidentally, is what's lacking in the IRC channels of open
   source projects. In an IRC channel, questions that are not hard enough
   get ignored because they are not interesting to the experts in the
   channel.

   So the IRC channel is good if you are hacking on the core, while SO is
   good if you are just trying to get something done, and the technology
   in question is a small part of your entire stack.

   Patience in online discussions is probably the most valuable (and
   definitely the most unexpected) thing I've gained from spending time on
   SO.

   Coming from a more traditional forum, I originally expected questions
   that had a highly-upvoted or "marked" answer to essentially be over and
   done with - the majority of people will already have read the thread,
   so relatively few new votes will come in...

   ...But after five years, I've had ample opportunity to realize this is
   a flawed way to look at threads - questions - when the vast majority of
   readers come in via Google in the months and years following its
   asking.

   Being quick on the draw can be fun, but being useful is what nets you
   the most attention long-term. Folks with real problems tend to keep
   reading until an answer actually solves them. And the race is not
   always to the swift...

   This is why, despite using the site since the beginning, I don't have

   If you have no time or incentive to share your knowledge (which is
   totally OK), maybe staying anonymous is just the right strategy.

   Still, to ask a question you have to have only 1 rep point. A really
   good question or two can get you 100-200 rep in just a few hours. Try
   it if when you have a good question at hand.

   StackOverflow is intensely competitive when it comes to answering new
   questions on your favorite tags.

   So you could just post answers to problems you debugged on your own and

   Interesting. I have an opposite view - for me it was easier to find
   answers before SO. One good example is when you need to get a library
   recommendation (which is quite a useful thing for a programmer). "SO is
   Q&A site and doesn't do library recommendations" (literal quote from
   someone who has closed such a question). The problem is that most of
   the programmers nowadays hang on SO, so other sites (where such
   questions would be allowed) have much less audience than they did
   pre-SO. Sure, I can disguise the question and hope that I will get
   library recommendations nevertheless, but that's an (ugly) hack.

   There are countless other examples where well-researched, popular and
   in some way contributing questions were shot down because they are
   unfit for SO.

   And as others have pointed out, most karma comes from answers to
   popular questions, which rewards generic questions which probably have
   tons of similar answers across the Internet. Domain specific answers
   however are less awarding.

   I cope with that in my way. I ask the questions and treat fairly all
   who answer / comment, but I hold myself back when I see a question I
   know the answer to. Why would I answer and help SO? I really hope some
   alternative arises so I can share my knowledge there, but until then I
   will just try to survive with SO. And what "if all did that"? Well, I
   guess the alternative would come much sooner. I wouldn't be unhappy
   about it, far from it.

   "SO is Q&A site and doesn't do library recommendations" (literal quote
   from someone who has closed such a question)"

   Yeah SO is going the way of Wikipedia wrt rule nazi, trigger happy
   editors, it's very frustrating. Especially since many of those
   'editors' have gotten much of their brownie points from farming them
   through answering 'soft' questions with popular answers, asking
   beginner-level but popular questions etc. When you look at the profiles
   of those voting for closing in cases like the one you cite, you very
   often see that their domain knowledge is very limited.

   I've been sort of active on the site since the very beginning which has
   led me to have a few thousand points there. To my big frustration, a
   large part of them come from two answers: one in which I recommended
   the K&R for learning C, and another how to use the @ operator in PHP to
   suppress warning messages. I'm a bit disheartened every time I get yet
   another vote for those answers.

   Anyway, what I was going to say was that I get the impression that when
   I ask or answer a question from that account (with several thousand
   points and active for 5 years), I'm treated differently than people on
   new accounts with few points, even when their question is worded
   exactly the same way I'd do it. It feels like bullying by low-quality
   users who through grinding stumbled upon editing powers. It certainly
   (mostly) stopped me from contributing a year or 2 ago; not even so much
   for the morality of it, but more the overall idea that a site run by
   the distinctly mediocre (even if there are a few very high quality
   contributors) just doesn't give me great confidence in the quality of
   what is on there.

   Of course this is a widely documented phenomenon with any UGC (hey
   there's a buzzword we haven't heard since 2009!) site after it hits a
   certain critical mass, we just have to look at the very site we're
   reading now...

   Nice to know I am not the only one - I have a similar answer that
   brings me enough points I can see my reputation safely (and

   However my biggest problem with SO is actually that it is narrow in
   scope, but due to its success other (broader reaching) sites don't have
   enough users. I still hope they will change their policies to allow
   broader (still well-researched) questions, but I am not holding my

   That's a good point. I never really got the 'not relevant' bit. After
   all, if a question was worth asking it was worth answering (there is no
   such thing as a stupid question or an irrelevant one, there are stupid
   answers though. The closest thing to an irrelevant question (or a
   stupid one) is a question that wasn't asked...).

   SO would not suffer unduly from letting these not relevant questions be
   asked and answered anyway. Relevant Questions are like beauty, they are
   in the eye of the beholder.

   I think that's where they disagree with you. Stack Overflow aims to
   keep discussions as minimal as possible and is not the place to weigh
   the pros and cons of programming language X against that of programming
   language Y. If you want more information, they cover their take on the
   issue in great depth on their podcasts (which are great to listen to,
   regardless).

   I like what they've done. By closing all bad questions and a few good
   questions the site contains only good questions. The obvious downside
   is that the occasional interesting question is removed, but I think the
   trade-offs are worth it. And judging by the popularity of the site, I
   think most everyone else does too, even if they're not consciously
   aware of it.

   SO would suffer, because the kind of question you're talking about is
   intrinsically debatable. Those questions aren't bad or wrong, but they
   are inappropriate for the medium of SO, which is about technical
   questions with concrete answers. SO is not the be-all, end-all of

   If it isn't obvious to you I doubt anybody will be able to "prove" it
   to your satisfaction. Besides, you can't create rules around impossible
   conditions like "close any question which will lead to endless debate"
   so instead you create rules around easily detected conditions like
   "close any question that isn't concrete."

   I don't greatly love SO (though I like it more than I used to) but
   there are lots of alternatives that lack SO's irksome limitations
   (slant.co comes to mind). By now it is obvious that whether you like
   SO's formula or not, it clearly works.

   A "not relevant" question is usually not a "bad" question, but just a
   question that can't have a good, definitive answer. SO are trying to be
   a site hosting such answers, not discussions.

   So opinion-based questions are explicitly unwelcome on SO. They can
   collect lots of worthy information in comments, so such questions are
   usually closed but not deleted.

   SO even tried to channel the discussions by developing discourse.org so

   I share that feeling, but I also have to restrain it in the face of the

   least not open-ended discussion. It's about getting expert answers to
   focused questions, not polling for data or asking opinions.

   However, I really wish someone would build and maintain a "Stack

   I suspect that the Stack Overflow community would agree that there's
   value in those conversations. And they'd also assert that they belong
   somewhere else, since Stack Overflow questions are meant to have right
   answers.

   My complaint is that almost every web-related javascript question is
   answered with "jQuery". I didn't ask about jquery, I asked about
   javascript god damnit. I understand it's the right answer in many
   cases, but the full answer should be: "You can do it like this or much
   easier using library like jQuery".

   But then you have the power to make it abundantly clear that you don't
   want answers that depend on jQuery. If you do get a "but you can do
   this with jQuery" without also supplying a pure javascript answer, then
   downvote.

   Then all you gotta do is ask for them. Just tag your question as
   `javascript` and ask for a "pure javascript" solution.

   It probably doesn't work. It's like lots of Windows batch file
   questions get answered with "install cygwin and then use this arcane
   invocation". Given that I'm one of the few who who can competently
   answer such questions without installing anything else (with a slightly
   more arcane invocation) I often find that a little sad. I almost
   thought about going around answering Unix shell scripting questions
   with PowerShell answers, but Pash isn't that far yet.

   True. But many questions that come up, that were already answered. And
   for years jQuery was fancy and most answers to JS questions are that
   way. Only recently people start to use pure vanilla JS 5. Thankfully
   the community adds new pure JS answers to old questions... though you
   have to scroll down to the bottom of the page.

   It's worse than that, there's pretty much no effective way to use the
   site to learn about a topic. It's a very effective Q&A site but that's
   all it is; it was meant to be slightly more but has never managed to
   achieve that. I'd say there's a very big opportunity in there for
   anyone who wants to try to compete.

   Actually, I've used Stack Overflow to learn things by trying answering
   questions I don't know much about. Most of the time I don't succeed in
   answering them, but I always find out a lot while trying to
   research/figure it out.

   I'm sure this won't get me any love, but I worked at Experts-Exchange
   at one point, and it's not the horrible place SO and Jeff Atwood have
   painted it as.

   Spammy marketing tactics? Sure. Is SO better? Absolutely. But in the
   process of building SO, Jeff and company have basically trashed EE's
   name, and after seeing EE from the inside I'm one of the rare few who
   don't think EE is evil incorporated.

   Eh, I hated EE long before I came across SO or heard of Jeff Atwood. My

   useful they sounded.

   When it first arrived on the scene it was much like quora is now and I
   loved that. But then they started trying to trick people into signing
   up, etc. It just went from awesome to dagnabbit quickly. So when there
   was one place to find a bunch of other programmers that popped up, I
   jumped on it.

   EE's business model was built in the early days of the internet, and
   before SO came around they had lots of paying customers. "Tricking
   people to sign up" was really just their attempt at monetizing content.
   It clearly did not pan out to be the best long-term strategy, but when
   you already have thousands of paying customers, it gets pretty
   difficult to "open up" to the general public vs. a company like SO
   which started open and monetized in other ways (Careers).

   It's not necessary to be evil in your heart to nevertheless do things
   that are evil or have very negative consequences. EE was classic bait
   and switch. Moreover, they monetized cloud sourced answers without
   adding anything of value to the equation (compare this to stackexchange
   which put a lot of R&D into a system that facilitated better quality
   answers and also goes out of their way to keep their content open).
   Certainly that's not the worst crime anyone has ever committed but it's
   very scummy and has had a very real negative impact on a lot of
   people's lives. Thinking that the solution to your problem is available
   when it's not or finding out that it's behind a paywall (without even
   knowing if the "answer" actually works) is very disheartening.

   Sorry, but this characterization is plain wrong. The experts on EE got
   VIP treatment when I was there, and they were getting good consulting
   work as a result of their answers.

   EE also had teams working on improving the question/answer experience
   long before SO came around. I'd agree that SO is better now, but to say
   "no value added" is applying a blanket statement that isn't true.

   EE's business model ended up losing out in the long term, but that's
   all that really happened. The characterizations and generalizations
   made about EE are pretty silly when you take a hard look at it.

   To be honest, I really enjoyed EE. I answered enough questions to earn
   VIP and even had shirts and things sent to me.

   However I ended up letting my experience lapse, and I lost my VIP
   status and from then on I was bummed. If you aren't a VIP I couldn't
   imagine ever paying to see the answers.

   If you were a VIP then the experience on EE was similar to SO.
