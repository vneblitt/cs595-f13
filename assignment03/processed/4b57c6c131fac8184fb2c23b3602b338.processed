Shadow of a Doubt D.C. statehood activists have failed for decades. Why do
they think $1 million in public funds will help?

   As civil rights activists returned to the Lincoln Memorial on a
   Saturday in late August to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
   March on Washington, a smaller event for statehood for the District of
   Columbia took place not far from the Reflecting Pool.

   At that rally, held at the District's World War I Memorial, elderly
   activists from the city's Statehood Green Party mixed with
   20-somethings trying to make statehood sexy. "Want a date?" one young
   woman's sign read. "Make D.C. a state."

   Speakers around the memorial played go-go by the genre's godfather,
   Chuck Brown. The rally's theme song, though, was "Stand Up 4 DC," which
   mashes up statehood rhetoric and elevator music to surprising success.
   "Home Rule was cool, but man I ain't no fool," the song goes. "I need
   control of my own destiny."

   The event drew a few hundred people, including Mayor Vince Gray and
   Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who gave a speech that included asking for
   her own vote in Congress. One D.C. Council staffer nearby remarked that
   Norton must be familiar with the speech. "She's been giving it for 40
   years," he says.

   The District's shadow delegation also took the podium. The elected
   shadow senators and shadow representative are treated like congressmen
   by the District's government, at least officially. In Congress,
   however, they get treatment just a little better than every other
   volunteer lobbyists.

   Shadow Sens. Paul Strauss and Michael D. Brown were able to address the
   crowd for about 10 minutes, but when shadow Rep. Nate Bennett-Fleming
   reached the podium, the delegation's time was up. The organizers, who
   were apparently more committed to respecting their schedule than the
   shadow delegation, played Bennett-Fleming off like an Oscar winner in a
   technical category.

   There was one notable absence from the rally: the out-of-town March on
   Washington visitors the District wanted to win over. Organizers tried
   to lure marchgoers with tourist maps of D.C. peppered with paragraphs
   about statehood, but at the fork in the security cordon between the
   local rally and the official March on Washington, most opted for the
   latter.

   In the end, the rally may have been most memorable for Ward 8
   Councilmember Marion Barry seizing the microphone and insisting on his
   own time for a speech. After weathering organizers' attempts to cut his
   mic, the mayor-for-life delivered a call-and-response list of issues
   that statehood would solve.

   "I say jobs, say statehood," Barry told the thinning crowd.

   "Statehood!"

   "Black people, stop killing each other!" Barry said.

   "Statehood!"

   "Mothers on welfare!" Barry said.

   "Statehood!"

   "Statehood, statehood, statehood," Barry finished.

   After decades of failed attempts, statehood has become--to paraphrase
   Homer Simpson's description of beer--the cause of and the solution to
   all of the District's problems. No money-suck program can be cut off if
   its existence makes the District look more like a state, and no
   politician can go wrong supporting it. At the same time, any
   theoretical budget shortfall can be solved, somehow, by the commuter
   tax statehood would allow the District to impose.

   Despite statehood's rhetorical prominence, though, the District invests
   little in lobbying, in part because of federal budget riders that
   forbade it until 2008. That could change this fall, with At-Large
   Councilmember Vincent Orange's District of Columbia Statehood Advocacy
   Act of 2013. Orange's legislation would spend more than $1.1 million on
   statehood, including giving the delegation their first
   salaries--$35,000 for each member. That doesn't compare to Norton's
   salary ($174,000), Gray's ($200,000), or the average councilmember's
   ($128,202), but it's enough to make the shadow delegation more than a
   pricey hobby for its members. With the District about to put money
   behind the delegation, it's time to look at how the statehood fight got
   to this point--and whether D.C. should spend more than a million
   dollars on a cause that's spent a long time going nowhere.
     __________________________________________________________________

   District residents voted for their first shadow delegation in 1990, the
   culmination of an idea supported by statehood activists and the Rev.
   Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. (Jackson would be one of the first
   two shadow senators elected.) The vote took place over the objections
   of several members of the D.C. Council. "We need shadow reps like we
   need potholes," then-Councilmember Carol Schwartz wrote in a Washington
   Post op-ed.

   The plan was inspired by Tennessee, which had elected its own shadow
   delegation in 1796 to push for statehood. The so-called Tennessee Plan
   had already been used successfully by Alaska and Hawaii earlier in the
   20th century. Its application in the District is murkier, though, since
   none of the future states that successfully used it had their lack of
   statehood detailed in the Constitution. Still, if all went according to
   plan, the delegation would make itself obsolete in a few years.

   Three years after the creation of the shadow delegation, though,
   another statehood bill died in the Senate. And starting in 1995, Newt
   Gingrich's Republican-controlled House meant a total halt on statehood
   progress. Gingrich declared D.C. a "laboratory" for GOP ideas,
   appointed a Republican task force on the District, and set to work
   pushing tax cuts and school vouchers. John Capozzi, the shadow
   representative from 1995 to 1997, recalls that the most exciting time
   of his term came when he tried--and failed--to crash a congressional
   orientation to get a free laptop.

   The lack of progress on statehood inspired a more incremental approach
   focused on gaining voting rights for Norton. The most active outfit was
   DC Vote, a lobbying group that some statehood activists felt was overly
   favored by the city government. Years of negotiating meant to convince
   Republicans to accept a House vote for the District in exchange for
   another one for conservative Utah came to nothing in 2010, even though
   a bill to do that passed the House. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
   allowed Republican senators--and some Democrats worried about their
   legislative grades from the National Rifle Association--to attach an
   amendment to the bill that would have taken away the District's control
   over its own gun laws. Norton, pushed along by a D.C. Council
   resolution trashing the compromise, refused to take the deal, and it
   died in the Senate.

   Statehood regained its position as the favored goal for the District
   that same year, with the failure of the voting rights bill. "That's
   when statehood became part of the movement again," says
   Bennett-Fleming. But the antipathy between statehood and voting rights
   activists is still fresh. Incoming DC Vote executive director Kimberly
   Perry ran afoul of statehood activists when, in a July Washington Post
   interview, she wouldn't rule out retroceding the District to Maryland.
   Activist Anise Jenkins, a member of statehood group Free DC, calls DC
   Vote's voting-rights approach "the Kibbles and Bits of democracy."

   At a Council hearing on Orange's shadow delegation bill the same month,
   Charles Moreland, the first shadow representative, demanded that the
   Council strike language in the bill that would require the shadow
   delegation to list voting rights as an issue on their websites.

   "For statehood supporters to be yoked with voting rights proponents
   would be like teaming a thoroughbred horse with a long-headed
   Mississippi mule," Moreland says.
     __________________________________________________________________

   In the basement of the John A. Wilson Building, there's a door that's
   locked most of the time, even during business hours. Only one of the
   building's elevators goes there. Show up at the right time, though, and
   you'll find yourself in the shadow delegation's shared office suite.

   Shadow Sen. Michael D. Brown decorates his portion of the office with
   mementos from his time working as a political consultant for the
   national Democratic Party: a picture of a much-younger Brown shaking
   hands with Jimmy Carter on the president's doomed 1980 campaign; a
   signed Doonesbury cartoon.

   The rest of Brown's office is devoted to the detritus of the statehood
   campaigns he's dreamed up. There's mock-ups of statehood billboards at
   the 2012 Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C., funded by his share
   of voluntary donations from D.C. residents. (A piece of paper pasted
   under the pictures of the signs boasts that they "received a lot of
   press coverage.") Brown pulls out a guide he produced for teachers who
   want to teach statehood in their social studies curricula. One high
   school class in Missouri, Brown claims, ended up haranguing their state
   legislators over D.C. statehood after taking the course Brown designed.

   Brown is keeping busy, despite his slim budget. His office sponsors the
   DC Breeze, one of the District's two professional ultimate Frisbee
   teams. The sponsorship cost $500, an expense which won Brown the right
   to hang a statehood banner at their games and to throw out the first
   disc of the season. And he's on to new ideas, including
   statehood-branded beer and hot dogs, which he's planning to call
   "Freedom Franks." He's working on special recipes for the most ardent
   opponents of statehood. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Republican who
   regularly introduces bills to cede the District back to Maryland, will
   certainly earn his own dog, according to Brown. A volunteer designer is
   working on a costume for "Freedom Frank," the wieners' mascot.

   "It's a fine line I walk, trying to engage people without being a
   buffoon about it," Brown says.

   Brown estimates that he's spent $40,000 of his own money on statehood.
   But until recently, the shadow delegation has also drawn on the
   statehood tax check-off, a box on D.C. income forms that allows filers
   to donate money to the cause. Last year, the tax contribution earned
   $12,000, which was split among the three members of the delegation.
   Brown expects that the donation option will be cut from the tax forms
   entirely next year due to lack of interest.

   The plan was always problematic, with the Office of Tax and Revenue
   forgetting in 2006 to print the box on tax forms at all. Instead,
   would-be residents of New Columbia had to write "STATEHOOD" at the
   bottom of their filing. Brown blames the decline on e-filing methods
   like TurboTax not featuring the contribution options. In fact, the tax
   form contribution is available on all forms of electronic filing,
   according to a spokeswoman for the Office of the Chief Financial
   Officer.

   That may not entirely be a bad thing--in 2008, the tax money was spent
   on things like hosting a statehood luncheon with Hayden Panettiere.
   Yes, that Hayden Panettiere--the star of NBC's Heroes-turned-whale
   conservation activist-turned-D.C. statehood supporter. Panettiere
   became interested in statehood when she met Strauss at a 2008 campaign
   event for Barack Obama and asked him to use his position in the Senate
   to protect whales. Strauss explained that he couldn't, because he
   wasn't really a senator. "If you're out there fighting for the rights
   of vote-less mammals, well, I've got 600,000 of 'em right here in the
   city," Strauss told Roll Call.

   Brown's tenure hasn't been without some accomplishments. The shadow
   senators have wrested some perks from the Senate, including Senate
   license plates and ID badges that allow them to access the Senate
   dining room. (Bennett-Fleming claims that he's been too busy fighting
   for statehood to investigate whether he gets any representative-like
   privileges on the House side. Probably not; a spokesman for House
   Speaker John Boehner, when asked whether Bennett-Fleming enjoyed any
   perks, says there's no such thing as District shadow representative.)

   Brown worries, though, that a Republican-controlled Senate could take
   away all the privileges, however minor. Without statehood, Brown says,
   he's stuck relying on the kindness of strangers.

   "I often call myself the Blanche DuBois of American politics," he says.

   Even Brown's privileges as a quasi-senator don't afford him much access
   to actual senators. Instead, he says he's typically only able to make
   20-minute appointments with staffers. His best lobbying moments have
   come out of happenstance--buttonholing Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin at a
   University of Maryland basketball game, or ending up on a love seat
   with then-Sen. Hillary Clinton when she was courting Democratic
   super-delegates like Brown and Strauss in 2008.

   The stunt-based approach to statehood that Brown favors doesn't always
   go so well. In 2008, Brown, along with then-Mayor Adrian Fenty and
   eight members of the D.C. Council, flew to New Hampshire to convince
   their state legislature to back a resolution scolding the Granite
   State's senators for not supporting District voting rights. The bill
   died in the legislature, but that didn't stop District politicians from
   going back to New Hampshire to support another bill last year. That
   failed, too.

   Five years after the first trip to New Hampshire, Brown's still stewing
   over the Post's coverage, which included a description of At-Large
   Councilmember David Catania reading horoscopes. "They made us sound
   like the glee club from George Washington University that went to a
   party to sing," Brown says.

   Strauss, an attorney whom Brown describes as the lobbyist in their
   trio, has had a flashier tenure. On the glitzier side of
   pseudo-senatehood, he's palled around with Panettiere, escorted a D.C.
   beauty queen through the halls of Congress, and staged a mock tea party
   at the 2004 Democratic convention in Boston by pouring tea into the
   harbor. Strauss is a frequent sight at District parades, walking next
   to a blown-up cover of the 1930's pulp drama The Shadow.

   His 16 years in office haven't always gone so smoothly. Strauss was
   arrested in 2005 for arguing with police at a Georgetown dock and in
   2008 for driving under the influence. (He received probation.) He
   prominently displayed his Senate ID badge during his DUI arrest,
   according to police documents--a bold move for an actual senator, even
   more so for someone whose Senate office is actually in the Wilson
   Building.

   Then there are the interns. Because the shadow delegation can't afford
   professional staffers, interns play an outsized role in their office.
   (When I meet him, Bennett-Fleming is accompanied by a two interns who
   double as his statehood encyclopedias.) Strauss has a reputation among
   statehood activists for employing foreign interns who don't realize
   when they apply that he's not a real senator. Strauss' opponent in next
   year's election, furniture magnate Pete Ross, pointedly mentions that
   he won't have interns from Paris.

   Strauss' interns are as numerous as they are foreign. Strauss arrived
   at the 2008 Democratic convention in Denver with seven interns in tow,
   compared to one person in Brown's entourage. Stranger, Strauss had them
   outfitted with Secret Service-style earpieces, according to convention
   coverage in DCist and the Post. All the coordination didn't pay off for
   the District--that year's Democratic platform, like the platforms in
   2004 and 2012, didn't mention D.C. statehood.

   Strauss didn't respond to requests for comment placed through one of
   those interns.

   License plates and ID badges and tony lunches aside, both Strauss and
   Brown have tried to ditch the job. Seven years ago, Strauss ran
   unsuccessfully for the Ward 3 D.C. Council spot. The Washington Times,
   at least, wasn't impressed with the shadow delegation's name
   recognition. "As the city's shadow senator for the press 10 years
   [sic], Paul Strauss is coming out of what amounts to the Witness
   Protection Program," one reporter wrote.

   Brown's political career may ultimately be more damaging for the
   delegation's future. In 2010, he ran against then-At-Large
   Councilmember Phil Mendelson in what he says was an attempt to raise
   more publicity for statehood. Brown says he was hoping to come in
   second, bringing up his pet issue in every debate.

   More cynical observers figured that the white Brown--quickly nicknamed
   White Mike--was trying to capitalize on his name similarity with the
   better-known, African-American then-At-Large Councilmember Michael A.
   Brown. Brown's version of the story goes like a penny-ante Macbeth,
   with his modest ambitions to run as a publicity stunt replaced by a
   hunger to win when he saw a Post poll two weeks before the Democratic
   primary that showed him ahead of Mendelson. It's hard to believe this
   was because of residents' love of the shadow delegation or heavy
   campaigning on Brown's part: A month before the primary, Brown had
   raised no money. Once the poll came out, he started publishing
   confusing flyers without his face or mention of his shadow senator
   work. In return, people scrawled "White Man" on his signs in Ward 8.

   "In the end, I did a lot of harm to myself," says Brown. That includes
   potentially earning the enmity of Mendelson, who, as Council chairman
   now, has a lot of say about the future of the delegation funding bill.

   At least Brown's trying to make nice--city gift disclosures show that
   he treated Mendelson to lunch at McCormick & Schmick's in July. Before
   the shadow delegation can lobby Congress, apparently, it has to lobby
   its own government.
     __________________________________________________________________

   At just 28 years old, Shadow Rep. Nate Bennett-Fleming doesn't bring
   the same political baggage as his Senate counterparts. But that doesn't
   stop him from possessing the defining characteristic of statehood
   activists, namely, distaste for other statehood activists. He rattles
   off the problems with the statehood movement before he joined:
   "disjointed," "ad hoc," not "strategically sound."

   "Our movement is laughable almost," says Bennett-Fleming. Why
   Bennett-Fleming, a Berkeley Law School graduate and an adjunct
   professor at the University of the District of Columbia, would sign on
   with such a joke of a movement is one of the curiosities of the
   statehood delegation. For his part, Bennett-Fleming says that he
   doesn't have ambitions for any higher office of the sort that people
   outside the District actually recognize.

   While Brown thinks of promotional schemes and Strauss hosts parties,
   Bennett-Fleming and a crew of D.C. university students who work as his
   interns focus on meetings with congressional staffers. They point to a
   statehood bill introduced by then-Sen. Joe Lieberman late last year,
   just before he retired. (It didn't pass.) In June, at a ceremony adding
   a statue of Frederick Douglass as the District's addition to the
   Capitol's Statuary Hall, Senate Majority Leader Reid reiterated his
   support for statehood. That support, though, seems mostly symbolic: So
   far, it hasn't convinced Reid to make D.C. statehood a legislative
   priority or advance a bill for it through the Senate.

   Bennett-Fleming and his entourage focused their lobbying on minority
   caucuses like the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional
   Asian Pacific American Caucus, rounding up 50 co-sponsors for the
   House's statehood legislation. Bennett-Fleming says this is a sign the
   statehood movement is back from past defeats, but that's only a little
   more than a tenth of the body's members. For all their work, statehood
   supporters are basically just winning over Democrats in a chamber
   controlled by Republicans.

   And Republicans really, really don't want to make D.C. a state. Putting
   aside constitutional issues, it's hard to imagine the GOP welcoming two
   senators from a city where winning the Democratic primary practically
   guarantees electoral victory.

   "We're too black, we're too urban," says Brown, paraphrasing Ted
   Kennedy's explanation of why D.C. will never receive a real
   congressional delegation. "We're too Democratic, and we're too
   liberal."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Those doubts hint at a truth that goes unmentioned at rallies and
   Council hearings, a truth that $1 million or $10 million from the
   District's budget won't solve. Statehood isn't foundering because the
   rest of the country doesn't care (although that's true). It's been
   stalled for decades because Republicans don't want to empower a
   guaranteed vote for Democrats.

   The failure to get at that fundamental problem--and the hopeless
   situation it creates for the District--leaves activists jumping between
   whole-hog endeavors like statehood and more incremental demands like
   budget autonomy or voting rights. The logic behind pushing for
   statehood above all else makes perverse sense: If we're not going to
   get anything, we might as well try for as big a portion of nothing as
   possible.

   But the shadow delegation's description of how it would use the
   proposed budget, which includes $75,000 for each of them to hire
   staffers and $75,000 each for promoting statehood, doesn't inspire much
   confidence. Mendelson asked Strauss at the hearing on the bill why he
   hadn't brought his own speculative budget, but Strauss demurred. Since
   the shadow senators and representative are elected just like
   councilmembers, according to Strauss' logic, the delegation shouldn't
   have to justify how it will spend money from the Council. "When money
   is given to other elected officials, there's some deference to those
   agencies," Strauss said.

   Without the ability to change the make-up of Congress, the shadow
   delegation's remaining goal--keeping the demands for statehood at a low
   hum--doesn't require much money at all. Joshua Burch, a Brookland
   resident who's mentioned by Capozzi as one of statehood's best hopes,
   leads lobbying trips of District residents to the Hill. Burch's success
   without District money demonstrates the one advantage the District's
   statehood push does have: the people who want it live next to Congress.

   Orange, who introduced the bill, didn't respond to a request for
   comment about the bill through his staff. The bill, which includes
   another $550,000 for the Council to spend on statehood-related lobbying
   and advertising, stands a good chance of passing the legislature. It's
   already been co-sponsored or co-introduced by five other members.

   Bennett-Fleming bristles when it's pointed out that, co-sponsors aside,
   the statehood bills will likely never become reality as long as
   Republicans control half of Congress. And that's generous--even when
   Democrats controlled the presidency and both the House and the Senate,
   the District wasn't even able to get a favorable voting rights bill
   passed.

   "It doesn't take a genius to see the bill isn't going to get passed,"
   says Bennett-Fleming. Instead, the repeated requests for co-sponsors
   every congressional session is meant to get members used to supporting
   statehood. No matter how well members of Congress are drilled to
   support statehood, though, that doesn't translate into progress until
   votes are actually taken on the legislation.

   One possibility popular with activists for getting around Republican
   opposition is teaming up with Puerto Rico as a two-state package. The
   party's 2012 convention platform supported statehood for the island,
   this thinking goes, so why not throw D.C. in, too? Under this theory,
   Republicans would allow the deal in an attempt to win back Hispanic
   voters scared off by the party's vacillation on immigration reform.
   "You would think that the national Republican Party would do everything
   it could to stop the fastest-growing minority in the United States from
   becoming a sure thing for the Democratic Party," local TV analyst and
   statehood gadfly Mark Plotkin wrote in a 2012 op-ed in the Post.

   There are several problems with teaming up with Puerto Rico, including
   whether the Republican leadership could corral its members to support
   the statehood package and whether two Democratic senators from the
   District for two Puerto Rican senators with party affiliations to be
   named later would really amount to an even trade. Supporters of the
   two-for-one statehood deal also ignore something else: Puerto Rico
   doesn't want us.

   Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi--essentially the
   territory's equivalent of Norton--thinks the District should find
   another partner. "We're talking about different quests," he says.

   While statehood may be decades away, the Council will consider the
   funding bill this fall. For Brown, at least, time is running out. With
   two children in college and another soon to follow, he says he needs to
   starting getting paid for his lobbying from Orange's bill, or he'll
   have to quit. Whether that would be a bad thing, of course, depends on
   your opinion about the efficacy of novelty hot dogs and brief meetings
   with Senate staffers.

   Facing the end of his statehood career, Brown expresses a sentiment
   more common among failing artists than congressional lobbyists with
   Senate IDs: It sucks to have a job you love and not get paid for it.

   For Bennett-Fleming, the potential funding boost offers another
   opportunity: rehabbing the shadow delegation's reputation in the
   District. "Clearly, the shadow delegation isn't held in the highest
   esteem of the voters," he says. Will we love them more once they get
   six figures of taxpayer money to spend?

   The last thing we need is to start using taxpayer money to pay shadow
   reps! Let them fund raise if they want to be paid. Further, DC will not
   become a state because nobody but people who live in DC care (and I
   would imagine that not even all of them care).

   As a Democrat and a DC resident, I oppose statehood - at least for now.
   The Constitution set up DC as a non-state. Also, we are a city of
   600,000. Why should we get 2 voting senators? It would give us
   disproportional power. It would be wrong and unfair.
   Now, the good news is that Statehood won't come in years, if ever. The
   Statehood movement is part of the reason.
   Look at the clowns who spoke on behalf of statehood.
   Marion Barry is not exactly the guy you want as your poster-child, but
   the clowns in the statehood movement didn't have the guts to keep him
   of the podium.
   Michael D. Brown is a white guy who ran for Council while pretending to
   be the black Councilmember Michael A Brown. Why would the Statehood
   people let that fraud on the podium?
   Mayor Vince Gray spoke but Gray might get indicted. That's why he has
   not announced if he's running for re-election yet. Why would let
   someone about to be indicted speak on behalf of our cause?
   Delegate Norton spoke. This is the same Delegate whose claim to fame is
   that she and her husband somehow forgot to pay federal taxes for three
   years. The woman has no credibility, but the boneheads in Vote DC let
   her on the podium.
   With geniuses like these in charge, Statehood doesn't have a chance.

   @ DC Democrat: We should get statehood because we have a larger
   population than Wyoming per the 2010 census. We should get statehood
   because we paid more (numbers are from 2007 which is the most recent
   year available in a quick Google search) in Federal Income Tax than
   Wyoming, Montana, and both Dakotas *combined.*
   Now, I think we should approach statehood through the Supreme Court
   rather than through attempting to bargain with Congress, but that's
   just me.

   The bottom line is that the 632,000 citizens of the District of
   Columbia lack equal status with the rest of the United States of
   America. We do not have the power to change our status, and
   powerlessness often leads to fractured and divisive action, like we
   have been seeing. The statehood bill would shrink the size of the
   federal district to the National Capitol Service Area, already defined
   by Congress, and allow the residential and commercial parts of DC to
   join the Union on an equal status. Historically, there have been as
   many at 850,000 people living in DC, on par with some nine states. This
   is about fairness and civil rights. I'm for statehood because it fixes
   our lack of status for good--no more being a "laboratory" for anyone's
   ideas, except our own.

   Statehood, and possibly even full voting rights in the House, won't
   stand a chance until some years after Mayor-for-Life Barry has departed
   and become the Mayor-for-Eternal-Life.
   That said, I've long thought that ads run in key states with
   DC-resident military veterans might get some traction -- along the
   lines of "I fought to bring voting rights to Iraq (or Afghanistan), but
   back home in Washington, I don't even get a vote for Congress." And try
   to fine diverse military veterans (white, Asian, Latino, not just
   African-American), to confound the stereotypes that the rest of America
   has about DC politics.

   Adding to Anne's point, we have fought two wars in the Middle East in
   the past 10 years to give others what residents of the District don't
   have: self-determination. One could credibly package the sorry
   political state of the DC resident (of which I'm one), and label it
   Iraq, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, etc. - and many Americans, if not the
   majority, would shout "this cannot stand!" But ask these same Americans
   about DC Statehood, and they don't care, and don't want "to give
   Washington any more power." (I kid you not, this is a verbatim quote
   from an otherwise very sane friend outside this area.)
   Another response I've heard when I complain about taxation w/o
   representation is that I should simply move - VA and MD are mere
   minutes away, and there I would receive full citizenship. Really? So
   apparently it is OK to be an American citizen, living in America, and
   not have the rights and privileges that all other Americans do - we can
   just move, as though it were as easy as changing where you buy your
   groceries if you stop liking Safeway's policies.
   If DC is to be treated like Puerto Rico, let's get the same deal they
   have - income produced within the District is not subject to federal
   income tax. (PR residents do not pay personal tax on PR-generated
   income.) I'd be a lot happier with my lack of representation if I got a
   break from the taxation ...

   I find this article to be a bit cynical and oversimplistic in its
   analysis of the statehood issue and the "fund the delegation" bill. For
   example, LL says that the truth that goes unmentioned is that
   Republicans do not support our efforts. That can be the furthest from
   the truth, Republican opposition to our efforts are cited and
   acknowledge frequently by DC citizens and leaders.
   Then LL makes it seem like the work that it took to get 50 cosponsors
   on the bill is insignificant because 50 is apparently a small number
   and only Democrats are on the bill. Plenty of bills pass with no
   cosponsors, and plenty of bills with many cosponsors stand no chance of
   passing. The idea is to use the co-sponsorship process to build support
   in Congress. Why would we focus on Republicans, when we don't even have
   full support in the Democratic caucus?
   The long term strategy that I have employed is to focus on building
   Democratic support, so that when Democrats have control, we will have a
   strong chance for success. (explained to LL, but not mentioned in the
   article) So in fact, the strategy that I have employed takes into
   account the "unmentioned" Republican problem that LL cites. But then
   later in the article, LL lauds the efforts of my friend Josh Burch as a
   success, when Josh is doing the exact same thing that we are doing in
   my office (we work together, and I suppot his efforts). But of course
   LL mentions Burch's "success" as a reason not to invest into these
   efforts. I'm sure Josh would tell you he could do 100 times more with
   some basic resources.
   Frankly, this is a long term fight (one that we have been fighting for
   over 200 years), and the reason why I decided to run for Shadow
   Representative is because I think that DC's status is something that
   should change, and I think that I can contribute to making that change.
   What is so curious about that?
   The problem is that DC has suffered from a poor quality of elected
   leadership for so long, that when a leader with some potential comes
   around, we can't even appreciate it. On one hand, we castigate elected
   officials for their high salaries, their perks, etc...then when someone
   runs for an office that doesn't come with the perks, but comes with the
   headaches of trying to bring some comptency to a movement that has been
   neglected, you get castigated because the office doesn't come with
   perks/salaries, etc. I thought you were supposed to run for office
   because you cared about public service, not because you care about
   perks etc.
   The current state of our fight is as such because of a lack of
   attention, resources, and because of political forces that are largely
   outside of our control. Due to these factors, the environment may not
   be ripe for DC statehood/equality today or tomorrow. But, this is not a
   logical reason to not invest in the fight. We must begin to invest now,
   if want to reap the benefits later. If we do not, we will continue to
   have the state of affairs that we have today, brought about by years of
   inattention, misplaced strategy, and lack of investment by the DC
   government.

   "It's been stalled for decades because Republicans don't want to
   empower a guaranteed vote for Democrats."
   This is patently false. It's been stalled because neither party has
   supported DC statehood. Look at the vote in the 90's, a majority of
   BOTH parties voted against it. The Dems controlled both houses and the
   White House in 2009 and nothing happened.
   This is why NBF's plan is the best one possible. He's building support
   with Dems, so that if they find themselves in the same situation they
   were in in 2009, they won't squander it. And the selling point to the
   Dems is the same thing R's hate about it - it will give the Democrats
   two more Senators.
   Yes, DC deserves full voting rights for all the reasons of democracy
   and freedom and service, etc.. that others mention. But what will get
   it for us, (and Chuck is wrong about an Amendment being needed) is raw
   politics.
   If R's had the chance to add a 100% reliable Republican state, with two
   Senators and a House seat, would they pass it up? Absolutely not. So we
   need to convince Dem's that this is in their own best interest, which
   should not be too hard, since it is. Then we need to hope they can get
   full control again - which is hard, but will eventually happen.

   Have spent 6 years in the "shadows" there is so much to comment on
   here, but I'll keep it short.
   First, getting co-sponsors for the statehood bill is a great thing to
   be doing now (and just about the only game on the Hill right now) as it
   gets people on record and lets us shore up support from those who
   should be supporting this cause now so when things may actually move
   someday we have some momentum and a history of making that ask. I've
   been on several of those Capitol Hill days and the work of Joshua
   Burch, Nate Bennett-Fleming, other activists has been very
   productive....more productive than people who actually get paid to do
   this in my opinion.
   Second, it's fair game to rip on Strauss for his intern sourcing and
   propensity for having an entourage...but I will that those interns do
   work hard for DC and over the years have played a key supportive role
   to a lot of statehood efforts. So be kind to them if you see one in the
   Wilson Building.
   Lastly, if we get locked into arguments over the facts regrading
   statehood, we'll never get anywhere. Facts are cheap these days, it's
   the people with the best stories that win....and we have the better
   story than the opponents. Let's not loose sight of that.

   Unfortunately, the reporter either had an anti-DC Statehood agenda of

   nothing positive could be said in this article. Several of the people
   (including me) spoke with this reporter for some time and only the most
   negative interpretations of those conversations were published. It is a
   shame that a rag called the "Washington City Paper" is so obviously
   opposed to the most basic of equal political rights for DC residents.
   Of course, common sense will tell you that elected officials charged
   with such a serious task as Statehood must be paid. Federal tax-free
   Puerto Rico has spent 20 million dollars in the last year to lobby for
   statehood, even before its residents have fully embraced the idea. The
   reporter spent so much time demeaning the DC Statehood movement (with
   the paper's approval), he failed to report that DC residents voted to
   end their political apartheid years ago. Nothing the City Paper can do
   will change the fact that such a Movement needs to be funded and the
   people's vote needs to be honored. My question is why is the City Paper
   so viciously opposed to democracy? What stake does it have in
   maintaining the status quo?

   with two Senators.
   The idea is absurd. Grossly unfair to the rest of the country.
   And only adds to a general perception that DC considers itself above
   all the others.

   David Grant....the difference between DC and every other similarly
   sized city is that DC has its own independent political identity,
   developed over 200 years. Retrocession means that our political
   identity is severed, something that many do not want to do. Finally,
   your Senate argument doesn't hold, because population has nothing to do
   with your Senate allocation. The entire purpose of the Senate is to
   have a legislative body where representation is not determined by the
   size of your population. As you know, DC has more population than 2
   states, and has similar population than about 8 other states. So the
   fact that we are currently classified as a "city" semantically, is not
   a strong basis to be against statehood. In fact, that argument is
   fundamentally flawed.

   D.C. Statehood: It's all political, stupid! NOT!
   As a relative neophyte to the District, I find it incredulous, that
   after decades of "talking" about statehood, we are, as of this moment,
   still "talking" about it. Why is that the case? There are many and
   varied resaons, some of which have been enumerated in this article, but
   my take on the issue is very simplistic.
   If the citizens of the District are truly enamored with the idea of
   statehood, then They must Demand such, and as an iconic District
   resident of the past, Frederick Douglas, stated, they must agitate,
   agitate, agatate! I have personally attended a few rallies for
   statehood over the past years, and have been truly flabergasted by the
   turnout, or more to the point, lack thereof.
   A perfect example of which is last spring, when Mayor Gray and
   approximately 40 others were arrested for exercising their rights as
   citizens to participate in an act of civil disobedience. Less than half
   of the councilmembers were in attendance at this event. However, of
   more of a concern is the fact that less than 200 individuals actually
   showed up for the rally itself. Contribute it complacency, apathy or
   whatever, but it speaks volumes about the seriousness to which the
   citizens of the District presently view this issue.
   Here's a few suggestions for the proponents of statehood:
   1. Have statehood as a lithmus test for everyone seeking city-wide
   office.
   2. Get every councilmember on record as either for or against,
   immediately.
   3. Quit "begging" for sponsors; start with a presentation before the
   United Nations and continue disseminating the fact that in a democratic
   country, a significant portion of its population is disenfranchised.
   4. Take direct action -- It is a known fact that a vast majority of the
   daily workers in the Distrct originate from outside of the its borders.
   That said, instead of "talking" about staging a peaceful protest to
   prevent these workers from entering the city, just do it! This is
   extremely important, becuase like the Montgomery Boycott, this will not
   entail a one-day event. It has to be done daily, Monday - Friday, for
   however long it takes. It also means quite a few individuals will be
   arrested, which is a small price to pay for democracy.
   5. If all else fails, quit paying taxes to the federal government,
   which would surely get the attention of more than a few persons in very
   high places.
   For the purest who often, stridently cling to the Constitution as their
   basis for denying statehood, I remind them that the Constitution, like
   the Magna Carta and unlike the Bible is a living document, which means,
   it is subject to change (see Amendment).
   Absent any of the aforementioned, those favoring statehood will be
   still "talking" about it, if and or until the District's demographics
   change drastically. Hold up!, wait a minute! That is happening as I
   write. As the sultry balladeer Sam Cooke once crooned, "A Change Is
   Gonna Come." How soon?, my prognostication is it will be determine by
   the demographics, as opposed to the politics.

   Lithmus tests in politics are silly.
   I'd like to find out how councilmembers would plan to fund a state (and
   if they have a better name than the lame "New Columbia").
   2. Get every councilmember on record as either for or against,
   immediately.
   Again, how do they propose to pay for statehood when we would lose
   federal funding, such as how they pay for DC's entire criminal justice
   system.
   3. Quit "begging" for sponsors; start with a presentation before the
   United Nations and continue disseminating the fact that in a democratic
   country, a significant portion of its population is disenfranchised.
   Ah, the United Nations. That's an effective body. Perhaps Putin will be
   supportive, and maybe we can get Assad to endorse DC statehood!
   4. Take direct action -- It is a known fact that a vast majority of the
   daily workers in the Distrct originate from outside of the its borders.
   That said, instead of "talking" about staging a peaceful protest to

   Brilliant! This is guaranteed to garner lots of public support from
   voters in MD and VA who already face difficult commutes into DC. And
   it's sure to help with statehood support from the MD and VA
   congressional delegations. And in the long
   term, it will just encourage more businesses to set up shop in the MD
   and VA suburbs. DC already has too much of a reputation as a tough
   place to do business.
   5. If all else fails, quit paying taxes to the federal government,
   which would surely get the attention of more than a few persons in very
   high places.
   E.H. Norton can offer helpful advice here, since she didn't pay DC
   taxes for years. Yet somehow she didn't lose her home in a tax
   foreclosure sale, the way our ever competent, responsive DC government
   allowed people to lose their entire home equity over $400 tax bills.

   statehood, it would generate revenue just like any other state. As far
   as making the commute more difficult for our citizens coming from
   outside of the District "A Change Is Gonna Come," eventually, sooner or
   later. Can you say PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION?
   You deem lithmus rests as "silly" which I, along with an inordinnate
   amount of others (see Tea Party denizens, et al) disagree. As for as
   Norton and Barry are concerned, should we at some point give up on
   beating a dead horse(s) to death! I am not sure if you are cognizant of
   this fact, but the District's demographics are changing as I write. It
   is just a matter of time before these new citizens realize that it
   imperative to elect the "best qualifed" irrespective of party
   affiliation, race or gender. At least that is my Hope for Change!
