   RICHMOND

   Catering costs and a wedding dress aren't the only expenses Gov. Bob
   McDonnell's family apparently avoided in connection with the June 2011
   nuptials of his daughter Cailin: They also received some free limousine
   service.

   A political donor from Virginia Beach invited to the ceremony provided
   the use of his 19-passenger Hummer stretch limo, which was used to take
   members of the wedding party from the church to the reception site at
   Virginia's executive mansion on the state capitol grounds.

   That freebie is the latest in a string of questioned gifts - from an
   expensive watch to vacation accommodations - that have come to light as
   part of an unfolding federal investigation surrounding McDonnell.

   Use of the limo was provided by Dr. Paul C. Davis, a Beach radiologist
   and political contributor.

   Two years ago, Davis drove the white luxury vehicle to the wedding
   after he said the bride-to-be, Cailin McDonnell, one of the governor's
   five children, called him ahead of time and asked about it.

   Davis, who has made a few campaign donations to McDonnell over the
   years, said the going rental rate for the limo is $100 per hour, noting
   he usually rents it in seven-hour blocks. It was used for about two
   hours after the wedding, primarily to transport bridesmaids and
   groomsmen, Davis recalled.

   When interviewed Friday, he wasn't sure whether the bride and groom
   rode in it but seemed confident the governor and his wife did not.

   "I spoke pretty much to Cailin," Davis said of the arrangements for use
   of the limo, adding, "I don't know what dynamics went on between the
   mother and daughter and father."

   The bride's request didn't seem unusual to Davis at the time - he said
   he has known the governor for years - and he explained that he's loaned
   the vehicle to other friends before.

   In light of the investigation, however, it's getting a second look, at
   least from McDonnell's people. An accountant for the governor called
   this spring asking about the loaner limo and whether any "money
   exchanged hands," Davis said.

   None did, he told the accountant.

   Davis said he has not been contacted by government investigators.

   McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin declined to comment about those
   events, and the governor has sidestepped the media's questions about
   active investigations.

   The avoided limo cost pales in comparison to the wedding dress Cailin
   reportedly received free of charge from a Norfolk bridal boutique and
   the $15,000 check from Richmond-area businessman Jonnie R. Williams
   Sr., whose gifts to the governor and his family appear to be linked to
   a federal probe. Williams is the head of troubled health supplement
   company Star Scientific Inc., which has contributed more than $108,000
   to McDonnell and his political action committee.

   The U.S. Attorney's Office did not respond to a request for comment
   Friday.

   In addition to a federal inquiry, McDonnell's economic disclosure
   reports also face review by Richmond's Commonwealth's Attorney Michael
   Herring.

   No money changed hands, but the "loan" of the vehicle has real monetary
   value, when properly rented.

   And is traditionally paid for by the father of the bride.

[228]it seems a little bold of rolex bob

   Submitted by [229]Monica Copacabana on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 11:10 am.

   It seems a little hypocritical for Rolex Bob to be taking all kinds of
   gifts from political donors while demanding more accountability from
   teachers (most of whom are our middle income hard-working
   freedom-lovin' American mothers, daughters, family and friends who
   would sacrifice their own lives to save the lives of their students).
   It's time for our wealthy and well-connected politicians to get off the
   backs of teachers and start demanding more accountability from their
   well-connected political lawmaker colleagues.

[235]My daughter's is costing me

   Submitted by [236]lee1956 on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 12:04 pm.

   My daughter's is costing me a fortune. I'd greatly appreciate anyone
   who wants to contribute to the $45K budget for next spring. All
   McDonnell had to do was to disclose these gifts, and all would have
   been good. There's no prohibition against the gifts per se. At the very
   least, failure to disclose shows a lack of focus and common sense. Most
   would say it shows a brazen disregard for the financial disclosure
   requirements. I would not go so far as to say that it shows unethical
   conduct, though some do.

   Stop trying to make something out of nothing. If a family friend or
   donor wishes to give the service as a wedding gift, it is perfectly OK.
   You should all have bigger fish to complain about with the rape of the
   American citizens by the current administration in Washington. $5000
   per night hotel rooms for the Mrs. and the girls, personal use of Air
   Force One, giving $7 billion to other countries when we are deeply in
   debt in our own country.

   You miss the point. Such services are provided for the President (and
   all other Presidents in modern times). That is an accepted practice and
   comes with the job, for many valid reasons. The President and family do
   not ASK for these services from wealthy political donors.

   Submitted by [320]AndThatsTheWayI... on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 7:19 am.

   "The President and family do not ASK for these services from wealthy
   political donors." Of course they don't. That's why WE pay their
   assistants to do the asking.That way the president and his family have
   clean hands so to speak.

   Please show some proof for your accusation that aids of the President

   For security and other good reasons, the government is responsible for
   the travel of each President and their family.

[333]CONFUSED?

   Submitted by [334]URDEggMen on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 9:33 am.

   It seems as though our poster who is railing about the President has no
   clue what Federal law is surrounding the PResident and his family. If
   he did, he would know that Federal laws are in place specifically to
   prevent this sort of thing from happening. In Virginia, however, it is
   perfectly legal for elected leaders to accept any and all manner of
   bribe, uh, er, gift - as long as it's reported. McDonnell seems to be
   playing fast and loose with the "family" loophole in Virginia law. To
   equate this with the President, whether it's Obama or Bush or whomever,
   is just another ignorant partisant rant that only points out who little
   the poster knows about the law and the real world. Back away from the
   Fox News box. It's makes you look stupid.

   Wonder if the millionaire Hollywood actors/actresses put on their IRS
   form 1040 the "loan" of movie props and the bling and clothes they get
   "loaned" to them. Every red carpet show asks "Who are you wearing?".

   Wonder if the children of politicians have to report their Halloween
   candy? Wonder if the children of politicians have to report Christmas
   gifts from Santa? Wonder if the engagement ring has to be reported?

   I am more worried about legislation and regulations and enforcement
   being pushed as the direct result of campaign contributions. Look at
   the ambassadors appointed who got the job by donating a bunch to A
   president.

   How far do we go to stop?

[410]Mrs. McDonnell's $10,000 suede jacket

   Submitted by [411]Bob Lakeman on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 5:53 am.

   I would sure like to see the $10,000 suede jacket that Mrs. McDonnell
   asked Jonny Williams to buy her right after Bob was elected Governor. I
   guess she didn't care for the jackets at TJ Maxx!

   I am just amazed that the Governor, his wife and daughter Cailin feel
   somehow entitled to demand very lavish and expensive gifts from people
   seeking political favors. Their greed is quite incredible and
   transparent. At least George Allen and his wife Susan understood how to
   manage state affairs without looking to personally enrich themselves
   and weren't personally up for sale to people looking for political
   favors.

[431]the next headline reads

   Submitted by [432]portworker on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 7:21 am.

   "Governor McDonnell didn't pay full price at yard sale". The artilce
   will read that Governor McDonnell and his wife went to a yard sale and
   to the dismay of the family asked a lower price than originally said.
   Mrs. Thomas said she firmly told the governor the price for box of
   Reader's Digests was five dollars, but the governor suggested she take
   $3. Mrs. Thomas felt pressured because he was the governor and
   reluctantly took the $3 for the magazines that had been in the Thomas
   family for yaers.
   A review of the financial disclosure reports did not show the
   transaction.

   Wrong is wrong and should be punished accordingly, but this series of
   articles is getting to the appearance of "out to get you".

   ... the non-reporting of the Clinton fundraising machine, which makes
   Gov. McDonnell (as bad as he is) come across as a piker by comparison.

   None of those Clinton-based stories (e.g., Marc Rich, Chinese bundlers,
   Hasidic sects) were ever reported in real time, and the retrospective
   reporting did not get even a fraction of the coverage that is being
   devoted to this gross stupidity on the part of our Republican governor.

   Gov. McDonnell's political future is kaput -- as it should be. Hillary
   Clinton's political future is unaffected by far more egregious
   behavior. The media most definitely IS biased.

   Once the wolf acquires the taste it stays focused on the task. Appears
   that the Gov. is under the microscope and the wolf is at the door.
   Every day the Gov. seems to have stepped into it even more. This is
   really great for Virginia and the Republican party.
   Perhaps he is following in BHO's footsteps? Next week a family outing
   to Africa? Perhaps he could save us some money and just go to Atlantis

[732]Probably was a gift

   Submitted by [733]vb_techie on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 4:37 pm.

   Quite frankly, if this were the only issue, I doubt anyone would even
   be discussing it. However, it seems like "the hits keep on coming". I'm
   not even certain if McDonnell broke any laws - it will depend in large
   part on exactly how the rules regarding gifts are written/intepreted,
   and IANAL (or judge, for that matter).

   IMO, the issue is less about legality and more about ethics, or lack
   thereof. McDonnell should have disclosed all of these gifts. Failure to
   do so gives, at a minimum, the appearance of impropriety. With that
   said, the quantity and value of the gift in their totality certainly
   raises a number of questions.

   Note to Pilot: Bobby D has quite a few folks looking to make friends in
   high places, but since the Pilot has an undeniable leftist slant, I do
   not trust you.

   What I would like to see is comparison of the gifts of the last 4
   governors. I know that some of the concern is related to unreported
   gifts, but the Pilot has been able to find out about McDonnell's; thus,
   I'm sure they can find out about the other governors, too.

   How about it? Let's have a side by side comparison to see if Bobby D is
   really more egregious than others.

   keeping up with what pops up every other day about the McDonnell's
   gifts and so on.

   I don't recall any other of VA's governors, Dems or GOP, who used the
   Governor's Mansion to push a product from a company and it's CEO who
   gave so much to the family of those Governors.

   Do you recall any of that? I doubt it would have slipped by any GOP
   folks who knew of such goings on from our other governors.

   With the current investigation/trial going on regarding the McDonnell's
   former chef, it's not like the Pilot is going out of its way to uncover
   this stuff.

   Bush blamed 9/11 on Iraq with "evidence" even he laughs at now, and we

   dead at Benghazi to over 3500 dead in New York. Wow.

   when all else fails portray yourself as a victim. I look at this way:
   If I have to hire a limousine then the rich and famous should have to
   hire one, too. If I want to wear a Rolex watch, then I should purchase
   one. Some will stand by the Titanic as it sinks into the ocean like
   some who will accept gifts when they shouldn't and know better.

[858]Of course the McDonnell's actions are important!

   Submitted by [859]GolfbytheCupful on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 8:47 pm.

   We constantly hear about the importance of state's rights. We work hard
   to get voters to the polls when less exciting elections take place in
   cities and states. We know that bills and laws that effect us so much
   are related to and are the results of how these smaller, seemingly
   unimportant elections play out.

   I believe that we must pay attention to the laws and taxes, etc., that
   are enacted by our state and city legislators and officials. They're
   too important not to.

   For you to toss aside, as unimportant, the legislators we elect which
   are closer to us than DC, is wrong. The laws these people enact effect
   us daily. So, naturally we're looking at the laws our local, city and
   state leaders break.

   Why wouldn't we?

[879]Rolexes and Limos and purses are not "perks" of the job.

   Submitted by [880]JPOV on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 8:22 pm.

   A perk of the job is like if you work in a pizza shop and get to take
   home pizzas that people called in and didn't pick up.
   Or if you are a country which is a recipient of Foreign "Aid". There is
   no accountability there so you can buy all the "Rolexes and Limos and
   purses" that you want.
   7 Billion dollars sure buys a lot of "perks".

[886]Just two requests

   Submitted by [887]Bob Lakeman on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 8:25 pm.

   1. I would like to see the thank you note that Cailin McDonnell wrote
   to Jonnie Williams for the $15,000 he gave her.

   2. I would like to see Mo McDonnell wear the $10,000 suede jacket she
   told Jonnie Williams to buy her to her next public appearance so
   citizens can see if Jonnie was getting his money's worth.

[893]Slow news day?

   Submitted by [894]BILLFIVEASH on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 8:51 pm.

   I greatly respect The Pilot and all who operate it but how much ink has
   already been used on this continuing story. Next we will find out $500
   in flowers, a $200 cake, $75 in bouquets etc were donated and will that
   merit writing 3 more stories of investigative tabloid gotcha
   journalistic stories? Please reserve the ink and space in the paper for
   news that is more enlightening and thoughtful. It is starting to look
   like The Pilot may not like The Governor!?

[900]The issue isn't the gifts

   the issue is that he didn't report them. If he had it would be a non

   And ol' Bob thought he was so frickin' smart...that by quoting the
   bible and hanging out with Pat Robertson, he'd be able to cover over
   his sins.

   It seems he must have missed those ethics and morality classes at
   Episcopal, Notre Dame, and Regent. Hanging out with those cheerleaders,
   eh, Bob? Doesn't say much for a religious school education.

   So what? Someone can't give an elected official a gift? Did this hurt
   anyone or are people just jealous? He's a VIP and he deserves to be
   treated like one.

[935]These are serious questions?

   Submitted by [936]lee1956 on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 9:51 pm.

   These are serious questions? We've had financial disclosure laws for
   elected officials for at least 4 decades. Nothing prevents the gifts.
   You just need to disclose them. Everyone on a local board knows the
   rules. I've had to fill out the forms myself.

[942]He is a VIP because he is the Governor

   Submitted by [943]What me worry on Mon, 07/01/2013 at 10:14 pm.

   The Governor of Virginia is not a waiter to be tipped.
   To avoid the appearance of impropriety, to at least appear honest he
   should avoid avoid accepting the trips, the shmata, the fru fru, the
   limos and the bling. Oh wait! These gifts are from donors that have
   nothing but pure love for the McDonnells and they expects nothing in
   return, right? Yeah right.

[970]A matter of judgement

   Submitted by [971]geraldc32357 on Tue, 07/02/2013 at 12:01 pm.

   Many of us question Gov McDonnell as a matter of judgement. He should
   not be close to the wrong side of full disclosure--he should err on
   side of discretion. When he (and his family) push the limits, they seem
   self-seeking and above the law. All of us were taught in school to
   expect MORE than average from elected leaders, yet they keep giving us
   less. Gov McDonnell also put a $65 tax on hybrid cars, which I and
   others made sacrifices to buy, hoping to help the environment and
   economy; that was a stupid decision by Gov McDonnell, and it further
   supports the notion that he is lacking in judgement. As others have
   said, the good coming out of this may be that he has doomed himself as
   a candidate for any higher office. GOP leaders must beware.

[977]Limo

   Submitted by [978]possum42 on Tue, 07/02/2013 at 3:23 pm.

   It isn't the wrongdoing alone, it is the appearance of wrongdoing. Any
   one of the numerous freebies would be bad enough, but taken together
   they rise to the level of stupid and self-serving, if not illegal. the
   Gov has been around money so much, big donors, etc that he starts to
   think like them. It is a certain carelessness that infects some of the
   rich and easily rubs off on their lackeys, like the Gov. The disease is
   not unique to Republicans, but one should remember that they have been
   the party of the rich for more than 100 years. In a democracy, we get
   the government we deserve.
