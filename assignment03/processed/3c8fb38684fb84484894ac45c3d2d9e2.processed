The building blocks of planets

Twin Chilean telescopes will team with NASA spacecraft to hunt distant
objects

   September 12, 2013 | Editor's Pick
   Clay_922

   Igor Chilingarian/Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

   The Magellan telescope (pictured) christened "Clay" after astronomer
   Landon Clay, a Harvard graduate and philanthropist, is one of the two
   large Magellan telescopes at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.
   By Colleen Walsh, Harvard Staff Writer

   This is the fifth in a [83]series of stories about Harvard's engagement
   in Latin America.

   "We don't send anyone through here without a personal guide," joked
   Matt Holman as he led a visitor through a maze of corridors and
   crossways at the [84]Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA)
   in Cambridge.

   But a personal guide of sorts is exactly what a group of astronomers,
   with help from Holman, a lecturer on astrophysics at Harvard, and his
   collaborators at the [85]Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in
   Colorado will be happy to have in two years while piggybacking on a
   [86]National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spaceship that
   is racing to the farthest edges of the solar system.

   Scientists tend not to joke when it comes to navigating their celestial
   territory, and that includes Holman and Alex Parker, a former
   postdoctoral fellow at the CfA's [87]Institute for Theory and
   Computation, who are part of a mission to find an object in the
   far-flung Kuiper Belt. They'll work on that with the help of SwRI's
   Marc Buie and a number of massive telescopes, including two large
   [88]Magellan telescopes at the [89]Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.

   "The Kuiper Belt objects are the building blocks of planets," explained
   Holman, senior astrophysicist with the [90]Smithsonian Astrophysical
   Observatory and associate director of the CfA's Theoretical
   Astrophysics Division, who specializes in the study of extrasolar
   planetary systems. "They are relatively primordial, and this may be our
   only opportunity for us to see one of these objects up close."

   To do that, Holman's team is hitching a ride on NASA's [91]New Horizons
   spacecraft, which will blaze past Pluto on its exploratory mission of
   the dwarf planet sometime in 2015 at more than 30,000 miles per hour.
   After completion of the Pluto mission, Holman's SwRI partners,
   including New Horizon's principal investigator, Alan Stern, will give
   NASA the green light to fire the ship's rockets. They will redirect the
   craft by roughly one degree, and blast into unexplored territory past
   an object in the distant Kuiper Belt, a vast region composed of icy
   fragments, leftovers from the solar system's creation 4.5 billion years
   ago.

   Mounted on the back of the Clay telescope is Megacam, a giant digital
   camera whose construction was led by CfA astrophysicist Brian McLeod.

   scientists will then explore with the help of NASA's spacecraft New
   Horizons. Courtesy of Brian McLeod

   These fragments could reveal much about the makeup of the universe, but
   finding one is no easy task. Before the NASA craft makes its pass by
   Pluto, the research team has to pinpoint where to direct the vehicle.

   "Magellan comes into play because it has superb image quality," said
   Holman, referring to the twin 6.5-meter telescopes located 200 feet
   apart on a remote mountaintop in Chile's southern Atacama Desert. The
   telescopes, christened Baade and Clay after astronomers Walter Baade
   and Landon Clay, a Harvard graduate and philanthropist, are part of the
   Magellan Project, a collaboration among [92]Harvard University, the
   [93]Carnegie Institution for Science, the [94]University of Arizona,
   the [95]University of Michigan, and the [96]Massachusetts Institute of
   Technology. Magellan's sophisticated design includes main mirrors
   consisting of 21,000 pounds of borosilicate glass supported by a
   lightweight honeycomb structure.

   One of the massive telescopes is equipped with what sounds like a
   superhero gadget: Megacam, a giant digital camera whose construction
   was led by CfA astrophysicist Brian McLeod. Mounted on the back of the
   Clay telescope, it's armed with a 24-foot-by-24-foot field of view and
   offers researchers 36 times as many pixels as a high-end consumer
   digital camera.

   In short, it snaps really, really good pictures.

   "It doesn't matter that you can take a picture that's extremely sharp
   if you don't have a camera that has enough pixels to record that image
   quality," said Holman. "Megacam really makes that possible."

   Parker has developed a means of subtracting stellar light from the
   pictures captured by Megacam, which in turn allows researchers to home
   in on the faint moving objects and track their exact locations. Over
   the past couple of years, he has been busy trying to identify Kuiper
   Belt objects.

   "Once you've measured an object's location over a period of time, you
   can measure its orbit around the sun. And that's what we need," said
   Parker, who this month became a planetary scientist at the
   [97]University of California, Berkeley, but will continue to work on
   the Kuiper Belt project. "We need to know its orbit around the sun so
   we can predict where it will be in the future and whether or not our
   spacecraft will fly to it."

   Like Magellan's finely tuned instruments, the telescopes' location will
   also factor in the team's success. The site's mountaintop setting,
   perched on the edge of the ocean, far removed from a major metropolis,
   sets up an astronomer's dream: "good seeing."

   Researchers are limited to searching only a fraction of the sky that
   will be close to the craft's altered trajectory. In addition, the
   objects they are looking for are fainter and "necessarily smaller
   because there aren't that many big ones" in the Kuiper Belt, said
   Holman. Complicating their efforts is the fact that Pluto is currently
   emerging from its proximity to the Milky Way, whose billions of glowing
   stars make tiny, faint moving objects in the nearby Kuiper Belt even
   harder to see.

   Any amateur stargazer knows that light pollution dramatically hinders
   observations in the night sky. Las Campanas' remote locale means it's
   unencumbered by excess light. The region's drier climate also means
   less water vapor in the air, and the breeze off the ocean, undisturbed
   by preceding mountain ridges, flows smoothly. Such weather conditions
   greatly reduce the chance of atmospheric interference, an astronomer's
   worst fear.

   While beautiful to most, twinkling stars are "bad news" for the
   researchers, said Holman. "It means [the light] is dancing around in
   the atmosphere. That twinkling means how much light you are getting is
   changing and its position is changing, and that means that if you take
   a picture, it's going to be more blurred. At Las Campanas ... image
   quality can be fantastic, the seeing can be wonderful, and that's
   really helpful when you want to look for fainter objects."

   Thus far, Holman and his colleagues have identified a handful of faint
   objects in the Kuiper Belt that might be in the right patch of sky when
   New Horizons passes by Pluto in 2015. In the coming months, they will
   analyze their data "to refine our understanding of their orbits to be
   sure that they are good candidates," said Holman.

   "We are hoping the data we collect in the next month or so," he added,
   "will really turn up what we are looking for."
