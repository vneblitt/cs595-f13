   Miley and Liam
   OVERT SIGNS OF SPLIT
   Breaking Engagement
   0915_liam_miley_getty2 It's one thing not to be seen together, but when
   you unfollow someone on Twitter it's pretty clear ... Miley Cyrus and
   Liam Hemsworth are dunzo.
   Miley 86'd Liam from the social media site yesterday.  He's still
   following her, but it takes 2 to follow in a fiance sort of way.
   Miley and Liam have barely been seen together in the last few months,
   and when they were they looked like they were in pain.
   Was Liam pissed at Miley's twerking video?  Was he upset with what she
   was wearing at the VMAs?  Was he infuriated at what she did to Robin
   Thicke?
   So much to be pissed over.
   update_bar
   1:40 PM PT -- Adding more fuel to the fire ... Liam was spotted out
   last night in Vegas at the Mayweather fight sitting near "Twilight"
   star Ashley Greene.

   Miley and Justin: destined to crash and burn. An all too familiar story
   among those who made it big when very young. Too bad, but not my
   problem.

   He can do so much better than that twerking bimbo that can't keep her
   tongue in her mouth. I felt sorry for him. He must have been soo
   embarrassed!

   Maybe he's just sick of her like every normal person is? She is beyond
   tacky and everything she does screams desperation.

   It's hard taking back seat to a partner who is much more successful
   than you. Poor Liam, forever in the shadow. First his brother, now his
   girlfriend. Meanwhile, Miley is laughing all the way to the bank.
