The Syria Saga, Explained

   September 9, 2013
   By Christina Pazzanese, Harvard Gazette

   As Congress was considering whether the United States should take
   military action in Syria against the regime of President Bashar Assad
   for allegedly using chemical weapons against civilians, Harvard Gazette
   staff writer Christina Pazzanese spoke with [70]R. Nicholas Burns, the
   Sultan of Oman Professor of International Relations at Harvard Kennedy
   School (HKS), about the unsettled situation and the military,
   political, and humanitarian actions that the United States and some
   allies might undertake in a Mideast nation torn by civil war.
   Q: What's at stake for Syria in this civil war? And what's at stake for
   the world community if tactics such as civilian gassing are allowed?
   Burns: Well, it's of vital interest to the United States to see that
   chemical weapons are not used in the world. We have adhered to chemical
   weapons treaties since just after the First World War, and there's been
   a prohibition for nearly a century on the use of chemical weapons in
   peacetime or in war. If Assad has now used chemical weapons -- and the
   evidence is very strong that he has, the administration has mounted a
   very convincing case of that -- then the chemical weapons genie will be
   out of the bottle. What's to stop other dictators from using chemical
   weapons if there's no effective international response? So, in effect,
   what President [Barack] Obama is proposing is to enforce international
   law, the chemical weapons convention, by striking at Syria's military
   assets, its airfields, its air force, its command and control, its
   artillery, to intimidate him and to deter him from ever using chemical
   weapons again, and warning that should he use chemical weapons, there
   will be another response. I think that's the heart of the issue now
   that President Obama has put before the country.
   Q: Why would Assad and his military use poison gas when it's the one
   weapon that might bring down the wrath of the world on him,
   particularly since he seems to be winning the civil war at this point?
   Burns: I was shocked when I first saw the reports in August, the third
   week of August, of a chemical weapons attack, because actually U.N.
   weapons inspectors were in Syria that week, so it did not stand to
   reason, it didn't seem to me, to be in his interest to use chemical
   weapons. And yet the evidence that the Obama administration has put
   forward is, I think, convincing that in fact they did. This might have
   been a decision by military commanders who are outside the political
   chain of command. It could have been a local commander who ordered the
   use. We know that Assad has used chemical weapons in the past against
   civilian populations. So he may think or they may think they can get
   away with it. They may think the United States and Europe are paper
   tigers and aren't going to respond. And that's why President Obama and
   Sen. John McCain have both said the credibility of the United States is
   on the line because we said, as a country -- President Obama said a
   year ago -- that if Assad used chemical weapons, we'd respond. Well,
   he's used chemical weapons, so we now have to respond.
   Q: Is there good reason for Assad to be worried about losing power, or
   are the rebel factions too fractured to unseat him on their own?
   Burns: There's a standoff right now, and part of the tragedy of this
   civil war is that it's gone on so long because the two sides are evenly
   matched, evenly balanced. The victim of that paralysis and balance has
   been the civilian population of Syria. One hundred thousand people
   dead, several million people now homeless. This is a humanitarian
   crisis that is approaching what we saw in the Balkans in the 1990s, in
   Bosnia and Kosovo. So it doesn't seem right now that there's any way
   for the rebels to win. They're not quite strong enough or united enough
   to win. Assad is just strong enough to survive. Something has to happen
   to change that balance.
   Q: What is the U.S. interest in this conflict?
   Burns: I think we have a combination of moral and strategic interests.
   Syria really matters to the United States because of where it is. It is
   in many ways the keystone state of the Levant. Its neighbors are our
   friends: Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq. So a widening of the
   war, which many people fear, would have a direct impact on countries
   that are very, very important to the United States. So strategically,
   it's important.
   It's also important strategically because the main backers of the Assad
   regime are Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia, all adversaries of the United
   States. And so it wouldn't be in the interest of the United States or
   Israel or the Arab countries to see an increase in Iranian or Hezbollah
   power, for instance, in that key part of the Arab world. So that's one
   interest.
   Q: What might be the best- and worst-case outcomes?
   Burns: It's hard to make a case for a best, positive outcome in Syria
   because all the signs are bad. A best-case outcome would be limited
   airstrikes targeted against the military in Syria that don't have an
   impact on civilians, that would intimidate and deter the Syrian
   government from using these weapons again. Another best-case outcome
   was that somehow a show of force by the United States might lead the
   Syrian government and the Russian government and the Iranian government
   to conclude that they do need a cease-fire. That's a best-case outcome.
   I think the objective probability, however, is that we're going to see
   a continuation of the worst case: that the war will continue, the two
   sides will not be able to gain victory, thus the fighting continues,
   civilians suffer, the U.S. and Russia remain opposed to each other, and
   the war goes on. That's the worst case, and, unfortunately, that's the
   likelier outcome, I think. [71]read more
