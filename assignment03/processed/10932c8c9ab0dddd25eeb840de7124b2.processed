Playtime is Over, Paris Hilton -- Maybe It's Time to Grow Up Now

   Oh, Paris Hilton. When are you going to finally resign to the fact that
   you're not 19 years old anymore? Girl, you look great, and that's not
   even the question here, but maybe you should focus more on figuring out
   what you're going to do with the rest of your life rather than choosing
   to pal around with a dude who makes major money photographing young,
   in-the-minute men and women. Maybe you could stop riding the coattails
   of your family fortune and quit trying to make the DJ-ing and
   record-making happen, because it's not going to happen. Pull an "Eat,
   Pray, Love" and get on with yourself -- if for no one else but you
   alone, you owe it to the universe to make a change.
   Seriously, girl, take a look at your some of your old friends -- Nicole
   Richie, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears ... are you really going to be
   the very last one to grow up out of all of them? Huh? Come on now.
   You're (probably) better than this.

   lmao, you creeple are funny. you act like she should go move into a
   tent with a shopping cart on skidrow, just because her family is rich.
   how many of your parents kicked you out the home and told you to live
   on skidrow, because 'that was your family's fortune' and you have no
   right to take from it? ya'll are some HYPOCRITES. it's her fortune.
   that is why rich people have HEIRS (aka CHILDREN!). TO IN-HEIR-IT THEIR
   FORTUNE YOU IDIOTS. NOT LOOK AT IT THROUGH A BULLET PROOF GLASS WINDOW.

   Dearest Sarah Taylor Spangenberg,

   Bullying again I see? Tsk, tsk.

   Good old Harvey Levin waxes poetic about how great Paris is. You know
   that right? He goes on and on about how her fragrance line alone has
   made 1 BILLION dollars. He talks about how amazing her transformation
   is and how her being a very in demand DJ is incredible.

   Then I come here and you are putting her down and making fun of her.

   Yeah, you really have the pulse of what people think. Maybe you are the
   one stuck in the 90s?

   I am laughing so hard at the comments about how people want to bang
   her. I still remember her prescription for Valtrex and genital herpes
   diagnoses that was found in her storage locker.

   Good luck with that, fellas.

   Sarah, there is no reason to shame this woman. We include everyone in
   our society these days regardless if you like it or not. You don't get
   to say ugly things to a woman and get away with it because you are a
   woman. If you have an issue by all means state it but there is no need
   to create shame. I am not considered a fan however I'm sure her family
   and friends love her.

   Terry Richardson is a really sick guy. It is amazing that celebrities
   do NOT care about what this man has been accused of doing. He has a
   blog where he photographed his sexual exploits with VERY young, naive
   girls who want to be models. Even one Maybelline model lashed out at a
   poor girl who felt victimized by Terry. Google up model Charlotte Free
   --- and see how she joined in on the sexist drivel Terry spews.

   He's a piece of cr*p.... and don't tell me that Paris, Miley, Lindsay
   and all the other low-lifes who have worked with him -don't know that..
   Paris and company-- are helping him promote himself even more --
   thereby ensnaring more female victims....

   Any female with an ounce of integrity would NOT even consider working
   with this piece of slime.

   Paris has the herp, and Terry Richardson's cock is 10" long.

   Hey,

   If these dumb cunts keep letting him photograph them doing dirty
   things, who gives a shit.

   Here' one of his photos, I think that's Dakota Fanning, if I know my
   starlets.

   UGH Terry Richardson. He needs to go away and very fast. He directed
   "Wrecking Ball" I believe too. This is the story I read and was
   completely horrified that people still let him in the industry:
