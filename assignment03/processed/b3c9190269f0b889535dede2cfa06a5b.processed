   BLACKSBURG, Va., Aug. 2, 2013 - A Virginia Tech [160]Department of
   Aerospace and Ocean Engineering student team from recently took first
   place in the 2013 Revolutionary Aerospace Systems Concepts-Academic
   Linkage - or RASC-AL, for short -competition.

   The team captured three first place slots, including the Human-Focused
   Mars Mission Systems and Technologies category; the undergraduate level
   competition; and the overall competition award. Having captured
   [161]third place overall in 2012, the team's theme this year was
   Project Rhea: A Manned Reusable Spacecraft for the Scientific
   Observation of Mars, and focused on a fuel-saving fusion rocket.

   Sponsored by NASA and managed by the National Institute of Aerospace,
   the Cocoa Beach, Fla.-set design competition tasks university students
   with solving the myriad quandaries - environmental factors, choice of
   vehicle, fuel source and usage, and return trip home -- associated with
   a human-based mission to Mars.

   Team members include Divyanshu Agarwal of Norfolk, Va.; Dan Corio of
   Mt. Airy, Md.; Ben Massey of Spotsylvania, Va.; Jacob McGee of Parrott,
   Va.; Juan Ojeda of Ashburn, Va.; Isaac Root of Fredericksburg, Va.; and
   Evan Schrantz of Radford, Va. All members graduated in May with
   bachelor's degrees in aerospace engineering, part of the College of
   Engineering.

   The competition effort is part of two 4000-level engineering courses
   with the aerospace department, both taught by [162]Kevin Shinpaugh,
   director of information technology and computing services for the
   [163]Virginia Bioinformatics Institute and an adjunct professor in the
   aerospace department.
   "We drew on current plans and designs from other sources to accurately
   work these environments into our overall architecture," said McGee,
   student team leader. "We spent a semester and a half on it, and many of
   the things that went into our architecture, such as health and
   radiation concerns, are not something we cover in class. We really had
   to expand our knowledge on our own time, and hold ourselves accountable
   for the quality of our work."

   Teams submit a written report, prepare a poster, and give an oral
   presentation, and also must formulate an education outreach program for
   younger students in primary and secondary schools, including real-world
   impact of the mission on common-day life. The team has regularly
   presented its theme to the Virginia Tech hosted [164]Kids' Tech
   University as part of this component.

   The team is not done with the mission-to-Mars project yet. They will
   take their presentation this year's American Institute of Aeronautics
   and Astronautics Space 2013 Conference, slated for fall. Shinpaugh said
   each year's team in the competition starts from scratch on design and
   presentation. "I want them to see the whole design process," he said.

   The [165]College of Engineering at Virginia Tech is internationally
   recognized for its excellence in 14 engineering disciplines and
   computer science. The college's 6,000 undergraduates benefit from an
   innovative curriculum that provides a "hands-on, minds-on" approach to
   engineering education, complementing classroom instruction with two
   unique design-and-build facilities and a strong Cooperative Education
   Program. With more than 50 research centers and numerous laboratories,
   the college offers its 2,000 graduate students opportunities in
   advanced fields of study such as biomedical engineering,
   state-of-the-art microelectronics, and nanotechnology. Virginia Tech,
   the most comprehensive university in Virginia, is dedicated to quality,
   innovation, and results to the commonwealth, the nation, and the world.

   The contest required entrants to design, and produce a business plan
   for a commercial Earth-to-orbit passenger vehicle. Among the tasks: The
   theoretical vehicle should take paying customers from Earth to orbit
   and back for a variety of research and tourism purposes.
