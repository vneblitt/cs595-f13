   Attorney General Eric Holder (Wikipedia)

Research Findings

   In August 2013, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder [110]made headlines
   when he asserted that new approaches were needed in prosecuting
   low-level drug-related crimes, with the goal of lowering incarceration
   rates and reducing the overcrowding of prisons, among other things.

   Whatever the effectiveness of the wave of "get tough" laws of the last
   several decades, one result has been staggering rates of incarceration
   in the United States: Research has shown that since 1973 the U.S.
   prison population has increased more than seven-fold; a [111]full 1% of
   the U.S. adult population has been behind bars. "Mandatory minimum" and
   [112]"fixed sentence" laws have played a role in this increase, with
   considerable discretion taken out of the hands of local prosecutors and
   judges, even for non-violent offenses. Recent data show a [113]slight
   decrease in the U.S. prison population, but nearly 1.5 million people
   remain incarcerated at the federal or state level in this country.

   Holder's policy proposal cuts against earlier trends toward
   "federalizing" many offenses. Instead, local prosecutors and
   communities would be encouraged to work together to set priorities and
   find more tailored solutions to public-safety issues. Such approaches
   fall under the banner "community justice" or [114]"community
   prosecution." In general they refer to efforts to more closely align
   enforcement efforts with community interests and concerns. Rather than
   being judged by the number of cases they process and the length of
   sentences obtained, prosecutors instead work with local groups to
   address residents' concerns and seek solutions to prevent crimes. The
   strategy shares some features with [115]"order maintenance" policing
   and also grew out of the "broken windows" strategy of crime control.

   Well before Holder's call to action, a number of U.S. municipalities
   and regions experimented with more closely connecting prosecution
   efforts with citizens' concerns. As detailed in the 1998 book Community
   Justice: An Emerging Field, the city of Portland, Oregon, [116]was an
   early proponent of the approach, starting in 1990. Holder himself
   [117]applied similar strategies in Washington, D.C., in the 1990s when
   he was in the U.S. Attorney's Office, and the issue came up during his
   [118]2009 confirmation hearings. It has also been implemented in cities
   such as [119]Baltimore, which reorganized its prosecutors in geographic
   zones last year, as well as rural areas such as [120]South Dakota's
   Indian reservations.

   Despite a surge of interest in community prosecution practices, the
   question of their effectiveness remains open. To better understand this
   issue, Thomas J. Miles of the University of Chicago analyzed 15 years
   of data over a period during which the city alternately did and didn't
   apply community-prosecution strategies in certain neighborhoods. "This
   sequence of two `off/on' policy episodes permits plausible
   identification of the strategy's impact," Miles writes, as it created a
   kind of natural experiment in which potentially confounding variables
   were filtered out.

   The resulting study, [121]"Does the `Community Prosecution' Strategy
   Reduce Crime? A Test of Chicago's Experience," was published in
   American Law and Economics Review in August 2013. Its findings include:
     * When community prosecution approaches were in force, the largest
       decline was in violent crimes such as murder, rape and aggravated
       assaults. "Perhaps the most impressive is the statistically
       significant decline of nearly 8% in aggravated assault, the offense
       that, in most years, constitutes more than half of all violent
       crimes."
     * Property and quality-of-life crimes also dropped, but the declines
       were smaller and not statistically significant. This is a
       contradiction of the "broken windows" concept, which theorizes that
       quality-of-life crimes should decline first, leading to subsequent
       reductions in more serious offenses.
     * The decreases in violent crimes and those against property were
       immediate and stable, also a contradiction of the "broken windows"
       theory: "Within the first year of introducing the strategy, the
       point estimates for violent and property crime are each about -0.04
       [a coefficient], where they remain for the next four or five
       years." At the same time, minor crimes were little affected.
     * Looking at the implied financial value of reductions in violent and
       property crime -- for example, a murder was estimated to impose a
       societal burden of approximately $8.9 million -- the study found
       that community prosecution strategies provided net benefits.
       "Although this is a ballpark calculation, the benefits appear to
       exceed the costs by several multiples."

   "The diversity of practices under the rubric of community prosecution
   makes generalization difficult, but the estimates from Chicago show
   that the strategy has the potential to produce cost-justified
   reductions in crime," Miles writes. At the same time, "it leaves out
   important potential benefits, such as improvements in residents'
   perceptions of public safety, and potential costs, such as longer
   periods of incarceration for specific neighborhood offenders."

Teaching Notes

Analysis assignments

   Read the issue-related Baltimore Sun article titled [123]"Baltimore to
   Overhaul Prosecution Strategy."
    1. What key insights from the news article and the study in this
       lesson should reporters be aware of as they cover these issues?

   Read the full study titled [124]"Does the 'Community Prosecution'
   Strategy Reduce Crime? A Test of Chicago's Experience."
    1. What are the study's key technical terms? Which ones need to be put
       into language a lay audience can understand?
    2. Do the study's authors put the research into context and show how
       they are advancing the state of knowledge about the subject? If so,
       what did the previous research indicate?
    3. What is the study's research method? If there are statistical
       results, how did the scholars arrive at them?
    4. Evaluate the study's limitations. (For example, are there
       weaknesses in the study's data or research design?)
    5. How could the findings be misreported or misinterpreted by a
       reporter? In other words, what are the difficulties in conveying
       the data accurately? Give an example of a faulty headline or story
       lead.

   Newswriting and digital reporting assignments
    1. Write a lead, headline or nut graph based on the study.
    2. Spend 60 minutes exploring the issue by accessing sources of
       information other than the study. Write a lead (or headline or nut
       graph) based on the study but informed by the new information. Does
       the new information significantly change what one would write based
       on the study alone?
    3. Compose two Twitter messages of 140 characters or fewer accurately
       conveying the study's findings to a general audience. Make sure to
       use appropriate hashtags.
    4. Choose several key quotations from the study and show how they
       would be set up and used in a brief blog post.
    5. Map out the structure for a 60-second video segment about the
       study. What combination of study findings and visual aids could be
       used?
    6. Find pictures and graphics that might run with a story about the
       study. If appropriate, also find two related videos to embed in an
       online posting. Be sure to evaluate the credibility and
       appropriateness of any materials you would aggregate and repurpose.

   Class discussion questions
    1. What is the study's most important finding?
    2. Would members of the public intuitively understand the study's
       findings? If not, what would be the most effective way to relate
       them?
    3. What kinds of knowledgeable sources you would interview to report
       the study in context?
    4. How could the study be "localized" and shown to have community
       implications?
    5. How might the study be explained through the stories of
       representative individuals? What kinds of people might a reporter
       feature to make such a story about the study come alive?
    6. What sorts of stories might be generated out of secondary
       information or ideas discussed in the study?
