   NEW YORK (Reuters) - Public Advocate Bill de Blasio won the most votes
   in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary on Tuesday, according
   to exit polls reported by local media.

   The results did not show whether de Blasio had secured the 40 percent
   of votes needed to avert a runoff with the second-place candidate in
   the race, according to exit polls cited by The New York Times and NY1
   television.
