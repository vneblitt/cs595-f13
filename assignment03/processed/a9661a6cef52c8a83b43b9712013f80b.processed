   Chicago Blackhawk Patrick Kane said Friday that all the stickhandling
   in the commercial he shot for Bauer was real, except for the end where
   the puck supposedly breaks the camera.

   "At first I didn't think I was going to be able to do it with all the
   pucks in there," Kane said.

   "When they had the idea and they told me how many pucks were going to
   be in the center I was like, `I don't know if I could do it.' I tried
   it with a few and said, `why not throw all of them in there and see if
   I can do it?' It was cool, it was fun."

   Kane said it took between 15 and 20 minutes to finish. "At first I
   didn't think I was going to be able to do it with all the pucks in
   there but I guess as you get into it and get competitive, you want to
   try it out," he said.
