Veteran soldier dies while taking physical fitness exam

   By Jennifer Delgado Tribune reporter

   3:16 p.m. CDT, September 16, 2013

   An Illinois Guardsman of 11 years from south suburban Riverdale who
   died while taking a physical fitness test was a role model who worked
   hard to provide for his four young daughters, colleagues said.

   Sgt. 1st Class Jerome W. Baker, 29, of the Illinois Army National Guard
   was running for his semiannual fitness test Friday when he stopped
   during a two-mile trek at a Michigan training center and sat down.

   Realizing he needed help, Baker's colleagues called 911. He was en
   route to Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Mich., when he died, according to
   a spokesman for the Illinois Guard. An official cause of death has not
   been given.

   "Jerome served with the Illinois National Guard for 11 years building a
   reputation as an intelligent noncommissioned officer and mentor," said
   Brig. Gen. Daniel M. Krumrei, the guard's adjutant general, in a
   statement. "He was well-respected and admired by his fellow soldiers,
   subordinates and leaders."

   Baker joined the service at 18 but was not like other young soldiers,
   said Kevin Bonds, a master sergeant who knew him well. Baker was
   focused and knowledgeable and could work in all kinds of situations, he
   said.

   "He said one of the biggest things was he just wanted to be a great
   father to his children," said Bonds, who worked alongside Baker for a
   few years. "As far as the military was concerned, he just wanted to be
   a good leader."

   Outside of work, Baker liked to rap. It started out as a hobby but
   became a passion over time as Baker performed and shot videos that
   featured his rhymes. He often talked about pursuing rap as a career
   after the military, Bonds said.

   A full-time soldier, Baker did two tours in Germany, according to the
   guard.

   He received a promotion almost a year ago to noncommissioned officer in
   charge of readiness for Company G, 634th Brigade Support Battalion,
   33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team. He oversaw the day-to-day operations
   of his unit, which maintained military vehicles and trailers, Bonds
   said.

   When young black men needed guidance or someone to look up to, Bonds
   said, he would always point them to Baker, who loved his job and was
   good at it.

   "A lot of time you hear people say, 'This person was one of the good
   ones.' Jerome was definitely one of the good ones," Bonds said. "This
   is a huge, huge loss."

   Services are planned 11:30 a.m. Friday at Gatling's Chapel, Inc., 10133
   S. Halsted St. in Chicago, according to a release from the Illinois
   National Guard.
