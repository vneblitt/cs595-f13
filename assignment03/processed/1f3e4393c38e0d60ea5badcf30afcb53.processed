How Trello Showcased Their Mobile App with Video

   Ben McCormack serves customers and makes videos for [18]Trello at
   [19]Fog Creek Software. Trello is an intuitive collaboration tool that
   organizes your projects into boards, lists, and cards. You can reach
   Ben at [20]ben@benmccormack.com.

   [EMBED] Fog Creek: Shooting Video of Mobile Devices

   We've made two videos to showcase our mobile apps for Trello, and
   wanted to share our experience with the process. The video above shares
   some production techniques that we learned while setting up a camera
   and lighting to shoot video of a mobile device. The post below is going
   to cover some of the thought process that went on behind the scenes.

  Trello for iPad

   IFRAME: [21]wistia_embed

   Our decision to produce a video for the launch of the Trello iPad app
   came after we watched the [22]Mailbox app video. We learned from the
   Mailbox team that they produced the video in-house. Their video was
   amazingly successful, and was likely a major factor leading up to their
   [23]eventual acquisition by Dropxbox. Our aspirations weren't so
   ambitious, but we were encouraged to try our hand at video.

   We did the requisite Googling for "how to shoot video of mobile," but
   didn't find a lot of helpful information (this is surprisingly
   difficult. You really have to play with your search query to get
   results that show making video of an iPad, and not with an iPad). This
   meant we had to learn a lot as we went along.

   Making a video for the first time was quite challenging, but I was
   surprised at how quickly we were able to overcome a lot of the
   technical challenges and come up with a final product (I finished the
   editing within [24]Premiere Pro's free trial period). There is a wealth
   of information available online to learn how to work with video.

   Apple decided to feature the Trello iPhone app while we were still
   finishing up the iPad appâan amazing opportunity, but this also meant
   that we had to hurry to finish the video so we could release the iPad
   app. Given more time, we might have touched up the video some more (for
   example, we might have made it shorter), but it made more sense to ship
   what we had while we were still being featured in the App Store.

    Additional resources from the Trello for iPad video:

     * [25]Trello App Store listing
     * The [26]Trello board we used to track shots and stay organized
     * Camera we used: [27]Canon 7D
     * Camera we could have used: Canon Rebel (T2i and up) with [28]50mm
       lens

  Trello for Android

   IFRAME: [29]//www.youtube.com/embed/_b5ad_ED72w?rel=0

   The first thing you'll notice about the Trello for Android video,
   compared to the Trello for iPad video, is that it's much more direct.
   The phone and app are front and center. There are no actors, and the
   only narrative is what you pick up from the user interface. If you're
   shooting your first video of a mobile device, I'd recommend leaning in
   the direction of how we shot the Android video. Point the camera at the
   device and show what it does.

   Even though the approach to this video was more simple, I still ended
   up having to make two videos in order to come up with something we felt
   we could ship. I'll admit that I was pretty proud of the [30]first
   version of the video. Although I learned a ton in the process, I
   quickly latched on to a few of the techniques that I wanted to use and
   had trouble distancing myself from them when I was finished.

   When you're close to your work, it's easy to get married to it and
   become blind to its flaws. It took some honest, hard-to-swallow
   criticism from colleagues to convince me to edit the video.

   The second version of the video (the version embedded above) ended up
   being much better, and I was glad to have made the edits. When working
   with video--especially when getting started--try to emotionally
   distance yourself from your work so that you can look at it with fresh
   eyes. This might mean taking a few days away from your video editor and
   coming back to it with a list of your original goals in hand.

   Throw away the cruft that interrupts the flow of the video, even if
   that means removing a scene that took you a day and a half to edit.
   Most importantly, be prepared to receive criticism, and try not to take
   it personally. Remember, the reason your friends and colleagues are
   giving you their honest feedback is that they, like you, ultimately
   want the video to succeed!

    Additional resources from the Trello for Android video:

     * [31]Trello for Android Google Play store listing
     * Camera: Canon T4i with 50mm f1.4 lens
     * Tripod we used: [32]Manfrotto 055XPROB Legs with [33]Manfrotto
       MVH500AH Head
     * Any tripod with a center column that swivels 90Â° would likely work
       ([34]like this)
     * We used a [35]cheap lighting kit from ePhoto, but could've used the
       [36]Down & Dirty Lighting Kit
     * [37]Modeling clay to keep the phone in place
     * [38]PlaceIt by Breezi for quick mobile screenshot mock-ups

   One of the benefits of creating the Trello for iPad video in-house was
   the experience we gained producing and editing video. We could
   certainly have hired someone to make the video for us, but then we
   would have missed out on the knowledge that eventually informed the
   Trello for Android video. With each video we produce, we learn
   something that makes the next one better.

   P.S.: Music for the Trello for Android video and top how-to video is by
   [39]Brian Cervino. He works at Fog Creek and also composes music.

   What techniques have you used to shoot device screens effectively? How
   do you showcase your app with video? What companies have you seen doing
   a great job with this?

[49]Use a Laptop and Chair as a Teleprompter

   [50]Speaking into a traditional teleprompter can make you sound like a
   robot. One way to sound more human: grab your laptop, borrow a chair,
   and set the two up in front of your camera. Sure, it may not look like
   a work of art. But...
