Virginia Tech Board of Visitors approves 2013-14 university budget
     __________________________________________________________________

   BLACKSBURG, Va., June 3, 2013 - At its quarterly meeting held today in
   Blacksburg, the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors approved several
   resolutions that will establish the 2013-14 university budget.

   In the coming fiscal year (July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2014), Virginia
   Tech will adopt an approximately $1.28 billion budget to carry out all
   of its programs, a $73.7 million increase over the current year budget.

   Included in next year's budget are state funds to support planning for
   the Academic Buildings Renewal project, construction funding for the
   Classroom Building, and preplanning funds for the Improve Kentland
   Facilities project, as well as $9.7 in state funding to support
   compensation adjustments.

   The board honored both Patricia Dove, C.P. Miles Professor of Science
   in Geosciences, and X.J. Meng, professor of Molecular Virology in the
   Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology in the
   Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, by naming
   them University Distinguished Professors. The university distinguished
   professorship is a pre-eminent faculty rank bestowed by the board upon
   members of the faculty whose scholarly attainments have attracted
   national and/or international recognition. The professorship is to be
   bestowed upon no more than one percent of the total full-time faculty
   at any time.

   Complete stories on [160]Patricia Dove and [161]X.J. Meng will appear
   Tuesday's edition of Virginia Tech News.

   In other news, the board approved a resolution to create a new
   [162]Doctor of Philosophy Degree in translational biology, medicine,
   and health. This new program, which will be the only degree program in
   Virginia to cover this range of biomedical and health-related subjects,
   will be the subject of a news story in Virginia Tech News later this
   week.

   The board also approved resolutions to establish a new Master of Arts
   in Education Degree and a new Ph.D. in higher education. The existing
   master's and doctoral degree programs in educational leadership and
   policy studies has two distinct tracks - educational leadership for
   K-12 educators and administrators, and higher education for student
   affairs practitioners in a collegiate setting. Because the two tracks
   share no coursework, faculty, or students, creating a separate degree
   in higher education will allow for meaningful and important
   system-level tracking of applications, enrollments, individual student
   progress and completions, and other information necessary for program
   evaluation and improvement.

   Resolutions to establish three new Bachelor of Science Degree programs
   -- in sustainable biomaterials, packaging systems, and fish and
   wildlife conservation -- based in the College of Natural Resources and
   Environment were also approved. These degree programs respond to the
   growing complexity of sustainability issues and the growing need for
   professional who can effectively understand and address these issues
   for local, state and federal government agencies, non-profit groups, as
   well as the private sector.

   The board also approved a resolution to discontinue the Bachelor of
   Arts degree in interdisciplinary studies effective in 2017.

   The board approved resolutions to demolish Brodie and Rashe halls to
   pave the way to build new residence halls for students in the Virginia
   Tech Corps of Cadets to be located where the existing halls currently
   stand. At the March board meeting, members received a report on the
   [163]overall redesign of the Upper Quad area.

   Members of the Buildings and Grounds committee received an update on
   the proposed Classroom Building Project to be located near the corner
   of West Campus Drive and Perry Street. The proposed 73,000 gross square
   foot, three story building would include combinations of dividable and
   flexible arrangement, medium size classrooms, large dividable
   classrooms, large size tiered and large size scale-up classrooms,
   multiple interdisciplinary science instructional labs, and multiple
   open and private study rooms. The project is part a broader plan to
   develop what is being referred to as the "North Precinct" where the
   parking garage and Signature Engineering Building are located.

   A more comprehensive story on the proposed classroom building the North
   Precinct development will be published in Virginia Tech News next week.

   A resolution to revise the university's Policy on Intellectual
   Property, which had not been substantially updated since 1991, was
   approved, as were resolutions authorizing modifications to the abusive
   conduct policy, the drug policy, and the unauthorized entry policy for
   the Student Code of Conduct.

   On Sunday, the Research Committee received a report on the university's
   involvement on the National Science Foundation I-Corps Mid-Atlantic
   Regional Node which will help scientists and engineers to broaden the
   impact of federally funded research and bring discoveries to market. A
   report on the recent activities and future goals of the Institute for
   Creativity, Arts, and Technology was also shared with board members.

   Seven current faculty members were appointed or reappointed to endowed
   professorship or fellowships. Stories on each of these individuals, as
   well as five individuals who were recognized with emeritus status, will
   appear in [164]Virginia Tech News beginning Wednesday, June 5.

   The next full Virginia Tech Board of Visitors meeting will be held
   Sept. 8 through 9, 2013, in Blacksburg. More information on the
   [165]Virginia Tech Board of Visitors may be found online.
