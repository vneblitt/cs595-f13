Atop the Amazon rainforest

   Scot Martin and a team of researchers study how pristine air becomes
   polluted, and how that may change the climate (Harvard Gazette)

     __________________________________________________________________

   MANAUS, Brazil -- Walking along a path in the Amazon rainforest,
   several overheated travelers come across a copper-colored brook
   rippling under a mossy wooden bridge. It's an inviting sight. But the
   beckoning waters could well camouflage a deadly predator.

   "The huge snake the anaconda loves to stay in these small rivers," said
   Bruno Takeshi, a tall, unflappable Brazilian, referring to the massive
   reptile that squeezes the life out of its prey.

   On this steamy afternoon in early August, Takeshi, who studies how
   changes in soil relate to climate science, and his collaborators,
   Harvard Professor [43]Scot Martin and Martin's Ph.D. student Suzane
   Simões de Sá, don't linger by the river. Instead, they continue their
   twisting trek through the thick forest ringing with the songs of unseen
   insects and birds, until they reach their incongruous goal, a 177-foot
   aluminum tower.

   The tower is used in climate research, and resembles a number of such
   structures that will soon be part of a massive, coordinated campaign to
   track something that, over decades, could prove more deadly than the
   Amazon's anacondas, something that floats invisibly, high above the
   pristine jungle: air pollution.

   The research project is called [44]GreenOceanAmazon2014 (GoAmazon2014),
   a collaboration among the[45] U.S. Department of Energy and several
   Brazilian and other international partners. The program, for which
   Takeshi is project manager, studies the environmental impact of a
   growing pollution plume generated in Manaus, Brazil, a burgeoning
   industrial center carved from the dense forest.

A busy city near an unbroken forest

   Researchers hope to ascertain how the city's smog is affecting some of
   the cleanest air in the world, changing cloud formation and rainfall in
   the region, and influencing global climate change. For scientists, the
   busy city encircled by miles of unbroken forest is a perfect natural
   laboratory, a kind of controlled experiment.

   "Manaus is a great test bed. It's an isolated urban region with 2,000
   kilometers of forest around it," said Martin, Harvard's Gordon McKay
   Professor of Environmental Chemistry, the principal investigator for
   the project. In "most places, there are so many possible pollution
   sources, it's very difficult to dissect and interpret the data. Here,
   it's a much more straightforward experiment, given there's only one
   major pollution source."

   On the hike to the tower, Martin pauses occasionally to wipe steam from
   his wire-rimmed glasses. In his checked shirt, khaki shorts, black
   sneakers, and bright yellow Brazilian national soccer team cap, he
   looks less like a jungle explorer than a casual tourist who took a
   wrong turn in the woods. But he is as comfortable and confident in this
   rugged environment as any whip-wielding Indiana Jones.

   Climbing the tower as it sways with the wind is not for the faint of
   heart. Slim aluminum scaffolding connects a series of equally thin
   platforms and ladders. For the first-time climber, the ground
   disappears at an alarming rate during the ascent as the green leaves of
   hundreds of species of trees quickly swallow the brown forest floor.
   Higher up, the incessant buzz of the jungle is replaced by a calm
   silence, the heat eased by a steady breeze. At the top, above the tree
   canopy, the view is of a "green ocean," an endless expanse of emerald
   in every direction.

   Professor Scot Martin is studying how pollution affects rainfall and
   climate change in the Amazon basin near Manaus, Brazil, as part of an
   international campaign coordinated with the U.S. Department of Energy
   called GoAmazon 2014.
