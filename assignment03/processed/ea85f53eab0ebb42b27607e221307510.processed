White House ramps up 9/11 security measures, citing Benghazi

   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday said it had ordered
   heightened security of U.S. facilities abroad on the September 11
   anniversary, citing the attack that killed four U.S. government
   employees in Benghazi, Libya, last year.

   "The president's national security team is taking measures to prevent
   9/11 related attacks and to ensure the protection of U.S. persons and
   facilities abroad," the White House said in a statement.

   President Barack Obama's counterterrorism aide Lisa Monaco has been in
   charge of reviewing security measures in place for the anniversary, the
   White House said.

   Four Americans including the U.S. ambassador to Libya were killed in an
   attack on a compound in Benghazi a year ago. The administration
   initially said the assault grew out of anti-Western protests.

   Later, however, it turned out that Islamist extremists launched the
   attack on the September 11 anniversary. The administration was forced
   for months to defend its handling of the events at Benghazi, with
   critics charging officials deliberately played down the nature of the
   attack to protect the president's re-election bid.

   The White House said its first reports were based on incomplete
   information.

   "The events of last year, losing four brave Americans - Chris Stevens,
   Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods - brought home the reality of
   the challenges we face in the world," the White House said.
