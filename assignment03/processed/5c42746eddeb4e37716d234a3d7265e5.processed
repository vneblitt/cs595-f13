The Two Sides of Tax Lien Sales

   Posted by [86]Aaron Wiener on Sep. 9, 2013 at 11:20 am

   lien In June, I [87]profiled a house that's seen better days. The
   property, on Manor Place NW in Park View, has been boarded up for as
   long as anyone can remember. The city is unable to locate its owner,
   who appears to have died in 1988. He's listed on various documents
   as Irby L. Dickinson, Irby Dickenson, Irby Dickson, and Irby Dickerson.

   The neighbors would love to see the house purchased by a new owner and
   restored so it stops dragging down the mostly attractive block of
   rowhouses. The problem is how to get someone to buy it. The "principal
   collection mechanism authorized by District law" to return abandoned
   properties to productive use, according to David Umansky, spokesman for
   the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, is a tax lien sale, at which
   an investor can buy the property's tax debt in hopes of later obtaining
   the property outright. But in the case of the Manor Place house, the
   tax owed, including penalties, is $358,274, while the house's assessed
   value is only $243,480. In other words, no rational person would pick
   up the tab.

   (There are two other systems by which the city can unload its tax bill
   and get these properties up and running. One of them, a so-called junk
   sale, hasn't been used in more than two years, so as not to discourage
   participation at tax sales. The other, a repurchase program through the
   Department of Housing and Community Development, likewise hasn't
   resulted in any acquisitions this year, as DHCD works on clearing out
   its property backlog.)

   So when the tax debt gets too high, the tax lien sale system breaks
   down. Unfortunately, it can also break down when the debt is piddlingly
   low.

   Mayor Vince Gray just [88]called for a moratorium on tax lien sales in
   the District, in response to a Washington Post [89]investigation that
   found that a small group of investors has foreclosed on dozens of
   homeowners with debts under $1,000. The investors buy the tax lien from
   the city, tack on interest and fees, and then seize the homes if the
   residents can't pay.

   To recap: When tax liens are too high, these sales don't work. When
   they're too low, they often result in a loss of property completely out
   of proportion to the actual debt.

   Presumably, somewhere in the middle, they've at least occasionally
   functioned as intended. But it's pretty clear that these tax lien
   sales, as they currently exist, are often ineffectual, and sometimes
   downright harmful. Some sort of change is needed to inject both more
   flexibility and more fairness into the system.

       The real injustice is the fact that tax lien holders who sell the
       foreclosed properties are not required to refund any remaining
       equity from the sale to the previous homeowner. They basically get
       to steal a house minus the taxes owed to the District. A more
       reasonable system would permit lien holders to obtain a reasonable
       profit and costs from a foreclosure, but be required to return any
       remainder to the owner. No one should be able to steal tens of
       thousands in equity to pay off a 1000 tax lien.

       People should simply pay their taxes.
       Further 200 homes have foreclosed in 8 years. During that time many
       thousands of homes have gone on the market. The post cherry picked
       the worst instances.
       The only bad thing about this program are attorneys fees. Cap them
       at 1 or 2k.
       There is no incentive for someone to pay anothers debt if there is
       not an off chance of foreclosure. Every state in the country has
       tax liens and attached foreclosures.
       Again manage attorneys fees, make concessions for the elderly and
       handicapped in a primary residence read: not owners of vacant or
       blighted properties, and don't throw out the baby with the bath
       water

       People should pay their taxes, yes. However the system is screwy. I
       do sympathize with the families of the elderly who who need
       conservators, but these tax sales can also deal with several
       problem properties that have been essentially abandoned.
       Yes, the city needs to do something about properties they have
       liens on that are several times more than the value. Neighbors
       don't want a tiny bit of Detroit next door. One year of not paying
       and losing one's home is tragic for the household, several years of
       failing to pay (ex. vacant properties) and the property isn't
       foreclosed on is tragic for the community.

       The system is BROKE: Where a 95 yr old lady with Alzheimers has a
       $44 tax bill and her tax lien is sold. Then her house is foreclosed
       on and is sold for $300,000 and the lien holder keeps all of her
       equity. OUTRAGEOUS!!!
       If not true, then OTR should state otherwise.
       At this point, folks need to be FIRED and held liable!!!
       THIS IS THE MOST SHAMEFUL SITUATION THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD ABOUT OR
       SEEN FROM THE DC GOVERNMENT!!!
