About This Miley Cyrus Business ...

   So people have been hitting us up on Twitter and asking us to weigh in
   on the disasterpiece [26]that was Miley Cyrus' performance at Sunday's
   MTV Video Music Awards. Perhaps you've heard someone mention it? There
   was twerking and teddy bears and boatloads of, uh, racial tone
   deafness.

   Part of our silence was due to the Code Switch team's pronounced,
   collective feeling of [27]fremdscham ‚ what was she doing and will we
   ever be able to unsee what she did? ‚ but another part of it was due to
   the abundance of smart, frank takes on the racial semiotics of Cyrus'
   performance that were already out there.
   We wanted to point you to a few of them. (Just a heads up: Some of them
   get pretty explicit, like this next one.)

   Tressie McMillian Cottom, a sociologist (and [28]a fantastic tweeter),
   wrote about the type of women Cyrus chose to accompany her onstage at
   the VMAs and how those women's bodies ‚ women with shapes like Cotton's
   ‚ [29]were meant to be seen as fun house curiosities.

   "I immediately thought of a summer I spent at UNC Chapel Hill. My
   partner at the time fancied himself a revolutionary born too late for
   all the good protests. At a Franklin Street pub one night we were the
   only black couple at a happy hour. It is one of those college places
   where concoctions of the bar's finest bottom shelf liquor is served in
   huge fishbowls for pennies on the alcohol proof dollar. I saw a few
   white couples imbibing and beginning some version of bodily grooving to
   the DJ. I told my partner that one of them would be offering me free
   liquor and trying to feel my breasts within the hour.

   "He balked, thinking I was joking.

   "I then explained to him my long, storied, documented history of being
   accosted by drunk white men and women in atmospheres just like these.
   Women asking to feel my breasts in the ladies' restroom. Men asking me
   for a threesome as his drunk girlfriend or wife looks on smiling. Frat
   boys offering me cash to 'motorboat' my cleavage. Country boys in
   cowboy hats attempting to impress his buddies by grinding on my ass to
   an Outkast music set. It's almost legend among my friends who have
   witnessed it countless times.

   "My partner could not believe it until not 30 minutes later, with half
   the fishbowl gone, the white woman bumps and grinds up to our table and
   laughing tells me that her boyfriend would love to see us dance. 'C'mon
   girl! I know you can daaaaannnce,' she said. To sweeten the pot they
   bought our table our own fishbowl."

   The blogger [30]BattyMamzelle wrote a post which was also posted on
   Jezebel that has garnered a ton of attention. Along the lines of our
   continuing roundtable on race, feminism and digital spaces, she
   wondered why so many feminists who were defending Cyrus from
   slut-shaming [31]were missing all the hard-to-miss racial imagery the
   pop star was playing with.

   "See the problem isn't that they talked about slut shaming. That
   deserves attention. The problem is that they completely sidestepped the
   [32]other glaring teddy bear in the room, and that is the
   commodification of black female sexuality in Miley's performance. But
   it's not a thing that white women deal with, so it didn't warrant
   inclusion or discussion by the white-led mainstream feminist media. ...

   "Now some people have said that Miley is only 20, and she's 'just a
   child' and that she doesn't understand what she's doing. But Miley
   isn't new to this. Her [33]video for the single wasn't even the first
   precursor to this madness. She has been quoted as saying that she
   explicitly wanted '[34]a black sound' for her new album. She is more
   than aware of what she's doing, and has consciously made the choice to
   dabble in traditionally black aesthetics and sound in order to
   breakaway from her good girl image and further her career."

   And Jody Rosen, the music critic at Vulture, [35]argued that Cyrus' VMA
   shtick ‚ wrapping herself in the aesthetic trappings of some form of
   black music ‚ is an old tradition among pop musicians trying to recast
   themselves.

   "A doctoral dissertation could (and will) be written on the racial,
   class, and gender dynamics of Cyrus's shtick. I'll make just one
   historical note. For white performers, minstrelsy has always been a
   means to an end: a shortcut to self-actualization. The archetypal
   example is in The Jazz Singer (1927), in which Al Jolson's immigrant
   striver [36]puts on the blackface mask to cast off his immigrant Jewish
   patrimony and remake himself as an all-American pop star.

   "Cyrus's twerk act gives minstrelsy a postmodern careerist spin. Cyrus
   is annexing working-class black '[37]ratchet' culture, the potent
   sexual symbolism of black female bodies, to the cause of her
   reinvention: her transformation from squeaky-clean Disney-pop poster
   girl to grown-up hipster-provocateur. (Want to wipe away the
   sickly-sweet scent of the Magic Kingdom? Go slumming in a black strip
   club.) Cyrus may indeed feel a cosmic connection to Lil' Kim and the
   music of 'the hood.' But the reason that these affinities are coming
   out now, at the VMAs and elsewhere, is because it's good for business."

   At The New York Times, [38]Jon Caramanica panned out to this year's
   VMAs more broadly and found a celebration of white folks playing in
   black styles.

   "[T]his was a banner year for clumsy white appropriation of black
   culture ‚ the shambolic, trickster-esque performance by Ms. Cyrus, to
   whom no one has apparently said 'no' for the last six months or so,
   which included plenty of lewdness and a molesting of Robin Thicke; the
   ubiquity of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, the edgeless and intensely popular
   hip-hop duo, who received three awards, including best hip-hop video.
   They also performed 'Same Love,' their gay-rights anthem, with the
   singer Mary Lambert, though when Jennifer Hudson emerged to perform the
   last part of the song with Ms. Lambert, it felt like an apologetic
   compensation for the night's whitewash. (For good measure, Eminem
   announced the details of his new album in ads sponsored by Beats by
   Dre.)"

   So there you have it: a good roundup of insightful, challenging takes
   on this Miley Cyrus business that are worth your time. And bonus ‚
   those folks spared us from having to watch the video again to dissect
   it.

   UPDATE: Tressie McMillian Cottom's name was misspelled in an earlier
   version of this post.
