   Live webcast and social media participation
   Background

   As a part of the UNFCCC extended work programme on long-term finance
   mandated by COP 18, the Long-term Finance Work Programme Wrap-up Event
   was held from 10 to 12 September in Incheon, Republic of Korea. This
   event will bring together over 100 representatives from Parties,
   financial institutions, private sector executives, civil society and
   academia. The discussions has been informed by outputs generated from a
   series of activities undertaken in the context of the extended work
   programme on long-term finance, including two meetings of experts.
   Webcast and social media participation
   Virtual participants were provided with opportunities to follow parts
   of the Wrap-up Event via live webcast and put questions, comments and
   information in relation to the on-going discussions via Twitter and
   Facebook. The questions and comments were noted and answered by the
   moderators at the end of the respective webcast sessions.

   Plenary session I: Pathways for mobilizing scaled-up climate finance
   This session will take a look at key features and elements that
   underpin likely pathways for mobilizing scaled-up climate finance to
   USD 100 billion per year by 2020 from multiple sources based on the
   insight that emerged from the two meetings of experts.
     * Barriers to longer-term planning for budgetary resources and
       country experiences and practices adopted to overcome them;
     * Identifying the pathways for public, private and alternative
       sources at aggregate level for the period leading to 2020;
     * Ways and means to achieve greater transparency, including through
       enhanced clarity on the sets of definitions of climate finance

   Plenary session II: Enabling environments and policy frameworks for
   effective deployment of climate finance
   This session will examine and identify conditions and factors that
   determine effective deployment of climate finance in developing
   countries based on insight that emerged from the two meetings of
   experts on long-term finance. The presentations and discussions will
   focus on:
     * Factors that underpin effective deployment of climate finance at
       country and programme/project levels, including emerging approaches
       for measuring effectiveness of deployed climate finance;
     * Efforts to enhance absorptive capacity in developing countries;
     * Transparency of climate finance information

   This session will identify supportive public policies, regulatory
   measures and financial instruments that facilitate scaled up
   mobilization of climate finance from multiple sources based on insight
   that emerged from the work undertaken in 2012 and the two meetings of
   experts on long-term finance.
     * Enabling environments and conducive policies required to unlock
       climate finance from international and domestic sources, public and
       private, multilateral and bilateral, to support low-carbon and
       climate-resilient activities in developing countries;
     * Specific policy measures required to bring down barriers to private
       sector finance and investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient
       programmes and projects in developing countries;
     * The roles of public and private finance actors and development
       finance institutions in achieving scaled-up climate finance.
