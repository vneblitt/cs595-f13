First house in Oak Lane Phase IV opens as Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter

   Four fraternity brothers on the porch of the new house. The new Sig Ep
   house is home to 35 members of the Virginia Tech chapter.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., April 5, 2013 - As students returned to Blacksburg
   earlier this semester, the Virginia Tech [160]Oak Lane community marked
   the opening of the first house in its Phase IV building project.

   The community, which features on-campus fraternity and sorority
   housing, added the new [161]Sigma Phi Epsilon house to the existing 18
   houses on Oak Lane built during Phases I, II, and III.

   "The design is very intentional and allows for a lot of space for
   interaction," said Kenneth Belcher, senior associate director for
   housing services. The new house is home to 35 brothers from the Sigma
   Phi Epsilon chapter and features several study lounges, a conference
   room, a comfortable living room with a Hokie stone fireplace, and a
   large kitchen and dining area for shared meals.

   Heather Evans, director of [162]fraternity and sorority life, said
   these common spaces are a gateway to student involvement.

   "Virginia Tech has great living and learning environments, and I think
   this house speaks to our efforts to establish residential spaces where
   learning complements what goes on in the classroom," said Evans.

   The new house is designed as a [163]residential learning community,
   based on the philosophy that time spent with faculty outside of the
   traditional classroom makes a significant difference in the lives of
   college students.

   Chris Fiori, director of professional and academic outreach in the
   Myers-Lawson School of Construction, a joint venture of the College of
   Engineering and the College of Architecture and Urban Studies, and
   Katie Steuer, career advisor at Smith Career Center, are faculty
   fellows for the house. They serve as mentors and advisors to brothers
   in the chapter. Fiori and Steuer offer sessions and office hours in the
   house, with a focus on the importance of academics, leadership, and
   career preparation.

   The house also provides live-in space for Chad Mandala, a residential
   learning coordinator with the offices of fraternity and sorority life
   and housing and residence life, and resident scholar Nick Warrington of
   Wellston, Ohio, a graduate student studying higher education
   administration in the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences.
   Mandala and Warrington work with the faculty fellows to provide various
   programs to the chapter that range from how to work better as a team to
   how to dress for interviews and prepare for career fairs.

   "I view myself as a brother of Sigma Phi Epsilon who is there to help
   the chapter succeed academically," said Warrington who also works with
   the brothers one-on-one on such topics as time management,
   test anxiety, study habits, organization, and priorities.

   Phase IV marks the beginning of a new funding and construction
   partnership between the fraternity and sorority community and the
   university. Virginia Tech's Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter raised part of
   the project cost for the house, mainly through alumni donations to the
   [164]Virginia Tech Foundation. The university committed to the
   remaining cost. The university owns the new facility, but the joint
   funding model allowed the fraternity to help design the customized
   house to meet its organizational needs.

   Virginia Tech opened Phase I, three houses of 36 beds each, in the fall
   of 1983. Phase II followed with seven houses of 36 beds each in the
   fall of 1990. Phase III opened during the fall of 2001 with eight
   houses of 32 beds in each.

   Phase IV is a continuation of Oak Lane's original purpose - to
   strengthen Virginia Tech's fraternity and sorority community.

   "The fraternity and sorority community embarked upon a strategic
   planning process, and our vision, as well as strategic goal areas, were
   announced last spring," said Evans. "The vision for the fraternity and
   sorority community is to inspire lifetime engagement in the spirit of
   Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), and it is our hope that members of the
   fraternity and sorority community will remain active with their
   interfraternal membership through a myriad of opportunities throughout
   their entire lifetimes."

   The [165]Division of Student Affairs at Virginia Tech encompasses
   departments dedicated to providing a rich co-curricular experience and
   essential student services. Virtually every aspect of a student's life
   outside the classroom is represented through the division's
   departments.

   College of Science.

       Fraternity announce housing construction plan

Fueled by philanthropy

   More than 300 people donated toward construction of the Sigma Phi
   Epsilon house, including several who shared why the project, and the
   fraternal organization, were important to them.

   "This project was a perfect example of a joint effort between Virginia
   Tech and the Greek community that resulted in a unique solution that
   has been admired by universities across the country. We will give young
   men the best academic, social, and fraternity experience available
   anywhere. They will be our future leaders," - John R. Lawson II

   "Membership in Sigma Phi Epsilon helps young men develop leadership
   abilities and character, critical skills for doing well both in and out
   of the workplace. This new facility will also enhance their abilities
   to effectively deal with others in daily lifestyle issues that will
   also serve them well when they enter the world of work," - Samuel L.
   Lionberger Jr.

   "Our house on Clay Street served its purpose very well for over 40
   years. However, with the development of many new neighborhoods on the
   nearby farms, it became clear that there needed to be a better
   long-term solution for our fraternity and the community. The
   public-private venture with the university on this magnificent site on
   the golf course is the perfect location for our long-term housing
   needs." - Donald J. McNamara
