Claire Danes talks Emmys and 'Homeland': 'Saul has amazing stuff this season'

   Claire Danes is deep in the trenches of Homeland filming, with three
   more episodes of season 3 to shoot, and while it's not clear exactly
   what Carrie and Co. at the CIA are up to this year, it's safe to say
   it's going to be intense.

   and Carrie's 'bleak' start
   [45][homeland-trailer_100x100.jpg] 'Homeland' season 3 trailer:
   Everyone is sad -- VIDEO

   In addition, Danes is currently prepping for the Emmy Awards, where
   she's up for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama (she won last year).
   But she still found time to shoot an Emmy-themed ad for Audi, which
   will premiere during the telecast (the exclusive photo above is from
   the ad shoot -- puppies!). "Itâs really kind of goofy and playful,"
   Danes told EW about the Audi ad. "Iâve been doing Homeland for three
   years now and itâs pretty intense," she laughed. "The stakes are
   preposterously, ridiculously high. So I was looking forward to just
   goofing off for a few days and having some fun."

   And fun is not really a word anyone would use to describe Carrie
   Mathison -- regardless of what the future holds. Danes may be close to
   the end of season 3, but that doesn't mean she has any clue where her
   storyline is headed next. "I donât even bother to fantasize about what
   itâs going to be or cultivate a hope for what Carrie might be in the
   coming season because I know Iâm going to be so overwhelmed by [the
   writers'] infinitely better ideas [laughs]."

   While Danes might not yet have a season 4 plan, EW did get her to tease
   some season 3 intel (bad for a CIA agent, great for TV viewers!) about
   the latest in Carrie and Brody's relationship, why Saul and Carrie may
   be on the outs, and the moment she's most proud of from season 2 of
   Showtime's drama.
   ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: There are reports Brody (Damian Lewis) wonât be
   in the first episode or two. Can you tease a little about whatâs going
   on with Brody and Carrie this season?
   CLAIRE DANES: In the beginning of this show, as you would imagine, they
   are physically separated. Heâs on the run and Carrieâs been tracking
   his course but isnât entirely sure where he is at any given moment.
   She, along with the other people in the CIA, is held on trial. The
   organization is under serious investigation and is on the verge of
   maybe ceasing to exist; very vulnerable to being shut down entirely. So
   she and Saul are having to defend it and keep it alive, which is very
   stressful. And [Saul and Carrie] arenât as simpatico as they have been
   in the past. ... Saul has amazing stuff this season, and up until this
   point, he's only been presented as utterly sympathetic and kind, and we
   see a much more complex portrait of him here. Thatâs great, because
   heâs such a rich character.

   Carrie is going to be struggling with all that happened at the end of
   last season, and producers have announced she'll [46]go off her meds.
   What kind of prep work do you do for the bipolar stuff when that side
   of Carrie comes out?
   Last season, she was pretty stable, so I did have to brush up on my
   bipolar homework. So I read some more books this year. I found that the
   most valuable resource is YouTube videos. There are a lot of blogs kept
   by people with the condition and they are often talking directly to the
   camera in hypomanicÂ  states -- observing them is really, really
   helpful. So I kind of binge on those YouTube videos before I go to work
   and kind of reacquaint myself with that state of being, and Iâm very
   moved by what that is like, the struggle they have to go [through]. But
   itâs fun. I like that kind of work. ... Itâs not very often we [as
   actors] get to play such extreme states of being. So I get to go really
   far [and] itâs all justified. [Laughs]

   The show has been a hit since it premiered, but it really took off last
   season with SNL parodies and fans' by-the-minute tweeting. Does any of
   that public reaction inform your performance or is that totally
   separate for you?
   Itâs totally separate, it has to be. Iâm really excited to share what
   weâve been up to with audiences -- we just had the premiere last night.
   It was really fun to unveil it. That enthusiasm is hugely rewarding and
   thrilling -- but it is independent of what goes into making the thing.
   It has to be.

   You mentioned the premiere. I read online that you guys met with some
   CIA agents?
   Yeah, we went toÂ Langley earlier that day. We had a field trip. ... It
   was great. My roommate from college actually works at the CIA, so she
   was able to actually pop down from her office and join us. It was just
   wild to find ourselves in that context [Laughs], just flashing back to
   who we were as freshmen. No way would we have anticipated we would find
   ourselves in that moment. So that was neat to share with her.

   Letâs talk about season 2. Can you highlight the episode youâre most
   proud of?
   I really do think the âQ&Aâ episode is great because itâs such unusual
   television. It was so brave of the creators to have one scene play out
   for as long as it did. It was like a one-act play. It was just really
   unconventional and interesting. ... [Damian and I] tackled it like we
   do every other episode. You donât have time to do too much prep work;
   you got to just lay it down, which I appreciate actually. It makes it
   fun.

   I know you said the writers have better ideas that you could ever come
   up with for Carrie. But do you have any kind of endgame in your head
   how youâd like Carrieâs story to conclude?
   Iâd like for things not to be so impossibly difficult for her!Â  That
   would be nice, if she was afforded a little bit of a break and grace.
   Sheâs earned it. I donât want her to be so lonely, ultimately. But the
   showâs going to have to be over [laughs]. Or her involvement with the
   show is going to have to be over to get to that point. Because thatâs
   not what we want to watch, her being balanced and healthy and regular.
   We donât want her to be regular.

   Homeland`s third season premieres Sept. 29.
