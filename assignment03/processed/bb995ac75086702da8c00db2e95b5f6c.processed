Study shows limiting contact in practice cuts exposure to head hits and
injuries

   BLACKSBURG, Va., Aug. 8, 2013 - Less contact during practice could mean
   a lot less exposure to head injuries for young football players,
   according to researchers at Virginia Tech and [160]Wake Forest Baptist
   Medical Center.

   Their study of 50 youth-league players ages 9 to 12 - the largest ever
   conducted to measure the effects of head impacts in youth football -
   found that contact in practice, not games, was the most significant
   variable when the number and force of head hits incurred over the
   course of a season were measured. [161]Numerous studies in this area
   have been done on high school and college players, but those findings
   do not necessarily apply to younger players.

   Though more than 70 percent of the football players in the United
   States are under age 14, there is no clear, scientifically based
   understanding of the effect of repeated blows to the head in young
   players, said [162]Steven Rowson, assistant professor at the
   [163]Virginia Tech-Wake Forest University School of Biomedical
   Engineering and Sciences and lead author of the study, which has been
   published in the current online edition of the [164]Annals of
   Biomedical Engineering and Sciences.

   To quantify youth football players' exposure to head impacts in
   practices and games during the course of a single season, the
   researchers employed sensors in the helmets of 50 players on three
   teams in two different leagues.

   The sensors were installed on an elastic base inside the helmet so that
   they remained in contact with the head throughout the duration of head
   impact, allowing for measurement of head acceleration rather than that
   of the helmet. Data from the sensors were wirelessly transmitted to a
   computer on the sideline and processed to measure both the linear and
   rotational head acceleration caused by each impact. All data were
   analyzed on an individual player basis and then averaged to represent
   the exposure level of a typical 9 to12-year-old football player.

   The most important finding was that substantial differences existed
   among the three teams for both frequency and intensity of the impacts,
   Rowson said. For the entire season, players on team A experienced an
   average of 37 percent to 46 percent fewer impacts than players on teams
   B and C. For example, the average player on team A experienced 158
   impacts during the season, compared to 294 and 251 on the other two
   teams.

   This can be attributed to several factors, but the primary reason was
   that team A had fewer practices during the season than teams B and C,
   the study showed. During games, impact frequency and acceleration
   magnitudes were not significantly different among the teams. (Note:
   [165]B-roll of the study participants is available online.)

   In addition, team A competed in a league that had implemented [166]Pop
   Warner rule changes, including a limit on contact during practice
   sessions. Teams B and C had no such restrictions.

   Although the practice contacts were limited, there were no differences
   in the head acceleration magnitudes measured in the games between all
   three teams. The 95 percent head accelerations ranged from 41 g to 45 g
   -- with "g" meaning times the force of gravity -- for all three teams
   and were not significantly different. These data show that limiting
   contact in practices does not create an adverse effect in games.

   "It is striking that you can cut head impacts for a player in half just
   by modifying practice, and it does not seem to change the game," said
   Dr. Alexander Powers, assistant professor of neurosurgery at Wake
   Forest Baptist and co-author of the study. "This may be very important
   in kids where brains are developing."

   Coaching style also had a major influence on factors such as the types
   of drills used in practice and the plays called in games, which would
   likely contribute to the differences in the head impact exposure that
   players experienced, the authors reported.

   "We hope that the findings will help improve the safety of youth
   football through rule changes to limit contact in practices, coach
   training and equipment design, especially in developing youth-specific
   helmets to better reduce accelerations from head impacts," said Rowson,
   who graduated with master's and doctorate degrees from Virginia Tech
   in, respectively, 2008 and 2011.

   Funding for the study was provided by the Childress Institute for
   Pediatric Trauma, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
   and the Virginia Tech-Wake Forest University School of Biomedical
   Engineering and Sciences.

   Co-authors are: Dr. Joseph Maldjian, and Dr. Christopher Whitlow, both
   professors of radiology, [167]Wake Forest School of Medicine; Dr.
   Christopher Alexander Powers, professor of neurosurgery, Wake Forest
   School of Medicine; [168]Joel Stitzel, [169]Stefan Duma, and Steven
   Rowson, all of the Virginia Tech - Wake Forest University School of
   Biomedical Engineering and Sciences. Three students also co-authored
   the paper: Bryan Cobb of Blacksburg, Va., a master's student in
   biomedical engineering, and Jillian Urban and Elizabeth Davenport, both
   of Winston-Salem, N.C., and studying at Wake Forest Baptist.

   The [170]College of Engineering at Virginia Tech is internationally
   recognized for its excellence in 14 engineering disciplines and
   computer science. The college's 6,000 undergraduates benefit from an
   innovative curriculum that provides a "hands-on, minds-on" approach to
   engineering education, complementing classroom instruction with two
   unique design-and-build facilities and a strong Cooperative Education
   Program. With more than 50 research centers and numerous laboratories,
   the college offers its 2,000 graduate students opportunities in
   advanced fields of study such as biomedical engineering,
   state-of-the-art microelectronics, and nanotechnology. Virginia Tech,
   the most comprehensive university in Virginia, is dedicated to quality,
   innovation, and results to the commonwealth, the nation, and the world.
