'Voice' Finalist Jamar Rogers -- THUMBS UP From Hospital Bed

   9/13/2013 12:20 AM PDT [29]BY TMZ STAFF
   'Voice' Finalist Jamar Rogers
   THUMBS UP
   From Hospital Bed
   Exclusive
   0912-Jamar-Rogers-hospital-tmz Former "The Voice" finalist Jamar
   Rogers is staying positive following his stint in an intensive care
   unit at an L.A. hospital -- sending TMZ a pic in which he's smiling and
   giving a big thumbs up.
   It's a great sign considering Rogers -- who is HIV positive -- was in a
   bad place earlier this month after suffering a nasty lung infection.
   At one point during his hospital stay, doctors determined Rogers was in
   critical condition -- but he's doing better now ... and was recently
   moved out of the ICU.
   Jamar tells us, "They still have me on oxygen but they have lowered it.
   My body is still super weak but my mind is really strong."
   We're told Jamar has lost a bunch of weight over the past few days --
   mainly because he's living on a Jello diet -- but everyone's optimistic
   that he'll be healthy and singing again in no time.
   Get well soon.

   Has anyone noticed how common it is for talent show contestants to
   suddenly develop some sympathy inducing situation? If you are watching
   these shows, you are being duped.

   I hope he gets better soon...in fact I hope he has a miracle
   cure...cause I'm tired of paying for this crap to help fools with HIV,
   smokers with cancer, gangbangers with bullet holes, EBT "baby mamas"
   with 8 kids, 90 year old people sucking us dry on doctors bills just so
   they can stay alive longer and eat cat food and wander around Walmarts
   looking at a trash cans for 4 hours and bothering everyone with their
   life stories. I mean, if you are wasting your life just taking up space
   and dragging others down...then why extend it? Go out in a blaze of
   glory and get out of the way.

   or is there some dirty tattoo artists out there with a dirty gun!

   I got a a chance to meet him at a HIV/AIDS event in Chicago. He was
   super nice and not very "celebrity." I felt like I was talking to an
   old friend from college. I hope he gets well soon.
