   Jonathan Bartlett comes from a small-town-Pennsylvania childhood and
   landed as an adult in vivacious Brooklyn, NY. Along the way, Bartlett
   has come into his own as an illustrator recognized for his ability to
   tell stories, which we also hold near and dear to our hearts at NPR.

   So when it came to selecting artists for the NPR Wall Calendar,
   Bartlett was a natural fit. He said that public radio not only
   educates, but has often "made me think differently, or given me an
   idea. It nurtures free thinking and innovative dreams."

   We're excited that in listening to NPR this artist, who has received
   honors for his art, and calls The New York Times and The Atlantic his
   clients, found inspiration to help tell our story. You can connect with
   this WNYC New York listener yourself, on Twitter at [28]@seejbdraw.

   Every year, we ask artists and illustrators to channel their NPR
   listening (and love) into art for the NPR Wall Calendar, and we're
   sharing these designs with you. The [29]2014 NPR Wall Calendar is
   available for purchase in the [30]NPR Shop at [31]shop.npr.org.
