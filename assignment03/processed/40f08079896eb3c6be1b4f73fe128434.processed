Algorithm seeks meaningful relationships

   [45]Veronica Meade-Kelly, August 2nd, 2013
     * A new algorithm filters out the noise caused by spurious, indirect
       connections among network nodes, making it possible to pick out the
       most meaningful relationships within the network.
       Image by Susanna M. Hamilton, Broad Communications

   Networks are ubiquitous these days: we use the internet to surf through
   a seemingly endless network of linked sites; we rely on social media to
   network with friends and acquaintances across the globe; and we've come
   to look at the human body as an interconnected system of biological
   processes.

   This explosion of connectivity has been both a boon and a challenge for
   network scientists - the brave souls who are attempting to make sense
   of the data being mined from these systems. They are working in the
   biological, social, and information sciences (and beyond), searching
   networks for meaningful connections that might reveal, for instance,
   how genes, proteins, and drugs interact inside the body, or how people
   influence and work with each other.

   In the August issue of Nature Biotechnology, a team led by Broad
   associate member Manolis Kellis [46]introduced a new algorithm that may
   make this work easier for network researchers in a variety of fields.
   The team developed a method called "network deconvolution" that helps
   researchers identify the most direct connections within complex
   networks by filtering out the background noise caused by indirect or
   incidental connections. The algorithm was designed to address a
   persistent challenge in network science: how to distinguish between
   meaningful relationships among interacting variables (or "nodes") in a
   network, and more spurious, potentially misleading connections.

   "In complex systems where you may have tens of thousands of variables,
   you'll see many connections, but some of those connections are the
   result of indirect relationships - they only exist because the
   variables share a common connection with another, separate variable,"
   explains Soheil Feizi, a graduate student in Kellis's lab and first
   author of the paper. "Those indirect connections are not informative
   and they obscure the true network of direct relationships that
   researchers want to observe."

   It's a complication that may be best understood in terms of Kevin
   Bacon, arguably the world's most popular network node. In the complex,
   IMDB-fueled, "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" network, Bacon would be
   directly connected to John Belushi and Ryan Gosling because he worked
   with each of the actors. But, looking objectively at the network, it
   might also appear that Belushi and Gosling are connected because they
   both worked with Bacon. In reality, the two surely never met and
   probably share no direct connection. Network deconvolution filters out
   such meaningless, indirect relationships so that researchers can focus
   on the important and informative connections at the heart of the
   network.

   "Indirect relationships can cause echoes that reverberate infinitely in
   the data," explains Kellis, who is also an associate professor in the
   Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department at MIT. "These
   create feedback within the network, make spurious connections seem
   substantial, and sometimes make direct connections seem
   disproportionately significant."

   The team saw that, by transforming the network matrix, they could use a
   mathematical shortcut to contain the amplifying effects of those
   echoes. From there, they could reverse the process, getting rid of the
   echoes and revealing an underlying network consisting of only the most
   direct, informative relationships.

   Feizi and Kellis liken the process to cleaning up a dozen audio tracks
   from a dozen conversations at a crowded cocktail party. Each
   conversation may spill into the others, but the ability to single out
   the voices makes it possible to strip out the ambient sound so that one
   clear voice can be heard.

   "Network deconvolution is a powerful new operation for matrices and we
   hope it will be widely adopted," Feizi says. "It's intuitive and simple
   to program, and it allows us to essentially eliminate the noise in the
   network."

   For their Nature Biotechnology paper, the scientists applied their
   algorithm to three distinct types of networks. They looked at gene
   regulatory networks to determine which genes interacted with each other
   within a cell. They looked at protein structures to see which amino
   acids from those proteins truly interacted with each other (as opposed
   to being related because they're, for instance, simply folded next to
   each other). The team also examined co-authorship of papers within
   social networks of scientists to distinguish strong collaborations from
   weak ones. In all three cases, the network deconvolution algorithm
   enabled them to identify the meaningful, direct ties in the network
   more effectively than previous methods.

   The success of the method with these three disparate networks suggests
   that the new algorithm can be applied to an even wider range of
   real-world networks, as a fundamental network science tool to study a
   variety of complex systems.

   Kellis says that versatility is something his lab values greatly.
   "Sitting in a computer science department, working on biology, we are
   constantly asking, how can we think of this specific biological problem
   in more general terms? Can we uncover the fundamental principles hiding
   behind the specific problems that we set out to solve and, if we can,
   what are the broader implications across fields?"

   He says that his lab will continue to search for foundational
   computational methods that can be added to the toolkit scientists use
   to analyze networks. As more systems-level information becomes
   available to the researchers investigating such fields as gene
   regulation, social networks, or the interaction between drugs, genes,
   and disease, there will be a growing need for methods like network
   deconvolution that bring order to the complex worlds within and around
   us.
