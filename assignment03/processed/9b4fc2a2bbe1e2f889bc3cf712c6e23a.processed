Virginia Tech receives multi-million dollar award to accelerate research
using supercomputers

   Wu Feng Wu Feng

   BLACKSBURG, Va., Feb. 12, 2013 - More than a year ago, Virginia Tech
   announced the creation of HokieSpeed, a supercomputer so energy
   efficient that it was the highest-ranked commodity supercomputer in the
   U.S. on the [160]Green500 List in 2011.

   The Green500 compiles a ranking of the most energy-efficient
   supercomputers in the world, akin to ranking the most fuel-efficient
   vehicles in the auto industry.

   [161]Wu Feng, associate professor of computer science in the
   [162]College of Engineering at Virginia Tech, designed and built
   [163]HokieSpeed, with a National Science Foundation instrumentation
   grant for a modest $1.4 million in the supercomputing financial world.
   By contrast, Feng's price tag represented only one-tenth of a percent
   of the cost of the 2011 Top500's No. 1 supercomputer, the K Computer
   from Japan.

   Feng believes he and his team can do even better. So does the Air
   Force's Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR).

   The AFOSR has awarded Feng, formerly of Los Alamos National Laboratory
   where he designed Green Destiny, a highly energy-efficient, 240-node
   supercomputer that consumed 3.2 kilowatts of power (equivalent to two
   hairdryers) and occupied five square feet in 2004 -- a core award of
   $3.5 million over the first three years of the contract with the option
   for a two-year extension at another $2.5 million, or a total of $6
   million over five years to pursue a large-scale interdisciplinary
   effort.

   The goal of the Air Force contract is to achieve a substantial increase
   in the simulation speed of computational fluid dynamics of its micro
   air vehicles (MAVs), a class of unmanned aerial vehicles, using
   accelerator-based supercomputers like HokieSpeed.

   To achieve this target, Feng said his objective is to herald a new age
   in multi- and many-core parallel computing that he believes will
   "transform supercomputing."

   The key to Feng's approach is to couple innovative advances in
   algorithms and mathematics with engineering progress in the co-design
   of hardware and software in supercomputing.

   He has pulled together an internationally recognized team of
   researchers from Virginia Tech and North Carolina State University into
   the effort. They represent aerospace and mechanical engineers, in
   addition to his home department of computer science, as well as
   mathematicians.

   From Virginia Tech, the engineering members of the interdisciplinary
   team include: [164]Christopher Roy, associate professor of aerospace
   and ocean engineering; [165]Adrian Sandu, professor of computer
   science; and [166]Danesh Tafti, professor of mechanical engineering.
   [167]Eric de Sturler, professor of mathematics in the [168]College of
   Science at Virginia Tech, is also a member of the team.

   From North Carolina State University, Hong Luo and Jack Edwards, both
   of mechanical and aerospace engineering, and Frank Mueller of computer
   science, will also be working on this research project.

   In computing, Moore's Law observes that the number of transistors on
   integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years. This
   prediction made in 1965 by Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore, has proved
   accurate for almost half a century and guides long-term planning in the
   semiconductor industry and has correlated to substantial performance
   gains every two years as well.

   "But much of the realizable performance remains untapped" as many
   domain scientists and engineers are still learning how to "fully
   exploit parallel hardware and co-design software for performance
   gains," Feng explained. "Furthermore, coupling hardware-software
   co-design with advances in algorithmic innovation offers the promise of
   multiplicative speed-ups."

   Feng has already achieved significant speed-up in recent supercomputing
   research, leveraging a co-design approach with hardware, software, and
   algorithms for problems in bioinformatics, biophysics, neuroscience,
   and seismology.

   Feng's new interdisciplinary team plans to develop computational fluid
   dynamic (CFD) codes and a supporting hardware-software ecosystem for
   the simulation of micro air vehicles (MAVs). Based on his earlier work,
   Feng said the Virginia Tech research team should be able to "achieve
   substantial speed-up over current simulations and provide significantly
   better utilization of the underlying and co-designed hardware-software
   of a supercomputer."

   The micro air vehicle (MAV) can be as small as about five inches with
   an aircraft close to insect size expected in the near future. In
   addition to having numerous military applications, these tiny robotic
   instruments are useful in hazardous conditions such as collapsed
   buildings or in nuclear power plants.

   The team's efforts should support the aerodynamic predictions for these
   increasingly tiny vehicles.

   Dedicated to its motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), [169]Virginia
   Tech takes a hands-on, engaging approach to education, preparing
   scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the
   commonwealth's most comprehensive university and its leading research
   institution, Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree
   programs to more than 30,000 students and manages a research portfolio
   of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of
   transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and
   by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and
   across Virginia.
