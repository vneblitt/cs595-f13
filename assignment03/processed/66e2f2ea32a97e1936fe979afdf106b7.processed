Olive Garden woos millennials with smaller portions

     * [126]print

   By Leslie Patton, Bloomberg News Bloomberg

   11:20 p.m. CDT, September 15, 2013

   CHICAGO -- Olive Garden, purveyor of the Never Ending Pasta Bowl, has
   discovered portion control.

   In an effort to attract millennials and boost flagging sales, Darden
   Restaurants Inc.'s Italian restaurant chain is introducing small
   plates, including Parmesan asparagus and grilled-chicken tapas. This
   amounts to a 180 degree turn for a chain that has long sold big
   portions to eaters who like a deal.

   The challenge for Olive Garden will be encouraging diners in their 20s
   and 30s, many of whom shun chain restaurants, to drop by for nibbles
   without alienating loyal customers who convene for regular family
   feasts.

   For millennials, "social occasions generally don't tend to be large
   meals in a traditional sense," said Darren Tristano, executive vice
   president at Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based research firm. "They're
   looking for items they can share, sample, that allow them to graze."

   Small plates may not be "a clean fit" for Olive Garden, given its focus
   on families and boomers, he said.

   Olive Garden created the tapas recipes about six months ago and began
   testing the food earlier this year in cities including Atlanta, Los
   Angeles and Grand Rapids, Mich.

   After offering the dishes for a limited time last month, the chain
   plans to add them to the permanent menu in December. It's also trying
   out more small plate varieties such as garlic hummus, chicken meatballs
   and tortelloni stuffed with cheese, to gauge customer response before
   introducing them nationwide.

   Olive Garden has been struggling in the aftermath of the downturn as
   Americans eat out less. Efforts to lure cash- strapped diners with such
   deals as three-course dinners and $6.95 lunches haven't helped much
   because Brinker International Inc.'s Chili's and Applebee's, owned by
   DineEquity Inc., are also advertising cheap eats.

   As a category, sit-down restaurants are lagging behind fast food and
   fast casual joints. Sales at full-service restaurants will rise 2.9
   percent this year to $208.1 billion, compared with a 4.9 percent gain
   for fast-food eateries, according to National Restaurant Association
   estimates.

   Same-store sales at Olive Garden, which has about 820 locations, have
   declined in five of the last eight quarters. Darden, which also owns
   Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse, recently announced it is
   "significantly" cutting Olive Garden store openings to focus on
   attracting new customers.

   "It's wise to slow down that growth a little bit," said Stephen
   Anderson, an analyst at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York. "They're
   getting very close to that saturation point in the U.S.," which would
   be between 900 and 1,000 stores, he said.

   The company is reworking the recipe for its crispy chickpeas after the
   seasoning and breading didn't resonate with diners in testing. It also
   increased the size of its grilled chicken tapas from one to two skewers
   of meat after customers said the portion was too small to share.

   "If you only have one, people are fighting," said Jay Spenchian,
   executive vice president of marketing.

   The small plates, priced at $4, are "expanding the way people think
   about Olive Garden," he said. "The reaction has been excellent."

   While some customers grab a quick glass of wine and a small plate,
   others eat them as appetizers to a larger meal or to sample something
   they've never tasted before, he said.

   Olive Garden has plenty of competition in the race to win over
   millennials. Applebee's has introduced late-night specials such as
   half-price appetizers and girls' night out to attract younger
   customers. Its Club Bee's locations stay open until 2 a.m. and sell
   sangria and bahama mamas to the party crowd.

   Outback Steakhouse, owned by Bloomin' Brands Inc., recently sold a
   $10.99 steak-tasting option with two or three pieces of beef with
   different sauces including brandy peppercorn and Bearnaise. Cheesecake
   Factory Inc. has small plates including chicken samosas and fried
   zucchini.

   More millennials are dropping by the Olive Garden in Irving, Texas, to
   sample the small plates, Alex Aragon, the restaurant's general manager,
   said in an interview.

   The tapas are "closing the gap between lunch and dinner," said Aragon,
   who noted that it's easier for the younger crowd to text and check
   their phones while munching hand-held bites.
