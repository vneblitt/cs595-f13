   sexually ambiguous brother-in-law of Jason Bateman's character, Michael
   Bluth, in Netflix's new season of Arrested Development.

[30]'Arrested' No More: Hurwitz On Why The Bluths Are Back

   If you're anything like me, you probably spent some quality time with
   your Netflix account earlier this year when, after a seven-year hiatus,
   Arrested Development released an entire new season all at once. The
   whole Bluth family is back, along with much of the clever wordplay,
   subtle jokes that get better on repeat viewings and narration by Ron
   Howard fans have come to expect. This time, though, each family member
   gets their own episode. Mitch Hurwitz, who created the show, came in to
   talk to Fresh Air Host Terry Gross about the favorite dysfunctional
   family.

   The Bluths are a family that always had money, and used it to avoid
   learning a lot of the more practical things in life. And they're not
   always very nice to each other. But Hurwitz explains in spite of all
   these downfalls, there's a hopefulness to their dynamic and underneath
   it all, the family loves and needs one another.

   During the interview, Hurwitz said he likes that Arrested Development
   addresses family dynamics and lore, and says that its the basis for
   many of the running jokes and themes about incest you find through the
   episodes. And speaking of jokes, Hurwitz says that a lot of the best
   ones come when the show's writers paint themselves into a corner, and
   have to find a way out.

   It's difficult to talk about Arrested Development without talking about
   one of its producers and its narrator, Ron Howard. Hurwitz fought for
   him to voice the program because, he says, "I suddenly realized that
   this is the most American trustworthy voice that I could possibly think
   of. You know, this voice, these rhythms have been in our heads for 40
   years."

   As Mitch Hurwitz was on his way out, my boss happened to mention that
   he and his wife are expecting their first child. Hurwitz got a big
   smile on his face and said, "You're gonna love it. It's just great.
   You're really gonna love it." Despite the incompetence and misanthropy
   of one family Hurwitz created, somehow it doesn't surprise me that he
   feels so strongly about the real-life ones.
