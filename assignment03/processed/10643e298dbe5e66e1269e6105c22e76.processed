Historical Texts

   The Federalist (1788), and various other historical documents such as
   Magna Carta (1215), are sometimes credited with having influenced the
   content of the Constitution of the United States or its initial
   Amendments (the Bill or Rights), or, in the case of the Constitution of
   the Confederate States of America, with having been influenced by the
   U.S. Constitution although it radically attempted to change its
   effect.Â

   [73]Articles of Confederation (1781) (external link) (The Avalon
   Project at the Yale Law School: Documents in Law, History and
   Diplomacy)Â

   [74]Century of Lawmaking (Library of Congress, National Digital Law
   Library Program) includes: [75]Journals of the Continental Congress;
   Eliot's [76]The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the
   Adoption ofÂ  the Federal Constitution; and Farrand's [77]The Records
   of the Federal Convention of 1787

   [78]Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention (Library of
   Congress. Rare Book and Special Collections Division, Library of
   Congress)

   [79]Declaration of Independence, including Jefferson's draftÂ  (Library
   of Congress) Provides the text of the Declaration of Independence of
   1776 along with a scanned images of the original document as well as of
   the four pages of a Thomas Jefferson's draft of the document.

   [80]Declaration of Independence in text and images images (National
   Archives and Records Administration) Includes the text and scanned
   images of the original and the initial stone engraving of the documents
   as well as useful commentaries. See also [81]Declaration of
   Independence: Right to Institute New Government (Library of Congress)Â

   [82]Documents of the Confederate States of America (1861) (external
   link)Â  (The Avalon Project at the Yale Law School: Documents in Law,
   History and Diplomacy) Includes the Constitution of Confederate States
   of America, and other Confederate legal documents.

   [83]THOMAS: Federalist Papers via [84]Primary Documents in American
   History: The Federalist Papers (Library of Congress) The Federalist
   (also known as "The Federalist Papers") issued as a series of highly
   influential essays in support of the proposed United States
   Constitution, most of which appeared initially in New York newspapers
   under the pen name "Publius" during 1787 and 1788. The actual authors
   were Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison. See also copies
   via [85]University of Oklahoma Law Center's The Federalist Papers
   (external link) and [86]Yale's Avalon Project (external link)

   [87]Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 (National Archives and
   Records Administration) The immensely influential Virginia Declaration
   of Rights, written by George Mason, was adopted by the colonial
   convention June 12, 1776. The opening of the Declaration of
   Independence (adopted a few weeks) borrowed from this document, and the
   U.S. Bill of Rights was adopted directly from this version of the
   natural rights of man as previously proclaimed in the English Bill of
   Rights of 1689 (see below) and philosophers such as John Locke. See
   also the [88]Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 (external link)
   (Avalon Project)

Influences

   FRANCE: [90]Declaration of the Rights of Man, 1789 (external link) in
   English (The Avalon Project at the Yale Law School: Documents in Law,
   History and Diplomacy) French counterpart to the American "Bill of
   Rights" drafted by Lafayette with the assistance ofÂ  Thomas Jefferson,
   and approved by the National Assembly of France August 26, 1789.Â  See
   also [91]DÃ©claration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen de 1789
   (AssemblÃ©e Nationale) - in French

   ENGLAND: [92]English Bill of Rights of 1689: An Act Declaring the
   Rights and Liberties of the Subject and Settling the Succession of the
   Crown (external link) (The Avalon Project at the Yale Law School:
   Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy) Provided specific inspiration
   for American "Bill of Rights" made into law almost a century later.Â

   ENGLAND: [93]Exhibit: Magna CartaÂ  (National Archives and Records
   Administration) The "Great Charter" version of 1297, which despite its
   original limited application has long been regarded as a foundation for
   the development of English liberties and political rights. Although
   King John of England was pressured into signing the first version, in
   1215, (see below), and he violated its terms almost immediately, later
   kings repeatedly were compelled to confirm the limits Magna Carta set
   on royal powers, and the document proved immensely important hundreds
   of years after it was initially ignored. Portions are even reflected
   closely in the U.S. Bill of Rights. A translation of the text of the
   version of 1297, used to confirm its continuing effect at the
   coronation of Edward I, is offered at this site along with images of
   this original document, and commentaries.Â

   ENGLAND: [94]Magna Carta, 1215 (external link) (The Avalon Project at
   the Yale Law School: Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy)
   Translated from Latin to English of what is believed to be the first
   version (from 1215) of the "Great Charter." Includes glossary.

   GREECE: [95]Athenian Constitution by Aristotle (external link) (The
   Avalon Project at the Yale Law School: Documents in Law, History and
   Diplomacy) in English; Sir Frederic G. Kenyon's translation of
   Aristotle on the political structure (or constitution) of the ancient
   city-state of Athens, which is usually considered a prime inspiration
   for the form of government chosen for the United States.

   IROQUOIS: [96]Iroquois Constitution / The Great Binding Law
   Gayanshagowa (external link) (Indigenous Peoples Literature) The
   English version of the historic Great Binding Law ("Gayanshagowa") of
   the Iroqouis' Five Nations Confederacy, which is as much a social
   document as a legal document.
