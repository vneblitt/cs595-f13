   By Clifford Ward Special to the Tribune

   1:52 p.m. CDT, September 13, 2013

   A Downers Grove man accused of fatally shooting his mother in a church
   parking lot could face a life sentence if found guilty, authorities
   said today.

   Michael Zaky Bassaly entered a not guilty plea on charges that he
   murdered Yvonne Zaky Bassaly, 61, on Aug. 29 as they sat in their car
   at the St. Mark Coptic Christian Church in Burr Ridge.

   A grand jury returned a five-count murder indictment against Bassaly,
   prosecutors said.

   Bassaly's attorney Marc Wolfe had asked DuPage County Judge Daniel
   Guerin to bar cameras at today's hearing, but the judge allowed the
   arraignment to be photographed.

   Wolfe argued that video images could have a negative effect on
   Bassaly's Egyptian relatives, who are Coptic Christians. Followers of
   that faith have faced persecution in Egypt.

   Bassaly, 27, is accused of shooting his mother just days after federal
   authorities began investigating him, authorities said.  Bassaly is
   alleged to have made claims that he was a government employee who could
   help people seeking asylum in the U.S.

   Bassaly, who was born in Egypt, is being held in lieu of bond in the
   DuPage County Jail.
