   10:57 a.m. CDT, September 15, 2013
   Rain is in the forecast but Chicagoland Speedway officials say Sunday's
   NASCAR Chase for the Sprint Cup opening race  is still on.
   "We are still scheduled to race as planned right now," a speedway
   spokesperson said at midmorning.
   Joey Logano holds the pole position for Sunday's Geico 400 and Kyle
   Busch is seeking a three-race sweep in the race, set to go at
   approximately 1 p.m. on Chicagoland's 1.5-mile oval.
   Busch won a the Camping World EnjoyIllinois.com 225 NASCAR trucks run
   on Friday and Saturday's Nationwide Series Dollar General 300.
