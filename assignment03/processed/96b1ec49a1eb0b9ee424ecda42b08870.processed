   By [137]Teddy Greenstein, Chicago Tribune reporter

   8:44 p.m. CDT, September 15, 2013

   It was a day for all-weather gloves, giant umbrellas and fantasy
   football.

   Only six players concluded their final rounds of the BMW Championship
   on Sunday at water-logged Conway Farms, where more than an inch of rain
   fell.

   The final pairing of leader Jim Furyk (13 under) and Steve Stricker (12
   under) did not sniff the first tee. They're among 22 players who did
   not strike a ball Sunday.

   Play will resume at 8 a.m. Monday, with Furyk and Stricker set to go at
   9:40.

   "Good and bad news," Furyk said. "I'm anxious to get out there and
   play. But no one wants to play in this and slop it around."

   Play was suspended at 10 a.m. and resumed at 1:31 p.m. But after 57
   minutes, the players again took shelter.

   "Mother Nature just won't give us a break as far as shutting the faucet
   off," said Slugger White, the PGA Tour's vice president for rules and
   operations.

   This is the 22nd tour event this season that has been suspended for
   reasons such as fog, lightning, hail, sleet, frost, darkness and high
   wind. It will be the third with an unscheduled Monday finish.

   "It's not foreign," said Zach Johnson, who is three shots off the lead.
   "We're accustomed to sitting in a locker room watching football and
   trying to figure out when to warm up, when we should eat and whether
   you need to change your flights. It's just something you roll with."

   There was no movement on the leaderboard Sunday as players also vie to
   earn enough FedEx Cup points to advance to this week's Tour
   Championship. Only the top 30 in the standings qualify.

   The gates will open at 7 a.m. Monday. Anyone with a Sunday ticket or
   weekly badge will be admitted, and tickets can be purchased Monday for
   $55.

   All general spectator parking, including BMW Owners' parking, H lot and
   VIP parking, is being moved to Six Flags Great America in Gurnee.
   Shuttles will be provided from Six Flags Great America to the main
   entrance at Conway Farms.

   The forecast for Lake Forest looks pretty good.

   "Maybe some scattered lake showers in the morning," White said, "but
   better as the day goes on. We may even see some sunshine."
