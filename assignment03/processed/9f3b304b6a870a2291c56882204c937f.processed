American Football Subject of New Library Publication

Library to Preview ‚Football Nation‚ at Sept. 16 Book Talk

   As far back as 1609, colonists in Jamestown, Va., were discussing
   football as played by the Powhatan Indians. More than 400 years later,
   Americans are still engrossed with a sport that is ingrained in the
   national culture.

   "Football Nation: Four Hundred Years of America‚s Game" by Susan
   Reyburn is an unprecedented look at football from its early days in
   colonial America to the professional and college game in the 21st
   century. Published by the Library of Congress in association with
   Abrams Books, this visually appealing social and cultural history
   contains nearly 400 images‚many rare or never before
   published‚including memorabilia, cartoons, fine art and game
   photographs. The lively text examines how the game acquired its
   distinct American style, survived attempts to end it, and became the
   country‚s dominant sport‚thriving despite wartime, social change,
   intensifying fan participation and corporate influence.

   Illustrated features explore the history of the fight song, tailgating,
   and cheerleading; how Hollywood has portrayed the game and its players;
   the role of women in football; and the impact of game-changing
   personalities from pioneer Walter Camp to legendary coach Vince
   Lombardi and contemporary player agents. From Abigail Adams to Al
   Capone, Nathan Hale to Peyton Manning, this book reveals how America
   became a football nation.

   Reyburn is a writer-editor at the Library of Congress and the author of
   "Women Who Dare‚Amelia Earhart" (2006). She is a co-author of "Baseball
   Americana: Treasures from the Library of Congress" (2009), "The Library
   of Congress Civil War Desk Reference" (2002) and "The Library of
   Congress World War II Companion" (2007). She has also written
   extensively for the National Trust for Historic Preservation on
   historic sites and gardens.

   "Football Nation," which is scheduled for publication on Oct. 8, will
   be the subject of a Books & Beyond discussion and book-signing by
   Reyburn and image researcher Athena Angelos at noon on Monday, Sept. 16
   in the Mumford Room, located on the sixth floor of the James Madison
   Building at 101 Independence Ave. S.E, Washington, D.C. The event,
   which is sponsored jointly by the Center for the Book in the Library of
   Congress and the Library‚s Publishing Office, is free and open to the
   public; tickets are not required.

   "Football Nation," a 256-page hardcover book, will be sold for $30 at
   bookstores nationwide and through the Library of Congress Shop, 10
   First St. S.E., Washington, D.C., 20540-4985. Credit-card orders are

   orders will be accepted. Advance copies of the book will be available
   for purchase and signing at the Sept. 16 event.
