Herry Me!

   We have some die-hard fans of Arrested Development here in the Sesame
   Workshop offices, so we're incredibly excited about the show's return
   this weekend.  Our infatuation makes a lot of sense, since Tobias
   shares our love of [31]blue things, Bert and Ernie know all about the
   [32]Banana Stand, and everyone knows that what comes first is
   [33]family (unless you're talking about the things you eat, then it's
   [34]breakfast).

   The connections between both shows don't end there.  Several cast
   members from Arrested Development have ridden the stair car to Sesame
   Street.  The clearest connection is Will Arnett, who plays GOB Bluth,
   when he appeared on Sesame Street as Max the Magician.  He's a natural,
   since GOB is known for his magic tricks (sorry, "illusions").  GOB and
   Max even use similar-sounding theme songs.  They're also not very good
   magicians.  Of course, [35]the Sesame gang figures out Max's illusions
   pretty quickly, which might threaten his membership in the Magicians
   Alliance.

   Jason Bateman, who plays Michael Bluth on Arrested Development, brought
   his signature snark to Sesame Street to help explain the word
   "comfort".  Getting cooperation from a penguin, a squirrel, and Elmo
   isn't nearly as tough as wrangling the members of the Bluth family, but
   the end result is still just as satisfying.

   Ron Howard, who serves as Arrested Development's narrator and Executive
   Producer, and Henry Winkler, who plays the Bluth family lawyer Barry
   Zuckercorn, have been working together since their time on Happy Days
   as Richie Cunningham and the Fonz.  [37]Richie and Fonzie appeared
   together on Sesame Street to teach body parts, on and off (with the
   help of Fonz's trademark jab at the jukebox), and the letter
   "Ayyyyyy!"  He's very good.

   Several recurring actors on Arrested Development have popped up on
   Sesame Street over the years, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who played
   blind District Attorney Maggie Lizer, when she portrayed TV reporter
   Kathie Lee Kathie in the Sesame Street's All-Star 25^th Birthday
   special.  Amy Poehler, who played GOB's nameless wife, taught Elmo the
   word "[38]challenge" in a Word on the Street segment.  Dave Thomas, who
   made for a very threatening British man, played a slightly less
   threatening carnival owner in Sesame Street's first feature film Follow
   That Bird.

   And that's not all!  Arrested Development had their fair share of
   celebrity cameos, like [39]Andy Samberg, Andy Richter, [40]Ben Stiller,
   Richard Belzer, and [41]Martin Short, all of whom have appeared on
   Sesame Street, in Sesame Street specials, and in exclusive videos made
   for the Sesame Street YouTube channel.  The fact that these two shows
   have so many connections is as Ann as the nose on plain's face.

   So as you watch the fourth season of Arrested Development, keep an eye
   out for more Sesame Street connections wherever they're hiding.  They
   could be in a [42]chicken dance, in an [43]ice cream sandwich, or even
   a puppet named [44]Franklin.
