   Cape May Beach Tour in August 28, 2013. (Transcript Below)
   Governor Christie: We know that we want this last week to be as strong
   and as great as it could possibly be for these businesses, for the
   shopkeepers, for the hotels, for the motels, for the rental homes, for
   all the people down here who help to make most of their living during
   these months of the summer. So, the good news is I think except for
   maybe a little bit of rain today we're going to have a great rest of
   the week. Stronger than the Storm baby. She's going to start singing it
   now.
   I know that I have a mission now, much different than a job, and the
   promise I'll leave you with today is that there will not be anyone or
   anything that is going to successfully get in between me and the
   completion of the mission that this storm laid at our feet. I will not
   let the people of this region or this country forget what New Jersey is
   going through, and I will not rest until every one of our 8.8 million
   people have their lives back to normal and can live happily again in
   this state. That's my mission. That's the mission this storm gave me.
   The job you gave me gives me that mission and I am not going to quit,
   and believe me, I won't let anything, whether it's politicians in
   Washington, DC or politicians on the ballot this fall get in between me
   and the completion of this mission, so thank you all for coming today.
   I appreciate it very much.
