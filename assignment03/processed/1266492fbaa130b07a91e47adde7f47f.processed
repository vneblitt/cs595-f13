DMX -- 'I Got a Big Ass D**k' ... and I Like to Show It

   9/15/2013 12:59 PM PDT [29]BY TMZ STAFF
   DMX
   'I Got a Big Ass D**k'
   ... And I Like to Show It
   Exclusive
   [30]091513_dmx_launch DMX has no problem flashing his massive donger in
   public -- telling TMZ his naked streak through a Detroit hotel was his
   way of showing off his pride ... in his penis.
   X was at LAX last night when he explained why in the world he went
   balls (and more) out -- and it wasn't just a dare.
   In case you missed it ... DMX was caught on surveillance footage last
   week flashing his naughty bits to a hotel employee while his friends
   watched on.
   [31]090513_dmx_launch
   The 42-year-old rapper also spends time roasting our camera guy ... and
   it's awesome.

   Jerome pulled out his thing in class one day and said "Teacher don't I
   have the biggest one in the entire class?". The teacher replied "I'm
   sure you do jerome." He said "It's cuz I'm black huh?" She said "No
   jerome it's because you're 17 and in third grade."

   He was such a talented rapper. His voice was unique, his style. I still
   have the " Great Depression " CD. I loved to play it out loud. I hope
   he gets back to music.

   If only having a big vagine packed the same punch! How deeply insecure
   must a man be to feel compelled to share his junk with the world. What
   DMX doesn't quite understand is that a man's character, morals and
   mental state determine how much of a catch you really are rather than
   the size of your man meat. When the number of times you've been to jail
   out weigh your talent, you might just simply suck at life!
