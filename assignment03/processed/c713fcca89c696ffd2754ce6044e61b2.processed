One of a kind: Glassblower's work keeps research moving
     __________________________________________________________________



   Tom Wertalik, scientific glassblower Tom Wertalik, scientific
   glassblower with the Department of Chemistry, maintains a stream of air
   into glass he works to prevent it from collapsing. Special lenses in
   his glasses block the harsh orange glare from the flame and allow him
   to see the glass while it's heating.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., April 12, 2013 - When scientists, engineers, and other
   researchers at Virginia Tech need a glass component for lab work, they
   have two options: if it exists, try to order it, or call Tom Wertalik,
   the university's only scientific glassblower.

   In his Hahn Hall South lab, as a member of the Department of Chemistry,
   Wertalik puts nearly three decades of glass making experience to use
   helping researchers invent the future with the help of one very
   unscientific, primary tool - a flame.

   "What I do is technically called lamp working, or flame working, which
   is a discipline of glass blowing," Wertalik explained. "The kind you
   see with the really long pipe, that isn't what I do."

   And it's a good thing too, because what people think of as traditional
   glass blowing is only useful for basic shapes. Wertalik's work is far
   more complex.

   "People will come in and ask for all kinds of things - many of which
   don't exist," he said. "They'll bring sketches on pieces of paper or
   we'll talk about what they're trying to achieve and usually we can work
   something out but not every idea can be made of glass.

   "This isn't a machine shop," Wertalik explained. "Glass is blown, it's
   formed, it's shaped with hand tools. You can't get down to extreme
   tolerances and there will always be variations. My goal is that if I
   make six of something they should all look similar visually, but they
   won't be exact."

   Those items that can be made from glass, however, like a feeding tube
   for bed-bug research that Wertalik completed for researchers in the
   Department of Entomology in the College of Agriculture and Life
   Sciences, are sometimes refinement efforts of existing products. "They
   brought a couple older versions of some glassware and we made some
   modifications," Wertalik said. "It turned out really well, but
   sometimes it requires a little trial and error like any research. But
   part of the job is interpreting what the customer is looking for and
   sometimes you sit down and draw it out until you come up with the right
   idea."

   The bed-bug feeder is a fairly small, complex piece of glass but some
   of Wertalik's larger works can contain more than 20 separate pieces of
   glass and involve multiple sessions at the torch.

   "It's rare you do a piece that's finished in a single sitting," he
   said. Scientific glass often features multiple glass-in-glass
   formations that can't be done at one time but are completed in a series
   of steps.

   "The benefit of scientific glass like this is that it's relatively
   inert to most chemicals," he said. "It takes heat pretty well and won't
   expand and crack if you put it over a moderate heat source, which is
   important for laboratory glassware."

   In addition to the `regular' scientific glass, Wertalik also works with
   quartz which is even more inert to different chemicals and acids, and
   has an even higher melting temperature. The quartz he uses doesn't heat
   to a flaming orange like most glass. It turns bright white and a solid
   bar of quartz, when heated, will distribute light out the non-heated
   end like a flashlight.

   "This is the basis for fiber-optics," he said. "Quartz isn't used too
   much in chemistry, but it's very popular for electrical engineering
   purposes."

   Although he works in the College of Science, Wertalik does a good deal
   of work for both electrical and chemical engineering as well. "I'll do
   whatever anyone in the university needs," he said. "I've done work for
   the mining program, environmental departments, whoever -- that's what
   I'm here for."

   Wertalik's `being there' attitude and willingness to sit down and work
   with clients from anywhere within the university isn't lost on his
   customers. "We are the envy of many universities, having a master
   glassblower like Tom here," said James Tanko, Department of Chemistry
   chair. "From the standpoint of the fabrication of scientific glassware,
   having Tom here means the practical limitation is our imagination. If
   we can think of it, chances are he can make it."

   The flexibility that Wertalik brings to the university encompasses both
   cost and time - both important components in research science.

   "Stuff that would cost a fortune from an external vendor we can do in
   house for little more than the cost of material," Tanko explained.
   "It's a major asset to move research forward."

   In-house production can also expedite research, especially in the case
   of complex or new glassware. When a researcher brings an idea to
   Wertalik the end product is realized fairly quickly and far less
   expensively. But the payoff compounds if the researcher realizes the
   piece doesn't quite work or if the experiment requires changes to the
   glassware. In those cases, modifications have to be made, and because
   it was designed and built in-house, those modifications save a lot more
   money and time - getting researchers back on track to teach, learn,
   explore, and discover.

   All that science and knowledge realized because of one man, and a
   flame.

   The [160]College of Science at Virginia Tech gives students a
   comprehensive foundation in the scientific method. Outstanding faculty
   members teach courses and conduct research in biological sciences,
   chemistry, economics, geosciences, mathematics, physics, psychology,
   and statistics. The college offers programs in cutting-edge areas
   including, among others, those in energy and the environment,
   developmental science across the lifespan, infectious diseases,
   computational science, nanoscience, and neuroscience. The College of
   Science is dedicated to fostering a research-intensive environment that
   promotes scientific inquiry and outreach.
