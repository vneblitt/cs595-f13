Become a Safer Swimmer

   Swimming, whether at a pool or at the beach is a great way to get some
   exercise and spend time with your family and friends. But swimming can
   be risky for children and inexperienced adults. These resources can
   help you and your children stay safe in the water:

   Keeping Kids and Adults Safe
     * Through the[56] American Red Cross water safety page you can enroll
       your child in a swimming class and learn where to find U.S. coast
       guard approved life jackets
     * [57]CPR  is an important life-saving skill to know during a water
       related emergency
     * Teach your children about the importance of pool safety through
       this interactive video game:[58] "The Adventures of Splish and
       Splash"
     * Make sure to keep a cell phone and first aid kit close by in case
       of an emergency
     * And of course, remember to apply plenty of sunscreen to reduce the
       chance of skin damage

   Staying Safe at the Pool

   If you decide to swim at a pool this summer, remember to make sure that
   all equipment is up to date and that all pool drains are covered.

   If you are visiting a community pool, take the time to read and follow
   the pool rules posted and only swim at pools where there is a lifeguard
   on duty.

   At a residential pool, a fence should be installed around the perimeter
   of the pool and an experienced adult swimmer should always be present.
   Learn more from  PoolSafety.gov's tips on[59] staying safe at community
   and[60] residential pools and spas.

   Staying Safe at the Beach

   It's important to remember that swimming at a beach is drastically
   different than swimming at a pool so you'll need to be extra careful
   in natural bodies of water. The biggest danger of swimming in the ocean
   is getting caught in rip currents, powerful currents on the surface of
   the water that can quickly carry you out to sea.[61] Watch this video
   to learn how to avoid and escape them.

   Remember never to swim at a beach when there isn't a lifeguard present
   and to familiarize yourself with the[62] beach warning flags before you
   and your family decide to go swimming.
