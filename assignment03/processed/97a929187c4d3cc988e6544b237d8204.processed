Learning to Live Together

   In todayâs increasingly diverse societies, UNESCO continues to
   accomplish every day its fundamental humanist mission to support people
   in understanding each other and working together to build lasting
   peace.

   Yet, lasting peace rests on a complex and fragile web of daily
   practices embedded in local settings and the most ephemeral encounters
   that individuals and communities creatively maintain out of the
   conviction that they constitute the sustainable conditions for living
   together in dignity and shared prosperity.

   At a time of increasing global challenges and threats, such as
   inequality, exclusion, violence and sectarianism worsened by local
   tensions and conflicts which undermine humanityâs cohesion, learning to
   live together among all members of the global community becomes more
   topical than ever before.

   Individuals become interculturally competent through learning and life
   experience for successful living in the modern complexity of our
   heterogeneous world and consequently they become prepared to appreciate
   diversity as well as to manage conflicts in accordance with the values
   of pluralism and mutual understanding.

   On a daily basis, from its Headquarters and in the Field, UNESCO
   intervenes to accompany its Member States and all its partners to
   better understand and address the challenges of our more and more
   diversified societies, particularly through its intergovernmental
   Programme for Management of [22]Social Transformations (MOST) as well
   the [23]Culture of Peace and Non-Violence Programme which include,
   inter alia, initiatives for [24]democracy and global citizenship,
   [25]intercultural dialogue, [26]education for peace and human rights
   and [27]peace-building.

   Furthermore, UNESCO seeks to promote the development and the practice
   of [28]sporting activities, as well as the fight against doping to
   foster social integration in different cultural and political contexts,
   recognizing that sport disregards both geographical borders and social
   classes.

   The Organization also works to ensure that [29]health and education are
   not the privilege of those who are well-off.

   "It is not enough to be connected to each other. We also share our
   solutions, our experiences and dreams in one great community supported
   by human rights and fundamental freedoms."
