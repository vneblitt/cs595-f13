The March on Washington detailed in never before seen photos

   WASHINGTON - More than 100 photos, many of them never seen before, are
   now on display at the Library of Congress to commemorate the 50th
   anniversary of the March on Washington.

   The display called "A Day Like No Other" will be up until March 1, 2014
   in the Great Hall of the library's Jefferson Building.

   The exhibit consists of more than 70 photos in a video montage, 40
   black and white photos independently taken by people at the march line
   the walls, and another 16 photos from various news outlets are encased
   in a glass display.

   "They singly depict the crowd in a very aesthetic way, or close-ups of
   people and giving you a real feel for being there," says exhibit
   curator Verna Curtis.

   The exhibit was five years in the making, Curtis says.

   "Knowing that the various commemorative events would be happening we
   started collecting on Civil Rights, and we purchased materials as well
   as we were given gifts from photographers, and also those from whom we
   purchased would give us extra prints," Curtis says.

   The photos displayed via video feature a collection from photographer
   Roosevelt Carter who managed to get close-ups of many celebrities, such
   as James Baldwin, Josephine Baker and Charlton Heston, who attended the
   march.

   "Most of the celebrities who came, came to be part of the march. They
   came to be people, and they wanted to join in with the everyday people
   to support the cause," says curator Maricia Battle, who worked with
   Curtis to create the exhibit.

   She says her favorite photo is of the late actor and activist Ossie
   Davis standing at a podium while holding up a souvenir program in his
   right hand.

   "You see the look on Mr. Davis's face and he's holding up this
   brochure, and you're kind of going, 'He meant business that day',"
   Battle says.

   The exhibit is free to the public, and is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30
   p.m. Monday through Saturday.

   Wednesday, the library will have a one-day display related to the March
   on Washington.

   Among the materials:

     * Two versions of the speech at the march by John Lewis,
       then-chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
       (SNCC): the original prior to editing, and the one he presented.
       Lewis, now a congressman from Georgia, will speak at the exhibit's
       opening ceremony Wednesday.
     * Chief organizer Bayard Rustin's original planning notes for the
       march.
     * March director A. Philip Randolph's letter to President John F.
       Kennedy requesting a meeting "to discuss the program of the march
       and plans for implementation by your administration and Congress."

   Battle hopes the public will not only view the photos for their
   historic nature, but become engaged with the stories they tell.

   "We want people to get that feeling for either remembering because they
   were there themselves, or just saying, 'That's the story my father, or
   my grandfather, talked about'," Battle says.
