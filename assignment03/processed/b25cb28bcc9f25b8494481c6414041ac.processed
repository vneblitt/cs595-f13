New York, 16 September 2013 - Secretary-General's remarks to the Security
Council on the report of the United Nations Missions to Investigate
Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons on the incident that occurred on
21 August 2013 in the Ghouta area of Damascus

   It is with a heavy heart that I submit to the Security Council the
   report of the United Nations Missions to Investigate Allegations of the
   Use of Chemical Weapons on the incident that occurred on 21 August 2013
   in the Ghouta area of Damascus.

   As I join you here, the President of the General Assembly has been
   given a copy of the report so that he can inform the Member States.

   I wish to express my immense gratitude to the Head of the Mission,
   Professor Åke Sellström, and his team of scientists and technical
   experts, for their stellar work.  They performed in battlefield
   conditions, in record time.  Impartial and independent, they represent
   the best of the United Nations and I thank them for their contribution.

   I am also grateful to the Directors-General of the Organization for the
   Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the World Health Organization for
   their indispensable support.

   The Mission has concluded that chemical weapons were used on a
   relatively large scale in the Ghouta area of Damascus in the context of
   the ongoing conflict in Syria. The attack resulted in numerous
   casualties, particularly among civilians.

   The Mission's findings are based on the evidence it obtained in the
   course of its activities in the Ghouta area.  The Mission adhered to
   the most stringent protocols available for such an investigation,
   including to ensure the chain of custody for all samples.

   The planning for the Mission was complex and highly delicate. Routes of
   entry into the relevant areas and other crucial elements remained
   uncertain until the final moments.  The Mission was also the victim of
   a sniper attack.  Despite these difficulties and dangers, the Mission
   was able to carry out extensive activities on site in the limited time
   it had available.

   The team interviewed more than 50 survivors, medical personnel and
   first responders. It applied a rigorous and objective selection process
   designed to identify survivors who may have been exposed to chemical
   agents. It assessed these individuals' symptoms and collected
   biomedical samples, including from hair, urine and blood.

   The Mission also documented and sampled impact sites and munitions, and
   collected 30 soil and environmental samples - far more than any
   previous such United Nations investigation.

   The statements by survivors offer a vivid account of the events of 21
   August.

   Survivors reported that following an attack with shelling, they quickly
   experienced a range of symptoms, including shortness of breath,
   disorientation, eye irritation, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting and
   general weakness.  Many eventually lost consciousness.  First
   responders described seeing a large number of individuals lying on the
   ground, many of them dead or unconscious.

   The Mission also interviewed nine nurses and seven treating physicians,
   several of whom responded immediately to the incident.  They reported
   seeing a large number of people lying in the streets without external
   signs of injury, some with laboured breathing, most of them
   unconscious.

   The weather conditions that morning were conducive to maximizing the
   potential impact of an attack involving heavy gases, which can stay
   close to the ground. Weather information showed a falling temperature
   between 2:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. The downward movement of air would have
   allowed the gas to easily penetrate the basements and lower levels of
   buildings and other structures where many people were seeking shelter.

   Let me turn now to the handling and analysis of the materials that were
   collected by the Mission.

   The samples were sent for analysis to four laboratories designated by
   the OPCW. The Mission's factual findings are as follows.

   (a)The environmental and biomedical samples demonstrate the widespread
   nature of the attacks. Eighty-five per cent of the blood samples tested
   positive for sarin. Biomedical samples were taken from 34 of the 36
   patients selected by the Mission who had signs of poisoning. Almost all
   tested positive for exposure to sarin.

   (b)These results were corroborated by the clinical assessments, which
   documented symptoms and signs consistent with nerve agent exposure. A
   number of affected patients were diagnosed with intoxification by an
   organophosphorous compound, and clearly showed symptoms associated with
   sarin, including loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, blurred
   vision, eye inflammation, vomiting and seizures.

   (c)A majority of the environmental samples confirmed the use of sarin.
   The samples were taken from impact sites and surrounding areas -
   locations where survivors were also found to have been affected by
   sarin.

   (d)The team was also able to examine impacted and exploded
   surface-to-surface rockets that are capable of carrying a chemical
   payload. These were carefully measured, photographed and sampled. A
   majority of the rockets or rocket fragments recovered were found to be
   carrying sarin.

   On the basis of its analysis, the Mission concluded that it - and I
   quote - "collected clear and convincing evidence that
   surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used
   in the Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zalmalka in the Ghouta area of
   Damascus."

   Due to the security situation and other limitations, the Mission was
   unable to document the full extent of the use of chemical weapons on 21
   August or to verify the total number of causalities.

   The results are overwhelming and indisputable.  The facts speak for
   themselves.

   I wish to emphasize that the Mission has yet to complete its
   investigation of the other allegations of the use of chemical weapons
   in Syria. The Mission will return to Syria as soon as practical to
   complete its investigation of Khan Al Assal and all other pending
   credible allegations before completing its final report. I will count
   on the continued resolve of team, as well as the support of Member
   States.

   The United Nations Mission has now confirmed, unequivocally and
   objectively, that chemical weapons have been used in Syria.

   This is a war crime and a grave violation of the 1925 Protocol and
   other rules of customary international law.  I trust all can join me in
   condemning this despicable crime. The international community has a
   responsibility to hold the perpetrators accountable and to ensure that
   chemical weapons never re-emerge as an instrument of warfare.

   The accession of Syria to the Chemical Weapons Convention and Syria's
   belated acknowledgement that it possesses chemical weapons are welcome
   developments that come with strict obligations.

   The Russian Federation and the United States, led by Foreign Minister
   Lavrov and Secretary of State Kerry, held intensive consultations in
   Geneva last week, along with their experts. I welcome the understanding
   they reached regarding the safeguarding and destruction of Syria's
   chemical weapons stockpiles.  I hope the Security Council and the
   Executive Council of the OPCW can move quickly to consider and
   implement this plan.  I stand ready to support this plan in every way
   possible, while also fully realizing the complexities of such an
   undertaking in the midst of a civil war.

   The unity of the Security Council will be crucial. Given the gravity of
   the situation, I urge the Council to consider ways to ensure
   enforcement of, and compliance with, the plan through a clear
   resolution.  In that regard, I draw your attention to a significant
   element in the agreement reached in Geneva, and I quote:

   "The United States and the Russian Federation concur that this UN
   Security Council resolution should provide for review on a regular
   basis the implementation in Syria of the decision of the Executive
   Council of the OPCW, and in the event of non-compliance, including
   unauthorized transfer, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in
   Syria, the UN Security Council should impose measures under Chapter VII
   of the UN Charter."

   End quote.  I agree there should be consequences for non-compliance.
   Any use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, is a crime.

   We should not lose sight of the broader perspective of the Syrian
   crisis.  The terrible loss of life on 21 August was the result of one
   of many attacks that have collectively killed more than 100,000 people
   in Syria during the past two and a half years.

   The UN Commission of Inquiry has reported that Government and
   pro-government forces have committed murder, enforced disappearances,
   extrajudicial executions, rape and torture against civilians. It has
   also reported that anti-government armed groups have committed murder,
   executions, torture and hostage-taking. There has been indiscriminate
   shelling of civilian neighbourhoods by all sides. Yet arms continue to
   flow to the country and the region.

   As action on chemical weapons moves ahead, the international community,
   including the United Nations, should also not be blind to the war
   crimes and crimes against humanity being committed with conventional
   weapons.  There must be no impunity for these violations, either.

   The humanitarian situation is desperate. Food supplies are dangerously
   low in some places.  We lack access to many people in need.  People are
   living under siege.  Families face intolerable choices between the risk
   of remaining in place and the risk of taking flight.  Communities that
   once lived in relative harmony are now torn with sectarian tension.
   One third of the country's people have fled their homes -- the largest
   flows of refugees and internally displaced persons in many years,
   causing instability across the region.

   We need to do everything we can to bring the parties to the negotiating
   table. This is the only path to a durable solution. I stand ready to
   convene the International Conference on Syria in Geneva as soon as
   possible.  I look forward to meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov and
   Secretary Kerry on 28 September. I hope we will be able to set a date
   for the conference at that time. I also hope that this Council will
   provide full support to the efforts of Joint Special Representative
   Lakhdar Brahimi to prepare the ground for its launch.

   This is the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against
   civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988.  The
   international community has pledged to prevent any such horror from
   recurring, yet it has happened again.

   This is a matter that truly affects international peace and security.
   After two-and-a-half years of tragedy, now is the moment for the
   Security Council to uphold its political and moral responsibilities and
   demonstrate the political will to move forward in a decisive manner.

   My hope is that this incident will serve as a wake-up call for more
   determined efforts to resolve the conflict and end the unbearable
   suffering of the Syrian people.

   Thank you, Mr. President.
