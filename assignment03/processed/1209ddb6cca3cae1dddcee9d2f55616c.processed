Making your home safe for baby

   Preparing for the unexpected
   Emergencies such as natural disasters can be a scary and stressful
   time, especially for women who are pregnant or have children. But you
   can [31]take steps to prepare for unexpected events. Doing so can help
   you to stay calm and ready to act in a crisis.
     * [32]More information on making your home safe for baby

   Your baby is on the way, and there is a lot to think about. Besides
   making sure that you have baby furniture and clothing for your new son
   or daughter, you'll want to check that your home is safe. These tips
   can help you cover all the safety bases.

   Before you bring baby home:
     * Check the safety of your baby's crib and other baby items. Many new
       parents welcome hand-me-down baby items from family and friends.
       Although it's wise to save money, some products could be unsafe if
       recalled or if parts are missing or loose. Unsafe cribs and other
       items can put your baby's life in danger. Most brand new cribs and
       mattresses purchased in the United States are safe. Make sure the
       crib conforms to the current government safety standards. Also,
       check to see if hand-me-down items, such as bassinets or portable
       cribs, have been recalled. Check for recalls and get information on
       buying a safe crib and mattress at the [33]U.S. Consumer Product
       Information Safety Commission website. Or call them at
       800-638-2772.
     * Remove pillows, blankets, and stuffed animals from the crib to
       prevent your baby from suffocation.
     * Check to see that smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors in
       your home are working. Place at least one smoke detector on each
       level of your home and in halls outside of bedrooms. Have an escape
       plan in case of fire.
     * Put emergency numbers, including poison control, near each phone.
       Have at least one phone in your home connected by land line.
       Cordless phones do not work when the power is out, and cellphone
       batteries can run out.
     * Make sure your home or apartment number is easy to see so fire or
       rescue can locate you quickly in an emergency.
     * Make sure handrails are installed and secure in stairways. Always
       hold the handrail when using stairs, especially when holding your
       baby.

   Your baby will be crawling before you know it. Most babies begin
   crawling around six to nine months. Crawling on your hands and knees
   will reveal many dangers to your baby. Thinking ahead to the toddler
   years will help you to take care of other hazards before your baby
   grows and finds them first. Here are some things to do before your baby
   is crawling:
     * Cover all unused electrical sockets with outlet plugs.
     * Keep chords out of baby's reach. Tack up chords to vertical blinds
       and move furniture, lamps, or electronics to hide chords.
     * Secure furniture and electronics, such as bookcases and TVs, so
       they cannot be pulled down on top of your baby.
     * Use protective padding to cover sharp edges and corners, such as
       from a coffee table or fireplace hearth.
     * Install safety gates at the bottom and top of stairwells or to
       block entry to unsafe rooms.
     * Use safety latches on cabinets and doors.
     * Store all medicines, cleaning products, and other poisons out of
       baby's reach.
     * Remove rubber tips from doorstops or replace with one-piece
       doorstops.
     * Look for and remove all small objects. Objects that easily can pass
       through the center of a toilet paper roll might cause choking.
     * Keep houseplants out of baby's reach. Some plants can poison or
       make your baby sick.
     * Set you water heater temperature to no higher than 125 degrees
       Fahrenheit. Water that is hotter can cause bad burns.
     * Closely supervise your baby around a family pet. Pets need time to
       adjust to a new baby.
