   Planning on heading off to a Bears game, or any other NFL game this
   season? Not only is that seat going to cost you more (unless you're a
   Bucs, Jets or Bills fan, for which you have our sympathy), most
   everything else that goes along with watching a game is going to cost
   more compared to 2012.

   In fact, it's a good idea to just plan on paying for the day with
   plastic â unless you're OK with walking around with a wad of cash that
   would make Chief Keef envious.
