Star-Spangled Banner

   [13]The Star-Spangled Banner
   Francis Scott Key (1779-1843)
   [14]"The Star-Spangled Banner."
   Baltimore: Thomas Carr, 1814
   Printed sheet music
   [15]Enlarged
   [16]Music Division
   Purchase, 1941 (29.1)

   In 1814, Francis Scott Key wrote new words for a well-known drinking
   song, "To Anacreon in Heaven," to celebrate America's recent victory
   over the British. However, only in 1931, following a twenty-year effort
   during which more than forty bills and joint resolutions were
   introduced in Congress, was a law finally signed proclaiming "The Star
   Spangled Banner" to be the national anthem of the United States.

   The present copy, one of only five known to have been made by Key, is
   the earliest of four dating from the period 1840-1842 near the end of
   his life.

   Shown here is a copy of the first printed edition combining words and
   music -- one of only ten copies known to exist.
