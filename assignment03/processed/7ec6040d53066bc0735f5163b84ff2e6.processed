How not to make friends and influence people

   David Horowitz

   The Republican National Committee's spring meeting is underway in Los
   Angeles this week, and one of the top items on the agenda is the
   party's drive to "[3]broaden the GOP's appeal with voters" and "reach
   out to new voters, specifically Asian Americans, blacks, Hispanics and
   young people."

   Those certainly sound like sensible goals, especially for a party
   that's struggling with low popularity, a tarnished brand, and a
   narrowing base of support.

   But to help "broaden the GOP's appeal with voters," the Republican
   National Committee has turned to a rather motley crew to offer the
   party guidance. As we [4]discussed yesterday, one of the invited guests
   at the spring meeting is former Vice President Dick Cheney, but he
   [5]won't be alone.

     In addition to Cheney, Priebus told national committee members that
     influential conservative opinion makers Hugh Hewitt, David Horowitz
     and Larry Solov will also address the RNC's spring meeting.

   Oh, for crying out loud.

   Look, I don't blame the RNC for wanting to "reach out to new voters,
   specifically Asian Americans, blacks, Hispanics and young people." I
   also don't blame the RNC for seeking guidance from others, since folks
   inside the Republican National Committee [6]clearly don't know how to
   broaden the party's appeal on their own.

   But even if we put Cheney and his record of spectacular failures aside,
   if the RNC expects to receive worthwhile guidance from David Horowitz
   and Hugh Hewitt, I have some bad news for Reince Priebus and Co.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Horowitz, for example, is one of the nation's most abrasive
   [7]anti-Muslim activists, a notorious [8]conspiracy theorist who's
   dabbled in some [9]ugly racial politics, and someone who believes
   political correctness will lead to a "[10]totalitarian future." He's
   also written books with titles like "Hating Whitey and Other
   Progressive Causes" and "The Race Card: White Guilt, Black Resentment,
   and the Assault on Truth and Justice."

   And who better to help broaden the RNC's appeal than the guy who wrote
   "Hating Whitey"?

   Hewitt, meanwhile, is a well-known far-right radio host and blogger who
   spent parts of 2012 telling Republican voters that there was a media
   conspiracy to [11]skew polling results. A compilation of Hewitt's
   greatest hits is challenging, but note that 20 years ago, when he
   helped oversee the creation of the Nixon Library, he wanted to screen
   researchers who could make use of the facility, restricting those he
   deemed insufficiently conservative.

   He went on to become an enthusiastic Romney [12]cheerleader and
   over-the-top critic of President Obama. In 2008, Hewitt reflected on a
   college football game and [13]said, "[I]t's probably the last football
   game we'll ever get to see before the United States gets blown up by
   the Islamists under Obama."

   My personal favorite Hewitt moment came in 2005, when the Republican
   pundit tried to shield George W. Bush from blame over the response to
   Hurricane Katrina, instead [14]blaming reporters who he said failed to
   warn New Orleans in advance about the severity of the storm.

   The RNC sure knows how to pick 'em.

   You got that right. However, I am not sure Rush reflects in a mirror.
   If he did, he'd see what he has become, and so far there's no evidence
   that he has any idea that he is a monster.

   The GOP is flummoxed by the fact that the populist mask they have worn
   to disguise their obeisance to the 1% isn't cutting the mustard any
   longer.

   They have relied on culture wars and race wars and wars on women to
   mobilize their voter coalitions in the past -- always against someone,
   some thing. But it's no longer working.

   There is no way that the Republican party is going to appeal to any of
   those groups that voted for the Dems unless they CHANGE their policies.
   They have to get off the cut taxes for the rich and cut programs for
   the poor and almost poor bandwagon. Their ideas are growing very stale
   and at least 51% of the voters are onto them. Unfortunately for them
   only 47% (that is how many voted for Romney) are all that they can
   bamboozal these days.

   I think Mr. Horowitz and others are counting on the fact that "ugly
   racial politics" is a smart strategy in a faltering economy. See Greece
   with its emerging neo-Nazi party. As one article I read put it "In an
   era of crushing debt and poverty, the immigrant is blamed for almost
   every Greek ill." So if the GOP can do its best to prevent an economic
   recovery, then racial politics will seem to be a winning hand to play.

   Why don't they just makes policies that appeal to Americans and stop
   playing the triple D game? (Democratic Demographic Dupe)

   It seems like the more you try to make statements regrading one certain
   group, you are only trying to grab their votes (like immigration)

   Focus on trying to win an election based on the will of all people and
   not just one or two groups.

   Interesting piece on the RNC meeting [143]here.

     But RNC chairman Reince Priebus insists that this time will be
     different. He has pledged to spend $10 million building a ground
     operation in those communities - making the party more nimble in
     addressing misperceptions about its candidates' views or preventing
     some of the most strident voices within the party from shaping the
     narrative on issues such as illegal immigration.

   The world is growing less religious. While I respect those who maintain
   their faith, my belief in the scientific method has produced sufficient
   evidence for me to move from being religious to being more agnostic.

   You want to grow the GOP brand, then be willing to construct
   conservative values outside the scope of religion and its inherent (and
   undeniable) intolerance. Until then, the GOP will continue to shrink

   What the republicans don't (wouldn't?) see is that actions speak louder
   than words.

   As long as the actions from republicans in the states they control
   continue to be ant-Constitution of these United States, they will lose
   ground, but the media and democrats need to keep the republican's BS in

   The point is that they truly believe that they don't have a problem
   with their policies or positions, but they just need to present them in
   a better way. They have said as much multiple times. Fortunately, they
   will not sway women or minority voters by putting a new spin on the
   same old policies. They want to appeal to women, but continue to try to
   pass legislation limiting access to women's medical care and even
   contraception. They want to win Latino voters, but their party's policy
   is still to oppose a path to citizenship, even for the "dreamers." They
   want black voters but continue to push for measures that make it harder
   for them to vote. They don't have a messaging problem, they have a
   thinking problem.

   I've been saying this for years now. The Republican Party is no longer.
   It is dead. Who killed it? The Tea Party did. These racists,
   masquerading as a legitimate political force, latched on to the GOP
   like the leeches they are, with the help of Dick Army and the Koch Head
   Brothers. With far right wing extreme views and the non-willingness to
   compromise on anything, they they have buried the GOP. The only way for
   this party to gain any kind of future and growth is rid themselves of
   these nutcases.
