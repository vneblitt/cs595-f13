Entrepreneurship is the focus of university's latest living-learning
community

   BLACKSBURG, Va., July 9, 2013 - Virginia Tech's newest living-learning
   community will focus on entrepreneurship.

   Led by a faculty director from the [160]Pamplin College of Business and
   located in a stand-alone house at 2475 [161]Oak Lane, the
   "[162]Innovate" living-learning community will give 35 students the
   chance to immerse themselves in the many facets of entrepreneurship -
   from brainstorming ideas to concept development, demographic research
   to product design, writing a business plan to securing funding, and
   creating a marketing campaign to final implementation.

   Innovate will begin in the fall semester as a two-year pilot program.
   This month, first-year students of all majors have the opportunity to
   apply for the living-learning community.

   "Linking academic initiatives with residential life is a growing
   enterprise at Virginia Tech," said [163]Mark G. McNamee, senior vice
   president and provost. "The Innovate project provides a great
   opportunity for students interested in entrepreneurship to expand their
   classroom experiences by living and working with other students who
   share their passion for innovation. The house in Oak Lane will provide
   a high quality space to launch this program and evaluate future
   opportunities."

   Innovate will take a multigenerational, multidisciplinary approach to
   generating and developing entrepreneurial endeavors. Students from a
   variety of majors will work in a high-energy environment, interacting
   with faculty ambassadors, alumni coaches, a live-in residential
   learning coordinator, a graduate director, and upper division students.
   Team-building activities, discussion groups, and social events will
   encourage camaraderie and creativity, while state-of-the-art
   communication technologies in the residence will make it easy to
   connect with practicing entrepreneurs around the world.

   Innovate was conceived and planned as a collaborative effort of the
   [164]provost's office, the [165]Division of Student Affairs, Pamplin
   College of Business, and the department of [166]Housing and Residence
   Life.

   "It is essential to the learning enterprise to have the expertise and
   collaboration of a wide range of curricular and co-curricular
   departments at Virginia Tech," said [167]Patty Perillo, vice president
   for Student Affairs. "Under the provost's leadership, this vision has
   been forming for some time. The concept got off the ground quickly when
   a number of people around the university recognized a great opportunity
   to work together and create the synergies that facilitate learning for
   our students."

   "We are very pleased to help lead this effort to enrich the educational
   experience," said Pamplin dean [168]Robert Sumichrast. "Through courses
   in our management department, we have been preparing students to take
   an entrepreneurial approach in managing within any context, from
   startups to large organizations."

   The Innovate program, Sumichrast said, will allow students to learn
   about entrepreneurship and build important skills, such as leadership,
   strategic planning, project management, and how to recognize
   opportunities. "At the end of the program, these students will not only
   have experience, skills, and knowledge but also have a network of
   colleagues and mentors that will help them launch their innovative
   ideas."

   As with other Virginia Tech [169]living-learning communities, Innovate
   will place a heavy emphasis on student engagement with faculty and
   staff, providing opportunities to gain knowledge both in and out of the
   classroom, and creating a physical space that encourages and enriches
   the learning experience. The Innovate house features several study
   lounges, a conference room, a living room with a Hokie Stone fireplace,
   and a large kitchen and dining area. Rooms will be double occupancy
   with private baths.

   "This house in the Oak Lane community is the ideal incubator for the
   entrepreneurial spirit," said [170]Frank Shushok Jr., associate vice
   president for Student Affairs. "With plenty of spaces for collaboration
   and group meetings, it is an environment that will spark interaction
   and ideas."

   First-year students interested in applying to Innovate can [171]visit
   the program's website. The application process includes submitting a
   letter of intent and a resume by Friday, July 26, 2013. The cost for
   living in the Innovate house is comparable to similar rooms in the
   residential colleges at Ambler-Johnston, another living-learning
   initiative at Virginia Tech. [172]For more information, send inquiries
   via email.

   The [173]Division of Student Affairs at Virginia Tech encompasses
   departments dedicated to providing a rich co-curricular experience and
   essential student services. Virtually every aspect of a student's life
   outside the classroom is represented through the division's
   departments.
