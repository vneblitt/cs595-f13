FEATURE: United Nations breaks tradition to bring real diplomacy to Model UN

   30 August 2013 - The United Nations is educating students on how things
   are actually done inside its chambers by launching a new UN guide for
   Model UN, the first time the Organization has tried to change the
   direction in which the role-playing diplomatic simulations have
   evolved.

   "Through our interactions with Model UN conferences around the world,
   we have learned that most traditional Model UNs do not mirror the way
   the United Nations actually functions. MUN simulations use different
   rules of procedure and do not typically adopt resolutions by consensus
   that is now the common trend at the UN," said Maher Nasser, Director of
   Outreach in the UN Department of Public Information.

   In an effort to educate organizers of Model UN (MUN) about the
   differences, the Organization created the "UN Guide for MUN" and has
   been introducing it in UN workshops, like the one held this week for 80
   participants from 36 countries at the New York headquarters.

   In a Model UN, students take on the roles of ambassadors in simulated
   sessions of the General Assembly or Security Council, and research and
   debate a wide range of topics drawn from the UN's agenda.

   In that respect, MUN and the United Nations not so far apart; the
   differences really start to emerge in the details of how the
   discussions take place.

   "There is a huge gap between how the Model and the UN actually work. We
   work with parliamentary caucus style and the UN does not. So there are
   a million points of order that you do at Model UN that do not happen in
   the real UN," said workshop participant Aura Maria Gualdron.

   A 15-year veteran of MUNs, Ms. Gualdron is working with the local
   government and the UN Information Centre (UNIC) in her native Colombia
   to organize a simulation that will include the ongoing peace process
   negotiations. Scheduled for next year, the Simulación del Modelo de las
   Naciones Unidas (SimONU) will include abut 1,600 first-time MUN student
   delegates from private and public schools.

   Since the 1940s, Model UN conferences have been held around the world.
   Some schools use Model UN as part of their curricula, others support
   their students in planning conferences as leadership opportunities.

   In Azerbaijan, preparations are now underway for an October 21-25
   session of Model UN Security Council organized in cooperation with the
   Ministry of Youth and Sport. The timing coincides with the rotating
   presidency of Azerbaijan at the real Security Council in New York, and
   will include young representatives from the same 15 countries that
   currently make up the Council.

   "We want to use the momentum to showcase to the world the membership of
   Azerbaijan," said Vugar Allahverdiyev, Programme Adviser at UN
   Development Programme ([72]UNDP) in that country.

   Mr. Allahverdiyev has been working with the Department of Public
   Information to align the simulation that is being organized in
   Azerbaijan with practices at the UN, one of the reasons he is at the
   workshop, as well as to get the word out about the debate.

   "This is a good networking opportunity. It is also a good opportunity
   for us to share different experiences and discuss what different
   countries are doing," he added.

   Over the course of the four days, participants also heard from a
   variety of UN officials. An informal survey showed that students most
   enjoyed hearing from Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson, who
   detailed the UN priorities to the students but also gave them a bit of
   a pep talk, and Stadler Trengove, Senior Legal Officer at the UN Office
   of Legal Affairs, who detailed the rules dealing with how
   representatives are accredited and how disputes regarding
   representation are resolved, among other topics.

   "In my presentation, I gave a couple of illustrations to the Workshop
   of how the rules of procedure come alive in the cut and thrust of
   General Assembly debate," Mr. Trengove said. "I also discussed how the
   General Assembly and Security Council play different but equally
   important roles in the work of the Organization."

   One of the participants also enjoyed hearing about budget and the
   financial dimensions of the UN.

   "At Model UN kids usually say - we're going to create a program for
   this or a program for that. It could be interesting to have an option
   to make them aware of the fact that they do have to take into account
   the financial elements," said Ms. Gualdron.

   During a break between workshop sessions, Anastasia Trubnikova, a
   23-year-old Russian studying in Germany, stood with 19-year-old Finn
   Carlson from Leiden University in The Hague. [73]Secretary-General Ban
   Ki-moon, a former MUN member himself, had spoken this week at Leiden
   during an official visit to the Netherlands.

   "I'd like to think that we swapped roles," Mr. Carlson joked. "My
   friends went and there are photos on Facebook. I cannot believe I
   missed it."

   Ms. Trubnikova is organizing MUN conferences in Denmark and Germany;
   Mr. Carlson has taken part in 14 such conferences. Both share long-term
   diplomatic aspirations.

   "It has been a big dream for a while now. You hear often it's hard to
   get here, but you might as well try," said Mr. Carlson. "It's pretty
   awesome to be here. Sad the workshop is over."
