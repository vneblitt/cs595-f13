Summer in the lab

Students from local high schools get a glimpse of Harvard research

   By Peter Reuell, Harvard Staff Writer

   While 17-year-old Haley Greenslade's friends were busy working the
   usual summer jobs -- babysitting, working in movie theaters, flipping
   burgers -- she spent her break doing something different.

   Greenslade, of Masconomet Regional High School in Topsfield, was one of
   eight students who took part in a new internship program aimed at
   showing high school students how research is conducted by allowing them
   to work in one of Harvard's biology labs.

   "I never imagined I'd be working in a Harvard lab for the summer," she
   said. "It's just an amazing opportunity that's been given to us. My
   friends are amazed by what I'm doing as compared to other summer jobs.
   "

   The program is co-sponsored by Harvard's [83]Life Sciences Outreach
   Program and the [84]Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Besides
   Masconomet, participating high schools this year were Belmont, Chelsea,
   and Revere. Students spent nearly two months in the lab designing a
   "synthetic gene" and inserting it into living bacteria.

   "This experiment is part of what we call synthetic biology," said Alain
   Viel, director of [85]Northwest Undergraduate Laboratories and a senior
   lecturer on molecular and cellular biology, who oversees the internship
   program with help from research assistant Andrew Cumming. "They're
   assembling all the pieces of a gene that will go into the bacteria with
   all the bells and whistles it needs to be expressed."

   For the students, Viel said, the lab work offers a valuable inside look
   at how research really works.

   Alain Viel: "This work teaches them that what's more important is not
   to achieve their goal but to get some experience in terms of designing
   an experiment, thinking about what kind of controls you need and what
   kind of methods you can use. And when they get a piece of data, they
   have to figure out whether or not the experiment worked, and if it
   works, what will be the next step."

   "In most introductory biology courses, labs take place in a defined
   block of time, and have very specific goals," he said. "This work
   teaches them that what's more important is not to achieve their goal
   but to get some experience in terms of designing an experiment,
   thinking about what kind of controls you need and what kind of methods
   you can use. And when they get a piece of data, they have to figure out
   whether or not the experiment worked, and if it works, what will be the
   next step."

   "I feel like this is a little taste of what it's like to work in a
   lab," said 16-year-old Nilsa Salas of Chelsea High School. "I actually
   want to go into forensic science, so this is really cool -- when I was
   told I was getting into the program I was really excited."

   "It's transformative," said [86]Robert Lue, professor of the practice
   of molecular and cellular biology and director of Life Sciences
   Education. "One of the reasons we started this program is because we've
   found that research is one of the best ways for students to become
   engaged, and sustain an engagement with science.

   "For a number of years, we've worked to change the freshman science
   courses at Harvard, and we've made it very clear that, as a freshman,
   you're welcome to do research," he added. "Harvard has made an enormous
   push, in the life sciences in particular, to get students started doing
   authentic research when they're ready, and if that's in the first
   semester of their freshman year, then that's great."

   In part, Lue said, the changes came from the realization that, as
   science continues to push boundaries, faculty members and students
   alike will likely have to learn new skills and concepts on the fly.

   "What we've realized is that the old idea -- you take a whole bunch of
   courses, and then you're ready to do science -- is, for one thing,
   unnecessary, but it's also unproductive," Lue said. "What we've found
   is that, for freshmen and for high school students, even if they have
   little background, there's nothing like an actual research project to
   drive them and motivate them to go out and find what they need to
   know."

   While the program could accommodate only eight students this year, Lue
   said he is already working on ways to expand opportunities.

   "These efforts aren't just a pipeline for Harvard, but they're a
   pipeline to higher education in general," he said.

   "I believe these sorts of experiences are even more valuable than a
   class, because they're learning through the actual experience of the
   field," he added. "So it's all about knowledge, it's all about the
   experience, and it's all about being inspired by what happens. What we
   want to do is inspire them, and that's enormously important."
