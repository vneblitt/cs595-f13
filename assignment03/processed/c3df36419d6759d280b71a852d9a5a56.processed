Carrying a Torch -- Ours!

   September 10, 2013 by [14]Jennifer Gavin

   The Library of Congress (top right) overlooks its National Book
   Festival, which returns to the National Mall Saturday, Sept. 21 and
   Sunday, Sept. 22

   With the [15]Library of Congress National Book Festival just days away
   (itâs a week from this weekend, Saturday, Sept. 21 and Sunday, Sept.
   22, free of charge on the National Mall) we have a lot to share in
   addition to [16]more than 100 best-selling authors for readers of all
   ages.Â  One of the great stops at this yearâs festival will be the
   Library of Congress Pavilion.

   This year the pavilion will be more packed than ever before with a huge
   variety of offerings from the Library â itâs your opportunity to sample
   our âuniverse under the dome with the torch of knowledge on top,â
   appetizer-style.Â  The Library of Congress, despite its name, is also
   your Library, and anyone over the age of 16 can get a reader card and
   use our reading rooms to do research within our vast collections; we
   also have a Young Readers Center for children and teens to visit, and
   several museum-style exhibitions, such as our ongoing blockbuster, âThe
   Civil War in America.â All of this comes to you free of charge from the
   largest library in the world.

   This year at the National Book Festivalâs Library of Congress Pavilion,
   we will have tables featuring curators and other staff from a wide
   variety of Library divisions; we will also have two theaters where
   curators and other Library leaders will give brief presentations about
   their areas of expertise.Â  Both Saturday and Sunday, these leaders
   will give fascinating talks about topics ranging from Copyright and the
   National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (both
   of them part of the Library of Congress) to genealogy, preservation,
   educational outreach, the aforementioned Young Readers Center, the Law
   Library of Congress, the Prints & Photographs Division, the Recorded
   Sound Collections, numerous collections based on regions of the world,
   the World Digital Library, and the Music Division.Â  Signs with times
   will be posted, and times will be in the official program as well, or
   you can view the schedule [17]here.

   There will be talks by curators from our Civil War exhibition and the
   Geography & Map Division; the Veterans History Project; and the project
   that preserves old newspapers from all over the country for digital
   perusal.

   The Library of Congress Pavilion also will hold a display on âBooks
   That Shaped the World,â which will offer you the chance to vote via
   survey to nominate a book you believe shaped the world or jot its title
   on our giant whiteboard.Â  Come be heard!

   And one more thing â for those of you whoâve wanted to go home with a
   National Book Festival T-shirt â we will be offering T-shirts in
   designs for adults and kids at a special sales tent across the street
   north of the grounds, in front of the Smithsonianâs National Museum of
   American History.Â  Itâs near the book-signing area â come check it
   out.

   The Library of Congress National Book Festival will take place, rain or
   shine, on Saturday, Sept. 21 from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and on Sunday,
   Sept. 22 from noon to 5:30 p.m. on the National Mall, between 9^th and
   14^th Streets.Â  Donât miss it!

       The beauty of the Library's digital offerings is that you can
       benefit from many of our books and exhibitions on our website,
       loc.gov, which has extensive searchability through our collections;
       you might also enjoy Read.gov, the site of the Library's Center for
       the Book, which holds several digitized books, not to mention the
       World Digital Library (WDL.org), a joint project of the Library of
       Congress and UNESCO, which offers more than 200 books of world
       significance and many other fascinating manuscripts, maps and
       artworks as well. Enjoy!
