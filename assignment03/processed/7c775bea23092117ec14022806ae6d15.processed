   Britney Spears
   TITANIC Vegas Contract
   But She Can't Touch Celine
   Exclusive
   0913_britney_spears_planet_hollywood
   Britney Spears will be raking in HUGE STACKS in Vegas this winter -- a
   ridiculous $310,000 per show ... nearly $15 million per year -- but she
   still doesn't hold a candle to Celine Dion.
   TMZ is privy to the financial details of Britney's deal.  The 2-year
   contract calls for 48 shows a year at Planet Hollywood.   According to
   the contract, Britney will earn $310,000 per show.
   By contrast, Celine does 70 shows a year.  Sources say she pulls in
   $476,000 a show ... so she's way ahead of Britney in the money
   department, but Brit gets more time off.
   Britney's cut of the gate is huge -- projected sales per show are
   $508,514, meaning Brit will be snagging more than 60%.
   As we reported, producers are shooting for a "cool, hip club-like show"
   ... unlike the run-of-the-mill Vegas shows that preceded it (Celine's
   included). It starts in December.
   If that's not convincing, check out these cool 3D mock-ups of the
   stage.

   This female is all washed up! I don't know what the promoters are
   thing! She is a HAS BEEN. She's had ''her day in the sun.''
   I wouldn't go to any of her shows if they PAID me to attend...
   Am I on a different planet? She's just terrible looking & sounds even
   worse!!!

   really don't get it when people hate on others for no reason
   whatsoever..hmmmm maybe its just JEALOUSY or their life just SUCKS..!!
   two kids,meltdowns.. yet she got back up and viola!...
   the positive in this is her comeback! fighting through her drug
   addiction is positive and inspirational....people fall sometimes but it
   proves you can get back up....
   good for her......

   OMG, I was watching Miss America tonight.

   Well, there was no worthy gossip news to comment on, so what do you
   expect??

   Anyways, during the swimsuit competition, every contestant was spotting
   a camel toe. I mean, what the heck, funny as hell, how come TMZ didn't
   post any of those camel toe shots??? Uhh, that reminds me, I have not
   seen camel toe posting much anymore??? I miss you camel toe!!!!

   LOL LOL LOL!!!!

   Oh sure, sure, Celine is bigger than MJ, according to AEG, sure Celine
   gets more pay than Britney.

   The fun fact is, how much would MJ get for a show in Vegas???

   The answer is zero, zepo, nata, 'cause the crotch grabbing act is
   dead!!!

   All that money but she's still whacked in the head, constrained by a
   chemical straight jacket that prevents her from being able to think
   about anything. And let's get real: she's not intelligent to begin
   with. She's commonly known to be a stupid dunce. Waste of money for a
   lip-synching loser.

   A lib syncing show for 12 year old in Las Vegas??? I don't get it.
   Britney belongs to Disney Land with Mickey and Goofy dancing on stage.
   And BTW, that would be back to the roots for her.

   Who the f* is going to pay that money to see that fat talentless bitch
   in Las Vegas?
