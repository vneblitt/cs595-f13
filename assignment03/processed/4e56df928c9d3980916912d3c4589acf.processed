In Iran, cautious reaction to Syrian chemical weapons deal

   Kamran Jebreili/AP - Iranian parliament speaker Ali Larijani, center,
   said he was hopeful that ‚logic would prevail and extremist movements
   on the international scene will not intensify.‚

By [294]Jason Rezaian, E-mail the writer

   TEHRAN -- Iran is taking a cautious approach to [295]Saturday's
   agreement between the United States and Russia to reduce the Syrian
   government's stockpile of chemical weapons, offering a small sign that
   its leaders may see an opportunity for a diplomatic breakthrough with
   Washington in the near future.

   Twenty-four hours after the deal was announced, neither Iranian
   President Hassan Rouhani nor his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad
   Zarif, had commented on the arrangement, which greatly diminished the
   likelihood of a U.S.-led military response to the alleged Aug. 21
   [296]chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed more than 1,400
   people, including hundreds of children.

   Video
   [297]The head of Syria's main armed opposition group, Gen. Salim Idris,
   criticized the agreement between the U.S. and Russia for the Assad
   regime to give up its chemical weapons. Meanwhile, doubts persist on
   how realistic the operation can be in an active war zone.

   [307]Russia's anti-gay law casts a shadow over 2014 Olympics

   Kathy Lally

   The Sochi Games are being viewed as a battleground over the treatment
   of gays and respect for human rights.

   Ali Larijani, the speaker of Iran's parliament, is the highest-ranking
   official to offer a reaction thus far.

   On Saturday, he told a gathering of reporters in Tehran that he was
   hopeful that "logic would prevail and extremist movements on the
   international scene will not intensify. Of course what we have seen
   these past days shows a little bit of logic."

   Mohsen Rezaei, a two-time presidential candidate and former head of
   Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, was more skeptical.

   "This is a military tactic," Rezaei said. "Usually when they decide to
   attack a country, they take its most dangerous weapons first and then
   strike. What the U.S. is doing could be a political game. I hope the
   U.S. does not have such an intention and that they try to resolve the
   problem in a peaceful way."

   With the United Nations General Assembly in New York beginning in less
   than two weeks, Iran is likely trying to reduce tension between
   Washington and Tehran, as speculation mounts that high-ranking
   officials from the two countries may hold talks for the first time in
   decades.

   The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1979, when
   Iranian students invaded the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52
   Americans hostage for 444 days.
