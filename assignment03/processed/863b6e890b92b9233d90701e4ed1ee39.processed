   Overeating Night snack

   As evening turns to night, I often find myself looking for a snack.
   Sometimes the impulse comes from a bit of hunger, but I'm just as
   likely to make my way to the kitchen without thinking. I know that I'm
   not alone in this satisfying but potentially problematic habit.

   The occasional late-night snack is nothing to worry about. But nightly
   bingeing merits a closer look. Experts may debate whether nocturnal
   overeating needs its own diagnostic category, but they don't debate the
   significance of the problem.

   As described in [29]"Out of Sync," an article in the current issue of
   The Scientist, eating at the wrong time can throw off the body's
   metabolic cycles, leading to weight gain and other problems. According
   to the article, new research continues to "add to the growing
   recognition that our metabolisms are primed by the circadian machinery
   written in our genes, and that discord between the two can wreak havoc
   on our systems."

Two types of nighttime eating disorders

   Sleep-related eating disorder is a highly-publicized malady, though
   it's not clear how common it is. People with this problem eat while
   sleepwalking, or while in a twilight state between sleep and
   wakefulness. They generally aren't conscious of what they're doing, so
   they may wake up to find the bed littered with candy wrappers -- with
   no memory of consuming the candy. Dr. Brandon R. Peters, a sleep
   medicine expert affiliated with the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences
   and Medicine, described a case of sleep-related eating disorder last
   month [30]on The Huffington Post.

   A better-documented problem is night eating syndrome, in which people
   do the majority of their eating late at night. A study published in the
   [31]Journal of the American Medical Association found that by 6 p.m.,
   people with night eating syndrome consumed a little more than a third
   of their daily calories, while a control group had consumed almost
   three-quarters. Between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., however, the night eaters
   consumed 56% of daily calories, while controls consumed only 15%.

   Night eating syndrome may affect 1 or 2 out of 100 people in the
   general population. Dr. Albert J. Stunkard, a psychiatrist at the
   University of Pennsylvania, first described the disorder in the 1950s.
   Researchers have recently explored its link to weight gain. The problem
   affects anywhere from 9% to 14% of people seeking treatment at obesity
   clinics, and as many as 27% of severely obese people.

   Night eating syndrome also occurs in people who are treated in mental
   health clinics. In one study of psychiatric outpatients in Pennsylvania
   and Minnesota, 12% had night eating syndrome. Night eaters in this
   study were also much more likely than other individuals to have an
   addiction problem. Other research indicates that people with night
   eating syndrome tend to suffer from a distinct form of depression. In
   contrast to the usual pattern where depression is more pronounced in
   the early part of the day, night eaters tend to become more depressed
   during the evening.

   It's not clear what causes night eating syndrome and why it is
   associated with depression or addiction. One theory is that night
   eating syndrome involves a disruption in the hormones that regulate
   sleep, appetite, or mood. Because late-night snacking usually involves
   carbohydrate-rich "comfort" foods, this theory holds that night eating
   syndrome is a form of self-medication.

Breaking the cycle

   Sleeping and eating are almost certainly connected, given the link
   between lack of sleep and weight gain. So getting plenty of sleep may
   be a helpful substitute for nighttime trips to the refrigerator. Until
   more is known about night eating syndrome, it's probably best to take a
   broad approach to stopping it.
     * See your doctor for a complete health evaluation.
     * An evaluation by a mental health professional is a good idea to
       determine whether or not another mental disorder could be
       contributing to the eating problem. If so, treating that underlying
       mental health problem, such as depression or anxiety, may improve
       eating patterns and the chances of getting to sleep earlier.
     * See a dietitian about how to better pace meals throughout the day,
       which may help break the cycle of late-night eating.
     * Case reports indicate that some people can improve their eating
       patterns by being mindful of the problem and by trying to identify
       its triggers.
     * The type of talk therapy known as [32]cognitive behavioral therapy
       may help. Stress-reduction techniques may help avert trips to the
       refrigerator.
     * Preliminary studies indicate that the anticonvulsant topiramate
       (Topamax) or a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI)
       antidepressant such as sertraline (Zoloft) may also work.

       to be clear. subconsciously, I took foods more than usual since I
       felt I couldn't finish all that jobs if my stomach empty :D

       I used to be a major night time eater and it took me years to stop
       eating late at night! It was like I wasn't hungry between the times
       of 6 to 9 pm. I would go to bed and end up getting up at 3am and I
       would go eat. I went from 152lbs out of college wrestling to 211lbs
       in a year and then it took me 2yrs to lose the weight correctly and
       to stop eating at night. I found it was a nutritional matter and
       once I realigned my dietary habits I stopped eating late at night.
       It was a blood sugar complication. Great article!
