Woods expects low scoring at Conway Farms

Winner of five Western Opens and BMW Championships at Cog Hill thinks new
venue will yield lots of birdies

   By Teddy Greenstein, Tribune reporter

   7:10 a.m. CDT, September 12, 2013
   So, Tiger Woods, what is your single greatest moment in Chicago?

   "Probably Medinah," he replied.

   Which one?

   "Winning there twice," he said.

   When you're Woods, you don't have to choose. He won the 1999 and 2006
   PGA Championships at Medinah, and his run at Cog Hill was outrageous --
   victories at the Western Open/BMW Championship in 1997, `99, '03, '07
   and '09.

   Considering Cog Hill didn't host in 2008 and 2012 and Woods didn't
   qualify in 2011, he went 5-for-12 as a pro at Dubsdread.

   "Chicago is a great sporting town," Woods said after completing his
   Wednesday pro-am round. "They come out and support their events."

   Take Jeffery Goree, a Chicagoan who caught Woods' attention on the 15th
   hole by holding up his Illinois license plate. It reads, "TI GR WDS."

   "I've had it since 1997," Goree said. "This is the front plate, of
   course, because my sticker goes on the back."

   Goree, wearing a Cubs hat, said Woods laughed when he saw the plate and
   told him, "That's pretty cool."

   Then Woods tossed him a ball with a black "TIGER" stamp.

   "This will be a fun crowd," Woods said. "And the golf course is in
   absolutely perfect shape, so it's going to be a fun week."

   Woods expects Conway Farms, the BMW's new home, to yield lots of
   birdies.

   "It's a different mindset," he said. "If you drive the ball well here,
   you're going to have a lot of 8-iron (approaches) on down, and those
   are some scoring clubs. There is a lot of funneling where you can get
   to some of these pins. You don't have to fire right at the flag (to)
   get the ball pretty stiff.

   "Yeah, the scores are going to be low."

   One thing could change that: The forecast in Lake Forest calls for
   windy conditions Thursday and cool temperatures (50s and lower 60s)
   Friday and Saturday.

   "I'm sure the greens will be a lot faster because they'll be dry,"
   Woods said. "And the ball won't be carrying as far -- probably about 5
   percent less."

   Steve Stricker agreed that if the weather is decent, the scoring will
   be "pretty good."

   "It's pretty generous off the tee," the Illinois alumnus and Madison,
   Wis., resident said. "The green complexes are the challenge. There is a
   lot of movement in the greens."

   Another Midwesterner, Iowa native Zach Johnson, said the scoring will
   depend on the weather. A preview came Wednesday, when hot and sticky
   conditions gave way to afternoon showers and temperatures in the 70s.

   "How dramatic that shift will be, I don't know, but they're talking
   substantial change," Johnson said. "If the wind does not pick up, par
   is not going to be a great score come four days. The fairways are
   pretty easy to hit for the most part, and the rough isn't exactly
   treacherous. The greens are the defense here."

   The par-5 18th hole measures 570 yards with a creek that crosses the
   fairway twice. But Woods plans to reach the green with either a driver
   and 4-iron or a 3-wood and 5-wood or 3-iron. He sees it as an eagle
   opportunity.

   "If the pin is on the left side," he said, "you're going to see some
   3s."
