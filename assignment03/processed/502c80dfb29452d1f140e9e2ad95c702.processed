Library of Congress Announces Second Legislative Data Challenge

   The Library of Congress, at the request of the U.S. House of
   Representatives, is again using the Challenge.gov platform to advance
   the exchange of legislative information worldwide.

   Akoma Ntoso ([19]www.akomantoso.org(external link)) is a framework used
   in many other countries around the world to annotate and format
   electronic versions of parliamentary, legislative and judiciary
   documents. The challenge, "Legislative XML Data Mapping," invites
   competitors to map the Akoma Ntoso schema to established U.S. and
   United Kingdom legislative markup languages to improve Akoma Ntosoâs
   support of U.S. and U.K. legislative data.

   The mapping challenge results will complement those anticipated from a
   previously announced challenge, "Markup of U.S. Legislation in Akoma
   Ntoso", which opened in July and closes Oct. 31, 2013.

   "The Library works closely with the Congress and related agencies to
   make Americaâs federal legislative record more widely available through
   Congress.gov," said Robert Dizard Jr., Deputy Librarian of Congress.
   "Taken together, the information from these challenges will build on
   that accessibility goal by advancing the possibilities related to
   international frameworks. We are pleased to be cooperating with the
   United Kingdom on this effort."

   Challenge participants would attempt to map elements found in select
   U.S. and U.K. bill Extensible Markup Language (XML)âa flexible
   international format for structuring dataâto the tags used to create
   Akoma Ntoso. Participants will be expected to identify any issues that
   appear when conducting the mapping, recommend solutions to resolve
   those issues and provide information on the tools used to process or
   map the bill information.

   The new mapping challenge, which opened today and closes Dec. 31, 2013,
   is extended to participants 18 years of age or older. For the official
   rules and more detailed information about the challenge or to enter a
   submission, visit
   [20]legislative-data-mapping.challengepost.com(external link).

   The competitionâs four judges are experts in either U.S. legislation
   XML standards, U.K. legislation XML standards, or the Akoma Ntoso legal
   schema. The Library of Congress will announce the winner of the $10,000
   prize on Feb. 12, 2014.

   Challenge.gov is an online platform administered by the U.S. General
   Services Administration in partnership with ChallegePost that empowers
   the U.S. government and the public to bring the best ideas and top
   talent to bear on our nationâs most pressing challenges. Submissions
   can range from simple suggestions to complex proofs of concept, designs
   or finished products that solve the grand challenges of the 21st
   century. The Libraryâs first legislative data challenge, Markup of U.S.
   Legislation in Akoma Ntoso is available at
   [21]akoma-ntoso-markup.challengepost.com(external link).

   Founded in 1800, the Library of Congress is the nationâs oldest federal
   cultural institution. The Library seeks to spark imagination and
   creativity and to further human understanding and wisdom by providing
   access to knowledge through its magnificent collections, programs,
