The Economic Benefits of Providing a Path to Earned Citizenship
       Cecilia Muñoz and Gene Sperling
       August 13, 2013

       Today, the White House [152]released a report detailing the
       economic benefits of providing a path to earned citizenship for the
       11 million undocumented immigrants currently living and working in
       the U.S. shadow economy. As highlighted in the report, a range of
       economic research has shown that immigrants living and working in
       the United States without authorization are earning far less than
       their potential, paying much less in taxes, and contributing
       significantly less to the U.S. economy than they would if they were
       given the opportunity to gain legal status and earn U.S.
       citizenship. According to outside estimates, providing earned
       citizenship for these workers would increase their wages and, over
       10 years, boost U.S. GDP by $1.4 trillion, increase total income
       for all Americans by $791 billion, generate $184 billion in
       additional state and federal tax revenue from currently
       undocumented immigrants, and add about 2 million jobs to the U.S.
       economy.
       A strong majority of Americans from diverse states and political
       backgrounds support a path to earned citizenship. However, some in
       Congress have suggested that immigration reform should provide only
       legal status, without any opportunity for those who are getting on
       the right side of the law to earn their way to citizenship. This
       "legalization-only" approach violates a basic principle of our
       country: that anyone, no matter where they came from, can become an
       American citizen if they're willing to work for it and take on the
       responsibilities of citizenship. We cannot afford a system that
       creates a group which can never become fully American, denying
       equal rights to people who pay the same taxes and play by the same
       rules even after they've paid a penalty and gotten on the right
       side of the law.
       And in addition, the research shows the significant economic costs
       - in terms of lost growth, earnings, tax revenues, and jobs -
       associated with failing to provide a path to earned citizenship for
       these families. Compared to the benefits of citizenship, providing
       legal status alone to currently undocumented workers would, over 10
       years, result in $568 billion less GDP, and $321 billion less total
       income. An estimated 820,000 fewer total jobs would be created, and
       federal and state governments would lose out on $75 billion in
       additional tax revenue according to outside estimates.
       There are likely a number of factors that explain why citizenship
       provides even greater wage and economic benefits than legalization
       alone, including jobs and licenses people are only eligible for as
       citizens; jobs that require travel, which is often easier for those
       with U.S. passports; and citizenship serving as a signal to
       employers that a person means to stay in the U.S.
       The largest factor, however, may be the less tangible one: greater
       certainty that accompanies citizenship leads to more investment,
       for example, in education and training, or more willingness to take
       the risk of starting a business.
       The bipartisan Border Security, Economic Opportunity and
       Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) passed by the Senate is an
       opportunity for our country to finally fix its broken immigration
       system. This commonsense legislation, drafted and supported by both
       Democrats and Republicans, has four pillars: (1) continue to
       strengthen our borders; (2) crack down on companies that hire
       undocumented workers; (3) hold undocumented immigrants accountable
       before they can earn their citizenship by requiring them to pass
       background checks, pay penalties and their taxes, learn English,
       and go to the back of the line; and (4) streamline the legal
       immigration system for families, workers, and employers.
       Economists, business leaders, and American workers agree - we must
       take advantage of this historic opportunity to fix our broken
       immigration system in a comprehensive way. To this end, the
       President urges the House of Representatives to take action and
       stands willing to work with all parties to make sure that
       commonsense immigration reform with an earned path to citizenship
       becomes a reality as soon as possible.

       of the National Economic Council and Assistant to the President for
       Economic Policy.
