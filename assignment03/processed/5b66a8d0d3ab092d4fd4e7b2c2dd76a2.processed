What You Can Do

   Person getting their blood drawn.

   High cholesterol increases your risk for heart disease. People at any
   age can take steps to keep cholesterol levels normal.

Get a Blood Test

   High cholesterol usually has no signs or symptoms. Only a doctor's
   check will reveal it.

   Your doctor can do a simple blood test to check your cholesterol
   levels. The test is called a lipoprotein profile. It measures several
   kinds of cholesterol as well as triglycerides. Some doctors do a
   simpler blood test that just checks total and HDL cholesterol.

   [15]The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends that healthy
   adults get their cholesterol levels checked every five years.
          Desirable Cholesterol Levels
      Total cholesterol     Less than 200 mg/dL
   LDL ("bad" cholesterol)  Less than 100 mg/dL*
   HDL ("good" cholesterol) 40 mg/dL or higher
        Triglycerides       Less than 150 mg/dL

   * Note: Optimal level.

Eat a Healthy Diet

   A healthy diet can help keep blood cholesterol levels down. Avoid
   saturated fat, trans fats, and dietary cholesterol, which tend to raise
   cholesterol levels. Other types of fats, such as monounsaturated and
   polyunsaturated fats, can actually lower blood cholesterol levels.
   Eating fiber can also help lower cholesterol.

   For some people, eating too many carbohydrates can lower HDL (good
   cholesterol) and raise triglycerides. Drinking alcohol can also raise
   triglycerides. Too much alcohol can cause high blood pressure, which
   increases the risk for heart disease and stroke.

   For more information on healthy diet and nutrition, see [16]CDC's
   Nutrition and Physical Activity and Obesity Program Web site.

Maintain a Healthy Weight

   Being overweight or obese can raise your bad cholesterol levels. Losing
   weight can help lower your cholesterol.

   To determine whether your weight is in a healthy range, doctors often
   calculate a number called the body mass index (BMI). Doctors sometimes
   also use waist and hip measurements to measure a person's excess body
   fat.

   If you know your weight and height, you can compute your BMI at
   [17]CDC's Assessing Your Weight Web site.

Exercise Regularly

   Physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and lower
   cholesterol. The Surgeon General recommends adults engage in
   moderate-intensity exercise for 2 hours and 30 minutes every week.

   For more information see [18]CDC's Nutrition and Physical Activity and
   Obesity Program Web site.

Don't Smoke

   Smoking injures blood vessels and speeds up the hardening of the
   arteries. Smoking greatly increases a person's risk for heart disease
   and stroke.

   If you don't smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, quitting will lower
   your risk for heart disease and stroke. Your doctor can suggest
   programs to help you stop smoking.

   Breathing secondhand smoke increases a person's risk for a heart attack
   and other heart conditions.^1

   For more information about tobacco use and quitting, see [19]CDC's
   Smoking & Tobacco Use Web site.

Treat High Cholesterol

   If you have high cholesterol, your doctor may prescribe medications in
   addition to lifestyle changes. Controlling LDL cholesterol is the
   primary focus of treatment.

   Your treatment plan will depend on your current LDL level and risk for
   heart disease and stroke. Your risk for heart disease and stroke
   depends on other risk factors including high blood pressure, smoking
   status, age, HDL level, and family history of early heart disease. In
   addition, people with existing cardiovascular disease or diabetes are
   at high risk.

   You can estimate your risk for heart disease by using the [20]10-year
   risk calculator of the National Cholesterol Education Program at the
   National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Web site.

   Several types of medications help lower cholesterol--
   Type of Medicine How They Work
   Statin drugs

   Statin drugs lower LDL cholesterol by slowing down the liver's
   production of cholesterol. They also increase the liver's ability to
   remove LDL cholesterol already in the blood.

   For more information, see the FDA's advice on statin risks at
   [21]http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm048496.htm and
   [22]http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm293330.htm.
   Bile acid sequestrants Bile acid sequestrants help remove cholesterol
   from the blood stream by eliminating bile acids. The body needs bile
   acids and makes them by breaking down LDL cholesterol.
   Niacin, or nicotinic acid Niacin is a B vitamin that can improve all
   lipoprotein levels. Nicotinic acid raises HDL cholesterol levels while
   lowering total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.
   Treatment requires high levels of niacin with possible side effects and
   so requires medical supervision.
   Fibrates Fibrates mainly lower triglycerides and, to a lesser extent,
   increase HDL levels.

   All drugs may have side effects, so talk with your doctor on a regular
   basis. Once your cholesterol levels have improved, your doctor will
   want to monitor them.

   Lifestyle changes are just as important as taking medicines.
