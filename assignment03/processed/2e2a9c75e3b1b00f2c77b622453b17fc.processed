[8]Podcast #52 - We Didn't Need Headphones

   09-03-13 by [9]Alex Miller. [10]18 comments

   Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #52 with your hosts Joel Spolsky,
   David Fullerton and Jay Hanlon. Today's show is brought to you by
   Marmite Yeast Extract - you either love it, or hate it! (You probably
   hate it.) Joining us today are Careers 2.0 Marketing Coordinator
   Bethany Marzipan, er, Marzewski and Careers 2.0 Product Manager Will
   Cole.
     * Site Milestones: Space continues to be all around us, everywhere.
       It's also a [11]Stack Exchange site, but we've talked about it
       already.
     * Our new milestone is [12]Digital Fabrication, which will probably
       be in public beta by the time this podcast airs. It's about modern
       iterative manufacturing (3D printing, for example).
     * New Features: Our [13]Android alpha is continuing, and we now have
       someone working on the iOS version (but that's a long way away from
       alpha). Another minor change: we got rid of the automatic downvote
       from the Community user when a question got closed. Since you no
       longer have to pay 1 rep to downvote a question, this was no longer
       really necessary.
     * Featured Site: [14]Skeptics! This is a great example of a site
       whose community has taken the engine in a very interesting, odd,
       and wholly successful new direction.
          + [15]This is Doubting Thomas.
          + It's sort of like the MythBusters (who [16]folded a piece of
            paper eight times)... except better!
          + Skeptics has rules you can't break: your question must
            reference a notableclaim, and the answers must have referenced
            sources.
          + Examples:
               o [17]Will a mother bird abandon her young if touched by a
                 human?
               o [18]Did people think the Earth was flat?
               o [19]Is there any evidence of a "mosquito line"?
               o [20]Do expensive, "premium" speaker cables actually make
                 a difference?
     * And now we turn to our guests! Let's talk about recruiting
       programmers. Recruiters are terrible. They make people take down
       their LinkedIn profiles just to avoid getting messages from
       headhunters. Our hosts and our guests step through the issues
       related to recruiting developers, and how to solve them. (Good
       thing we're working on a way to fix the problem, too! It will be
       perfect in 6-8 weeks.)
     * Also, Jeff Atwood [21]designed a keyboard.
     * If your employer isn't great at recruiting, have them check out
       the [22]Careers 2.0 Blog. Bethany and the rest of the team are
       building up a compendium of great information for hiring employers
       over there.

   Thanks for listening to Stack Exchange Podcast #52. Marmite may be
   stored at room temperature, even after it's been opened.

   Was the link "a way to fix the problem" intentionally left blank? Just
   trying to build up suspense?
   Victor [30]Sep 3 2013

   how can I subscribe to this podcast on iTunes?
   pnuts [31]Sep 3 2013

   One of the images for the keyboard shows a number pad.
   [32]Isaac Moses [33]Sep 3 2013

   According to [this
   answer]([34]http://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/5089/2) on Mi Yodeya,
   Vegemite, the Australian equivalent of Marmite, is certified Kosher.

   THe flat earth myth is widely known:

   [39]Peter Demel [40]Sep 5 2013

   Very interesting post. Thanks for sharing this.
   [41]Oddthinking [42]Sep 5 2013

   The user name "Monkey Tuesday", which was mentioned on the show, is a
   reference to a weekly segment on the former radio show Penn Radio,
   hosted by noted skeptic, Penn Jillette.
   pnuts [43]Sep 5 2013

   How does one flag a comment here as spam?
   Anonymous Coward [44]Sep 5 2013

   It's kind of sad/surprising that the job market in the USA has 4
   openings for each programmer. Meanwhile here in Europe we have
   approaching 50% unemployment and more like 4 programmers per job
   opening. Then there's the temp contracts and crap pay...

   I'm fortunate enough to have been in a decent job doing interesting
   stuff for several years, but if I were to look for a new gig... well, I
   do not believe I would find it as easy as this podcast makes out.

   I don't live in the sticks either, I live in a big city in western
   europe, but.. well, the idealistic view of "the employers fight over
   coders!" just doesn't seem to match with reality, and for some reason
   it rubbed me the wrong way.
   Jon Ericson [45]Sep 5 2013

   @pnuts: When spam sneaks past the WordPress spamfilter, one of us needs
   to hunt it down. Spam on old posts often goes unnoticed, though we get
   occasional reports in [46]The Assembly.

   There's an [47]idea on meta that's been on the back burner for a while
   to change our blogging platform. Don't hold your breathe, but it would
   make spam a lot easier for the community to handle (among other
   improvements like Markdown support).
   Snowmanzzz [48]Sep 5 2013

   +1 @Victor search for "Stack Exchange Podcast" in the iTunes Store,
   click on "The Stack Exchange Podcast" under the "Podcasts" heading on
   the results page, and then click on the "Subscribe" button.
   Cody Gray [49]Sep 5 2013

   Okay, I'll bite... What exactly is "code"-related about that keyboard
   Jeff designed? It just looks like a bog-standard keyboard. There are
   tons of companies that make high-quality keyboards with mechanical key
   switches. Yes, they are a good investment, but not just for
   programmers. And nothing against Jeff, but I can't see anything novel
   there that he might have designed. Unless you count ripping off the
   numeric keypad--fewer keys for the same price!
   [50]Anna Lear [51]Sep 5 2013

   @CodyGray Not sure about innovation and all that, but it's surprisingly
   hard to find a well-made backlit mechanical keyboard if you're into
   that sort of thing.

   I have two versions of the Razer BlackWidow and while they're pretty
   good keyboards, they have a column of macro keys that I'm never going
   to use (even for gaming). The backlighting is also kind of muddy.

   I was kind of excited by CODE using clear switches too, although not
   enough to buy yet another expensive keyboard.
   pnuts [52]Sep 6 2013

   @Jon Ericson Many thanks for explanation. I note spam in question has
   now disappeared - no problem.
   Jon Ericson [53]Sep 6 2013

   @pnuts: I can neither confirm nor deny I had anything to do with the
   removal of spam. ;-)
   Alenni [54]Sep 17 2013

   Props to Skeptics! The questions there are indeed interesting
   Pete [55]Sep 29 2013

   So what's wrong with me if I don't get any hits from recruiters on my
   LinkedIn profile? I think I've probably been contacted maybe less than
   10 times since I signed up years ago. It's filled out with my work
   history but that's about it - no statement, no profile pic, just a
   basic resume and my connections.
