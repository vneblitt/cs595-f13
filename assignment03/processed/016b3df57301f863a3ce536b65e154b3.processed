Ducklings rescued after falling through storm drain at shopping plaza

   PITTSFIELD -- As Dalton resident Rebecca Besaw and her daughter Riley
   Kincaid were driving through the Berkshire Crossing shopping plaza
   Monday afternoon, they noticed a mother duck and her half-dozen
   ducklings walking along the street.

   Then it happened.

   After the mother duck crossed a storm drain cover, her ducklings -- one
   by one -- "all just fell in," Besaw said.

   Besaw quickly pulled off to an isolated parking lot in the shopping
   center. Tammy Proctor, another Dalton resident in the shopping center,
   also pulled over, unsure what was happening.

   "I thought it was an accident at first," Proctor said.

   What transpired was a three-hour rescue mission to reunite the
   ducklings with their mother, an act of kindness that brought together
   about a dozen Berkshire residents.

   Besaw and Proctor removed the storm drain and saw three of the
   ducklings. Another man who stopped to help climbed into the sewer and
   scooped the three ducklings out with a cardboard box. Others at the
   scene transported them to a nearby bush, keeping them safe from a
   murder of pesky crows that hovered above, drawn to the chirping
   ducklings.

   The mother duck kept a distance from the rescue team, quacking for her
   babies and fending off the crows as they swooped down and picked at
   her.

   Curious commuters and shoppers slowly descended upon the rescue
   mission, until there were about a dozen people watching the drama
   unfold.

   "I was heading into Price Chopper," said Vicky-Jo Demar, of Pittsfield.
   "I see small animals in trouble, and I'm on it."

   Two other ducklings that had walked through the sewer were rescued by
   removing another storm drain down the road. Besaw bought a fishing net
   from the nearby Five Below to scoop them out.

   The sixth and final duckling took the longest to rescue from the sewer
   -- about an hour. It walked even farther down the sewer, so a third
   sewer drain cover was removed for access.

   When Besaw netted the final duckling, people cheered. The duckling
   chirped.

   All six ducklings were reunited in the safety of the bushes for the
   mother duck -- who continued to quack nearby -- to retrieve.

   Besaw and Proctor said the rescue mission forged a friendship between
   the two strangers.

   "When it comes to animals, the good comes out of people," Besaw said.
   "I can't imagine if I lost my baby like that."
