Editorial: New blood at Metra

Put riders and taxpayers -- not the meddling politicians -- first

     * [127]print

     *
     *

   7:13 p.m. CDT, September 12, 2013

   For those of you keeping score at home: Two new Metra board members
   were approved this week, representing Kane and DuPage counties.
   Chicago's nominee awaits approval of the City Council. Two more members
   announced they'd be vacating their seats. Two other vacancies remain.

   A new commuter rail board is taking shape.

   New members, steel yourselves. This isn't a job for the faint of heart
   or weak of spine. The previous board -- including the handful of
   members still stubbornly rooted to their chairs -- has made a mess of
   things.

   The public doesn't trust Metra. Why should it? In the space of three
   years, Metra has been rocked by two enormously costly scandals. Former
   CEO Phil Pagano fleeced the rail system of $475,000 right under the
   noses of the Metra board. His successor, Alex Clifford, said "no" to
   patronage hiring and lost his job as a result. Clifford's bosses on the
   board tried to buy his silence with an $871,000 no-tell separation
   deal. But the truth came out.

   Set all of that against the backdrop of the largest fare hike in
   Metra's history and a dismal on-time performance rate, and you have
   some very unhappy customers. And taxpayers.

   All the bad publicity makes your immediate challenge -- finding a
   replacement for Clifford -- immeasurably difficult.

   Clifford thought he was hired to clean up Metra, but when he stood up
   to the meddling politicians, he was attacked by some board members and
   abandoned by the rest. Who wants to work at a place like that?

   The good news is that those back-to-back disasters provide the board
   with plenty of guidance on how to work with its next CEO.

   Pagano steamrolled a hands-off board. He made the decisions; his bosses
   rubber-stamped them. He violated board policies so brazenly and for so
   long that he believed he was untouchable. He finally went too far,
   forging the board president's signature on a memo to cover his tracks.
   He stepped in front of a train to avoid being fired.

   Clifford was supposed to be the anti-Pagano: ex-Marine, squeaky clean,
   everything by the book. Board members were happy to overlook the fact
   that he didn't have a railroad background, even though they had to hire
   a $337,000-a-year consultant to prop him up. Board members praised his
   performance while privately harboring concerns. That only added to the
   perception that he was ousted for speaking up.

   Board members, learn from those mistakes. Find and hire a top-shelf
   administrator. Provide support and oversight. Banish politicians from
   personnel and contract decisions. Focus on the riders.

   There's another decision you'll likely make quickly. You'll need to
   elect a chairman.

   Will County's Jack Partelow has been keeping the seat warm since
   Chairman Brad O'Halloran resigned in August. Clifford says O'Halloran
   pressured him to make personnel moves directed by Illinois House
   Speaker Michael Madigan -- and led the charge to get rid of him when he
   refused.

   Partelow should have followed O'Halloran out the door. He knew of
   Clifford's allegations but voted to keep them secret -- at taxpayer
   expense. A Regional Transportation Authority audit found the settlement
   agreement was "not fiscally prudent" and wasn't vetted rigorously by
   the Metra board.

   That deal was meant to protect the politicians, not the public, and the
   board members who approved it have no business hanging around. But
   three of them -- Partelow, Lake County's Norman Carlson and Cook
   County's Don DeGraff -- won't own up to their failure.

   The newcomers who will soon surround them need to set a different tone
   for Metra. They need to take charge of this board, and this agency. No
   more sitting around like potted plants while public money is pilfered
   and misspent behind the scenes. It's time to get Metra back on the
   rails.

   The new members have to hit the ground running. Those holdouts still
   need to hit the door.
