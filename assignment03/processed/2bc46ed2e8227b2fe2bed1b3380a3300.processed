Funeral bombing, other attacks kill at least 25 in Iraq

By Sameer N. Yacoub,

   BAGHDAD -- A suicide bomber attacked a funeral Saturday in northern
   Iraq attended by members of an ethnic minority, one of a string of
   attacks that left at least 25 people dead across the country, officials
   said.

   Iraq is weathering its deadliest bout of violence in half a decade,
   raising fears that the country is returning to a period of widespread
   killing like that which pushed it to the brink of civil war after the
   2003 United States-led invasion. More than 4,000 people have been
   killed in violent attacks since the start of April, including 804 in
   August, according to U.N. figures.

   The Sochi Games are being viewed as a battleground over the treatment
   of gays and respect for human rights.

   In the suicide attack, the bomber detonated his explosive belt inside a
   tent during the afternoon ceremony held by members of the Shabak
   minority in the village of Arto Kharab, near Mosul, 225 miles northwest
   of Baghdad.

   Authorities said the blast killed at least 20 people and wounded 35.
   The funeral was for a member of the Shabak minority who had died of
   natural causes, officials said.

   The Shabaks are ethnic Turkmens and Shiite Muslims. Most of them live
   in villages east of Mosul, the provincial capital of the ethnically
   mixed but predominantly Sunni Muslim province of Nineveh.

   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the funeral attack,
   but Mosul has been a hub for al-Qaeda in Iraq in past years. Militants
   have used violence and intimidation to drive hundreds of members of
   minority groups out of the city.

   Al-Qaeda's local branch, known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the
   Levant, has claimed responsibility for a number of large-scale bombings
   in recent months and is thought to be behind other coordinated attacks.

   The months-long surge of bloodshed is taking place against a backdrop
   of rising tensions between Iraq's Sunni and Shiite Muslims. The
   tensions are being inflamed in part by the sectarian divisions
   reflected in the civil war in neighboring Syria.

   In other violence Saturday, police said a roadside bomb hit a car in
   Dujail, a town just north of the capital, killing the driver and his
   wife. Police also said an 11-year-old boy was killed when a bomb hit a
   minibus traveling on a road near the town of Suleiman Beg, about 95
   miles northeast of Baghdad.

   Gunmen also stormed a tile factory in eastern Baghdad, killing the
   factory owner and a worker, police said.

   Officials in nearby hospitals confirmed the death tolls. All officials
   spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to
   talk to journalists.
