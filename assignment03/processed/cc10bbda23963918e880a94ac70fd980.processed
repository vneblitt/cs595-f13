Paul G. Haaga, Jr. Will Serve As Acting President & CEO of NPR

   September 13, 201312:12 PM

   NPR Names Paul G. Haaga, Jr. Acting President & CEO

   Board announces search for permanent successor; Approves Budget for
   Fiscal Year 2014

   September 13, 2013; Washington, D.C. â The Board of Directors of NPR
   announced today that Paul G. Haaga, Jr. will serve as Acting President
   & CEO of NPR effective September 30. Haaga has served on the Board
   since 2011, most recently as Vice Chair of the Board and Chair of its
   Finance Committee.

   "Paul has made many valuable contributions to NPR during his tenure on
   the Board," said Kit Jensen, Chair of the NPR Board and CEO of WVIZ/PBS
   & 90.3 WCPN Ideastream. "His intimate knowledge of our organization,
   his unwavering commitment to the highest quality of journalism and
   programming, and his financial acumen make him particularly well-suited
   to lead NPR as we begin our search for a permanent chief executive."

   Haaga said that his time on the Board has been "one of the most
   rewarding and exciting phases of my career." He continued: "I am
   thrilled to have the opportunity to lead one of the world's leading
   providers of news, music and cultural programming on an interim basis
   and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Board and
   senior leadership team to help this great organization build on its
   success."

   Haaga will succeed NPR President and CEO Gary E. Knell, who recently
   announced that he will leave the organization to become President and
   CEO of the National Geographic Society. NPR has appointed a search
   committee, co-chaired by Board members Florence Rogers, President and
   General Manager, Nevada Public Radio, and John Wotowicz, Managing
   Partner, Concentric Capital, to lead the search for a permanent CEO.

   The Board also approved a budget for fiscal year 2014 and a strategic
   roadmap to achieve a balanced budget over the next two years. The
   budget includes operating and investment revenues of $178.1 million,
   expenses of $183 million, and an operating cash deficit of $6.1
   million, or 3 percent of revenues. As part of the strategy to eliminate
   the deficit and lower ongoing expenses, NPR will offer a voluntary
   buyout plan broadly across the organization that seeks to reduce
   staffing levels by approximately 10 percent.

   Haaga has led an accomplished career. He is the retired chairman of the
   Board of Capital Research and Management Company, former chairman of
   the Investment Company Institute, and former partner in the law firm of
   Dechert Price & Rhoads in Washington. He served as a senior attorney
   for the Securities and Exchange Commission.

   His philanthropic leadership includes serving as chairman of the Board
   of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History; trustee of the
   Huntington Library, Museum and Gardens in San Marino, California;
   member of the Board of Overseers of the University of Pennsylvania Law
   School (Chairman 2007-2013); a trustee of Georgetown Preparatory
   School; a member of the National Council of the American Enterprise
   Institute; a member of the Board of Overseers of Hoover Institution at
   Stanford University; and a member of the Policy Circle at Pardee-Rand
   Graduate School. He and his wife Heather were among the founding group
   that started the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

   Haaga earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Princeton
   University, an M.B.A. from the Wharton School and a J.D. from the
   University of Pennsylvania Law School.
