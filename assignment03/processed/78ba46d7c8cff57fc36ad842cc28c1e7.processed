   ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: At the end of the episode, a young boy used a gun
   in a school shooting . It's one of the weapons Jax had the club give
   Nero's crew last season. You've wanted to do this story for years. Why,
   and why now?
   KURT SUTTER: As much as I don't want to do something because it is
   sensational, I also don't want to not do something because it might be
   perceived as sensational. My desire to do this story just felt very
   organic to the world: These guys deal guns, and there's a certain
   amount of disconnect once you put those guns out on the street not
   really knowing whose hands they're gonna end up in and what violence
   that they create. You sorta sell and move on, not unlike a drug dealer
   who doesn't really know the emotional impact of their product. And to
   have a father [Charlie Hunnam's Jax] who's struggling with boys of his
   own and questioning the violence of his life, and is this right for his
   kids -- it just seemed like a very organic story to tell. And I waited
   because I knew that ultimately the emotional and social impact would be
   great, that it would be hard to have that story happen and then move on
   to a couple seasons where these guys are selling guns and just livin'
   their life. I knew if we did it, it would really have to be at the end
   and, ultimately, I realized it was a good way to take us to the end.
   [Ed. note: Sutter expects the series to run seven seasons.] It's not
   being done arbitrarily. It ultimately becomes the final straw in their
   relationship with the gun business and the domino that takes us to a
   fairly tragic and epic conclusion. It impacts all their relationships:
   It impacts their relationship with the IRA, their relationship with
   local law enforcement, their relationship with other charters, and,
   more importantly, it really impacts their relationship with Charming,
   their hometown. Maybe they've lost their favorite sons status over the
   last four or five years, but they've never really been seen as a danger
   or as a pariah, and that really changes this season as a result of
   that.

   Tell me about the decision to make this young boy, the 11-year-old son
   of Nero's cousin's old lady, the shooter.
   Here's what I dig about we tend to do on this show:Â We have a lot of
   what I like to call epic absurdity on this show. It's really big and
   runs right up to that line of being fantastic. But then we tether it
   into some sense of reality and we always connect it. So what was almost
   like a throwaway line in terms of story in season 5 with Jax saying,
   "Look, let me just give your guys a few guns, it makes everybody happy"
   -- that innocent move that no one thinks is going to be bad -- is that
   little thread that comes back to bite them in the ass.Â Sometimes it's
   not the huge moves or machinations, it's just the simple moves that get
   us into trouble. Jax probably was not thinking through the consequences
   of what might happen with that. As far as the kid -- that was a bit of
   a risk. We don't do flashbacks on this show, but there was a part of me
   that said, maybe we can play with the audience a little bit: Do they
   think it's some sort of young Jax, or at least thematically, are we
   trying to say something? I think the interesting thing is people who
   see that on my show start to think, oh my god, what awful thing is
   gonna happen to this kid?Â You just assume because he's an innocent
   that he will ultimately be the victim of something, and then to flip it
   and have him be the perpetrator of the violence as a result of that
   perfect storm -- it's hopefully what will feel organic but also
   surprising to people.

   We don't do political stories on this show. This isn't about me making
   a political or social statement about gun violence and blah, blah,
   blah. So it was a difficult balance for me, because I didn't want the
   story line to become about that. And yet, I had to acknowledge some of
   it because if I didn't, it would feel irresponsible. So I tried to, as
   the season progresses, layer in enough of my point of view so there is
   some sense of responsibility in terms of the controversy but it doesn't
   become a narrative arc about gun violence. It ultimately stays about
   the impact it has emotionally on our characters. My point of view --
   and I still believe this -- is that one party is not responsible for
   those things. Meaning, in my opinion, it is the gun laws, it is the
   level of illegal guns that people can buy on the street, it is the
   issues we have with mental health, it is our education system, it is
   the responsibility and burden on the family. What we weave in
   organically, I think, is the sense that there are a myriad of
   circumstances that create this perfect storm, and ultimately, law
   enforcement needs to hang the responsibility on somebody. So it's the
   CCH Pounder character [District Attorney Tyne Patterson] that we
   introduce in episode 2. She is looking for the face of the devil to
   hang this crime on. But again, what I hope gets conveyed is the idea
   that there is not necessarily one party responsible for what happened
   with this kid.

   Let's back up and start from the beginning of the episode: Otto (played
   by Sutter), we learn, has been getting raped daily in prison at the
   request of Lee Toric (Donal Logue).
   You know, there's very few showrunners who will take one in the ass for
   his show -- I just want to say that publicly, and you can quote me on
   that. I think it's my ongoing devastation of Otto. Toric's sort of
   reaching for anything he can get at this point. Otto is the guy that is
   directly responsible for the death of his sister. It remains
   unpleasant.

   Lyla (Winter Ave Zoli), bruised and burnt from a shoot she didn't know
   would be torture porn, crying "Please, oh god, I want Opie" to Jax --
   it just about made me burst into tears.
   Like I said when we killed Ryan [Hurst's] character, his ghost really
   is hanging around. It impacts Jax and it impacts other people, and
   Lyla, in that moment of devastation, wishes that she had her hero to
   protect her. I think it's the motivation that Jax needs to go and
   really f-- these guys up. Look, there's not gonna be any scenes where
   Jax is at Opie's graveside talking to him. We're not that show. But I
   do think the emotional weight of Opie will continue to be referenced
   throughout this season. There's a few times where Jax talks about the
   loss of a brother and the impact of that. We will, if not consciously,
   at least unconsciously, have a sense that it's what's pushing him along
   and it's the reason why he's perhaps not ready to abandon anything
   because if he did, what Opie did would be in vain.

   Jax told Tig (Kim Coates) to set the Iranian porn producer they'd caged
   free, but the guy made an ill-timed comment about Tig's daughter and
   Tig killed him -- by drowning him in a urine-filled tub, which Tig then
   took a piss in.
   Too much? [Laughs]

   I'd say right at the line.
   Yeah. It was one of those moments where I was writing, and suddenly I
   was like, Ohmygod, Tig's pissing on his head. Okay. [Laughs] I feel
   like we couldn't have that story unravel without it having some
   emotional impact on Tig and the horrible thing that he saw happen to
   his kid. That does come back, and perhaps does not end well for Tig as
   a result of that. For me, it's acknowledging that even the legitimate
   business that these guys are in -- porn -- is all, like, f--in' fringe
   stuff. It's a fraction off of being illicit and bad. Fetish porn is
   okay, but torture porn is not okay. Not that I should be the arbiter of
   where that line is drawn [Laughs], but you know what I mean. Really, is
   anybody in that club capable of drawing a moral boundary at this point?
   [Laughs]

   In order for Chibs (Tommy Flanagan) to get right with Juice (Theo
   Rossi) still being in the club, Chibs beat the crap out of him at the
   garage. It was a tough scene for us to watch and one that Gemma (Katey
   Sagal) saw and didn't try to stop. She knew it had to happen.
   It's interesting, that scene was actually in the finale of last year. I
   think we shot it in Clay's house after the arrest, but it felt like way
   too much happening to Juice at the end of last season. I didn't put it
   in the finale cut because it didn't feel right. I wasn't quite sure
   why, but as the premiere shaped up, I was like, Oh, that's why, because
   now it's about Chibs finding out that Jax is sort of giving Juice this
   pardon and Jax isn't saying why, and Chibs ultimately has to get right
   with it himself and is gonna do it by doing what these guys do. It's
   their own form of justice, their own form of flogging. And we have
   Juice ultimately just f--in' suckin' it up and takin' it. If Juice and
   Chibs were going at it and fighting together, Gemma may have, at that
   point, tried to intervene. But what she saw was clearly a beat-down and
   Juice knew he deserved it, so I think in Gemma's mind, she understood
   this is something that had to go down and both parties are aware of it,
   so she was gonna let it happen.

   Jax cheated on Tara (Maggie Siff) with Colette (Kim Dickens), a madame
   who wants to legitimize her brothel by teaming up with Diosa. I was
   yelling at my TV as he walked up those stairs.
   For me, and I think this is communicated, there's a disconnect that Jax
   feels with Tara. And Jax has that weird connection with his mom. I
   think Jax is a guy that needs a strong woman in his life. In fact, I
   think at some point this season, Bobby [Mark Boone Junior] says that to
   Tara. So the connection Jax has to Colette -- not that I want to
   suggest that it's incestuous -- but there's just something sweet, and
   gentle, and maternal about her energy. Like, when he's watching her
   make the bed, and she's taking off his shoes. She's an older woman.
   There's just something incredibly nurturing about her energy that
   perhaps he hasn't been getting from Tara or he's missing from that
   relationship. So for me, it was more about that. There's a different
   need going on there. It's not lust as much as it is emotional. I never
   intended it to be some love triangle thing. For better or for worse,
   it's just part of how these guys live. Not that that makes it okay. It
   ultimately becomes a professional complication for Jax as they get into
   business together.

   Tara delivered her own beat-down to a woman who stole her blanket in
   jail.
   There's a big shift, obviously, with Tara this season. We watch the
   education continue. I think the emotional impact of her going to jail
   does not land lightly. [Ed. note: MAJOR SPOILER ALERT! Skip the rest of
   this paragraph if you haven't seen Orange is the New Black.] It's
   funny, my wife [Katey Sagal] has been watching Orange is the New Black.
   I've not watched the whole season, but I came in, and it's such a great
   show, and I watched a couple sporadic episodes, and then I watched the
   finale where they end the season with the main character having this
   emotional shift and beating somebody down. I thought, well, that's the
   difference between me and Jenji Kohan [creator of OITNB]: she ends her
   season with the beat-down and I begin my season with a beat-down.
   [Laughs]

   But for me, that was about Tara being in this really different
   emotional place and perhaps a little disconnected. It's like the
   education of her becoming an old lady is ultimately not what Jax fell
   in love with. You know what I mean? He fell in love with the sweet,
   nurturing innocence of who she was, and yet, to be his old lady, she
   has to become something else that ultimately may be not what he wanted.
   So it's the contradiction of okay, now I'm beatin' the s-- out of
   somebody, and now you are going back to somebody who is nurturing and
   maternal. I've become what I needed to become to be your old lady, and
   now that's not what you want.

   We have to talk about Lee Toric naked in front of the mirror. You get
   Donal Logue to do some amazing things this season.
   [Laughs] That was my homage to Apocalypse Now, my homage to the Martin
   Sheen scene. Donal is so f--ing great, he just goes there. He's like,
   "Yeah! That's awesome! I'll just be naked." It's like, "Okay. Knock
   yourself out, brother." Toric has got some demons. We set it up last
   season that he obviously has these medical issues, and whether or not
   we ever reveal specifcally what those are, we'll see. But he's a guy
   that perhaps has his own ticking clock, and perhaps that's part of
   what's motivating his obsessive need for finding justice or his brand
   of justice.

   In the end, Clay (Ron Perlman) decided to give the guard Toric's card
   rather than enter gen pop where he knew he'd be killed. He said he
   wanted a deal.
   I don't want to reveal which way it's going, but what I think is
   interesting is, if anybody is a match for Toric, it's Clay. Clay is a
   guy who's been around the longest, and has seen guys like Toric, and
   knows that dance. So it's not much of a chess match with Toric and
   Tara, but it's an interesting chess match with Toric and Clay.

   This premiere was relentless. I've seen episodes 2 and 3, and they slow
   down a bit. It's almost like a depression sets in with the weight of
   all the things the characters are dealing with. Was that change in pace
   you knowing fans would need a chance to catch their breath or simply
   what the story dictated?
   I think a little bit of both. I think organically, it's what's going
   on, and that will continue to happen this season. It's sort of like at
   some point, the speed and the aggressiveness that these guys perpetrate
   will ultimately have to slow down. But I also think this season they're
   forced to be a little bit more reflective because of what's happened.
   It's funny, I had a conversation with [exec producer/director] Paris
   Barclay going into episode 9, and I said, "This is an episode where we
   have probably more scenes of two people just talking to each other than
   we've ever done before." And it wasn't like I started out the episode
   saying, "Let's do that." It's just the nature of where it's going. Not
   that we don't continue to be driven with action, because that's what
   the show is and that's never gonna really change. But I do think it
   does slow down a little bit. I think it's why the episodes are so much
   longer [and many will run over an hour]: We still have those
   components, but it's hard for those things to happen now and not result
   in other scenes about the impact of those things.

   In the first few seasons, we could have stuff happen, and because it
   was the first time it was happening with a certain amount of people,
   you didn't have to worry about where it was going. And now, when you
   come back around and you're dealing with those same people and same
   relationships, and their mythology is deeper and their relationships
   are thicker, you have more story to tell. You have to reveal more, so
   it just becomes much more complex. Interestingly enough, I think the
   same thing happened to us on The Shield -- as the seasons progressed,
   not that we didn't have action, but Vic [Michael Chiklis] became much
   more reflective, as did the other characters, because there was so much
   more history to play. You couldn't ignore the four or five seasons of
   history that happened that the audience has shared with you. By the
   nature of the mythology growing, it's forced to expand.
