Frequently Asked Questions
The Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda

What are the Millennium Development Goals?

   The eight [36]Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - which range from
   halving extreme poverty to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing
   universal primary education, all by the target date of 2015 - were
   adopted by UN Member States in 2000. The MDGs have been the most
   successful global anti-poverty push in history. They have made a huge
   difference, helping to set global and national priorities and fuel
   action on the ground, raising awareness and shaping a broad vision that
   remains the overarching framework for development work across the
   world. MDG targets for reducing poverty, improving access to safe
   drinking water, and improving the lives of 200 million slum dwellers
   have been met. More kids than ever are attending primary school with
   parity between boys and girls. Child deaths have dropped dramatically,
   and targeted investments in fighting malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis
   have saved millions of lives.

What will happen after 2015 - the target date for the Millennium Development
Goals?

   With strong leadership and accountability to meet commitments, the
   progress seen in implementing the MDGs can be accelerated and expanded
   in most of the world's countries, and more MDG targets can be met by
   2015. The progress that is made towards the MDG targets today will
   translate into improving more lives, now and under future development
   objectives. Therefore, accelerating MDG progress and preparing for the
   post-2015 UN development framework are part of the same effort.

   Looking beyond the MDGs, much remains to be done to build the future we
   want. Continuing gaps - on poverty, hunger, health, gender equality,
   water, sanitation and many other issues - will still need attention
   after 2015. The UN sustainable development agenda for the period after
   2015 will build on the progress achieved through the MDGs while
   addressing persistent inequalities and new challenges facing people and
   the planet.

What will the post-2015 agenda look like?

   The new development agenda will need to advance sustainable
   development--improving economic and social well-being while protecting
   the environment. -- and address issues including inclusive growth,
   equality, peace and security, governance and human rights. It must be
   bold, ambitious and universal - relevant to all people and all
   societies, everywhere. It must constitute global transformational
   change for people and planet, with common, shared responsibilities for
   all countries, recognizing that countries have different capabilities.
   It will draw on experience gained in implementing the MDGs - both in
   terms of results achieved and areas for improvement. The agenda must be
   concrete, understandable and inspirational, with time-bound targets,
   for which measurable indicators can be developed.

How will the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were mandated by the
outcome of the Rio+20 conference fit into the post-2015 sustainable
development framework?

   In the outcome document for the Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable
   Development (Rio de Janeiro, June 2012)  entitled "The Future We Want,"
   countries recognized the success of the MDGs in galvanizing action to
   eradicate poverty and promote human development. They agreed to build
   on the success of the MDGs by developing a set of sustainable
   development goals that are global in nature and universally
   applicable.  Since Rio+20, the UN General Assembly has established a
   30-member [37]Open Working Group to develop these goals, and this work
   is now ongoing.  Member States will also discuss strategy for financing
   sustainable development and consider options for improved sharing of
   technology, as a contribution to the post-2015 framework.  In September
   2013, Member States are expected to agree on a roadmap to integrate all
   these complementary strands with ongoing efforts to accelerate and
   review progress towards the achievement of the MDGs.

What was the Secretary-General's High-level Panel?

   The UN [38]Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Post-2015 was formed
   in July 2012 with 27 members, including government leaders and
   representatives from civil society and the private sector. It was
   tasked with advising the Secretary-General on the future development
   agenda. The Panel produced a bold yet practical development vision
   which has been presented to the Secretary-General as one input to his
   report on the ongoing work on MDG acceleration and post-2015 to be
   considered by UN Member States in September 2013. The Panel's report
   was also presented to all Member States in the General Assembly, and to
   the Open Working Group on the sustainable development goals.

   At the core of the Panel's proposals are five transformational shifts.
   The new agenda must include everyone. It requires us to put sustainable
   development at its core in order to drive prosperity and eliminate
   inequalities while addressing threats to humanity from climate change
   and environmental degradation. It makes creating jobs and sustainable
   livelihoods a priority. It establishes that peace, security and freedom
   from violence are essential. And it calls for forging a new global
   partnership to support this transformative agenda.

What is the consultation process for creating the post-2015 sustainable
development agenda?

   Work to develop a post-2015 sustainable development agenda has begun
   through an open and inclusive process involving Governments, the
   private sector, civil society groups, academics and youth. Worldwide
   consultations involving nearly one million people have been completed,
   including some 90 national consultations and 11 global thematic
   consultations. An online platform -[39] The World We Want 2015 - has
   connected people in a global conversation, while [40]MY World, a survey
   seeking opinions on the issues that matter most, has received over half
   a million votes in over 190 countries.. These inputs from civil society
   were presented to the High-level Panel on Post-2015 and will also
   inform the Secretary-General's report to UN Member States in September
   2013. In addition, they will be used by the UN System in preparing
   inputs to the deliberations of the 30-member Open Working Group
   established by the UN General Assembly to develop a set of sustainable
   development goals.

What is the Sustainable Development Solutions Network?

   Launched by the UN Secretary-General, the [41]Sustainable Development
   Solutions Network draws on academic and technical expertise worldwide
   to support the UN development framework by identifying pathways to
   address the challenges of ending poverty, increasing social inclusion
   and achieving sustainable development. The Network, directed by
   Professor Jeffrey Sachs, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on
   the MDGs, launched its report on 6 June 2013 and will continue to
   promote viable solutions that can be implemented on the ground.

What is the timeline for establishing the sustainable development agenda?

   The sustainable development agenda will need to be ready to be put into
   action as soon as we reach the target date for the MDGs in 2015, thus
   enabling a seamless transition. Several processes are already ongoing
   which will feed into the process. Following the results of worldwide
   consultations, the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Agenda submitted
   its report to the Secretary-General in May 2013. The UN Development
   Group, UN Global Compact and Sustainable Development Solutions Network
   have also provided reports that will inform the Secretary-General's
   recommendations to Member States for consideration in September 2013.
   The 30-member Open Working Group, established by the UN General
   Assembly, is developing a proposal for sustainable development goals,
   and Member States are discussing a strategy for financing sustainable
   development and considering options for improved sharing of technology,
   as a contribution to the post-2015 agenda.

   At a [42]Special Event on the MDGs to be held by the President of the
   UN General Assembly in September 2013, it is expected that a report of
   the Secretary-General to UN Member States will inform some preliminary
   decisions towards shaping the post-2015 agenda. The Secretary-General
   and the UN System will continue to support UN Member States over the
   course of the coming two years as deliberations continue on agreeing
   and finalizing a new sustainable development agenda.
