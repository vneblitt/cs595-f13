The Irreparable Damage of the Political Attacks on Women in Texas

   By [37]Yvonne Gutierrez | August 22, 2013 | 12:56 PM | [38]Comments

   Tags: [40]Texas, [41]Texas Bus Tour, [42]Texas women's health

   This year's legislative session in Texas turned out to be a nightmare
   for women across the state.  Unfortunately, it's been a recurring
   nightmare. I was in Austin witnessing the latest attacks and the
   devastating culmination of years of attacks on women's health. I was at
   the capitol for the passing of House Bill 2 (HB2), which contains
   restrictions that would turnback the clock on Texas women's health. The
   bill, which is now law, will virtually ban abortion in much of the
   state. And the women who have been hurt the most by these bills are
   low-income and Latina women.

   HB2 makes a terrible situation for women's health even worse. This new
   law will severely limit access to safe and legal abortion in Texas,
   which may cause women to resort to desperate and dangerous measures.
   These relentless attacks on women's health have a devastating impact on
   women who already have the least access to health care, such as
   Latinas. Latinas face greater obstacles to obtaining, and benefiting
   from, sexual and reproductive health services than non-Latino white
   Americans. As a result, Latinas experience higher rates of reproductive
   cancers, unintended pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections than
   most other groups of people.

   During regular and special sessions, the legislature ignored the deeply
   personal, moving testimony of hundreds of women who came to the capitol
   from all parts of Texas to tell their stories.  They ignored the words
   of doctors and medical professionals who stood against this outrageous
   attack on women's health. They ignored the wishes of Texans, 80 percent
   of whom said they did not want this bill. And despite the courageous
   11-hour people's filibuster, led by State Senator Wendy Davis, they
   pressed for a third special session and finally passed this terrible
   bill.

   And this is just the tip of the iceberg: There's a health care crisis
   faced by women in Texas, where one in four women are uninsured. An
   estimated 130,000 women are going without basic, preventive health care
   due to the 2011 Texas Legislature's drastic cuts to women's health care
   funding, and tens of thousands more may be losing access to health care
   since Governor Rick Perry has also banned Planned Parenthood from the
   state Women's Health Program (WHP). Planned Parenthood health centers
   in Texas were critical to the success of this program, providing
   lifesaving cancer screenings, well-woman exams, contraception,
   screening for diabetes and high blood pressure, and testing for
   sexually transmitted infections. The WHP was an essential program for
   Latinas, since Latinas have the third highest death rates from cervical
   cancer and higher rates of HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia; and now
   without Planned Parenthood in the program, they may be left without
   access to preventive health care.

   People are enraged by these relentless attacks and this moment is about
   us. It's about what we have seen happen in the past years. It's about
   thousands of people across the country shouting, "ENOUGH!" And I know,
   without a doubt, that those fighting for women's health aren't going
   anywhere.

   Yvonne was a key participant in the 2013 Latino State of the State in
   Texas hosted by MALDEF on August 15th in San Antonio, TX.  This forum
   brought together select community leaders to discuss the true state of
   Latino life in Texas.
