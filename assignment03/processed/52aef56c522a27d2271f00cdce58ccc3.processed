[27]Lack of sleep boosts food purchases the next day

   Savvy shoppers know that it's a bad idea to shop for food when they are
   hungry. It's a formula for filling your cart with high calorie foods,
   and likely spending more money than expected. Shopping while sleep
   deprived may have the same effect.

   That finding comes from an interesting experiment done by a team of
   Swedish researchers. They asked 14 men to go grocery shopping
   twice--once on the morning after a good night's sleep, the other on a
   morning after a night of no sleep. All were given the equivalent of $50
   to spend, and were asked to buy as much as they could out of a possible
   40 items, including 20 high-caloric foods and 20 low-caloric foods. To
   make sure the men weren't hungry, they were fed a solid breakfast
   before grocery shopping.

   The men bought more food, and more high-calorie foods, the morning
   after sleep deprivation than after sleeping well. The results were
   [29]published yesterday online in the journal Obesity.

   We've known for some time that not getting enough sleep is linked to
   weight gain. It's possible that shopping may contribute to this
   phenomenon. Lack of sleep may contribute to weight gain via other
   possible mechanisms. Too little sleep may
     * slow metabolism
     * prompt cells to store carbohydrates as fat rather than use it for
       energy or burn it off as heat
     * cause cells to not respond as well as they should to insulin. That
       increases the level of sugar and insulin in the bloodstream, which
       can lead to weight gain.
     * lower levels of leptin, a hormone that suppresses appetite, and
       increase levels of ghrelin (GRELL-in), an appetite-stimulating
       hormone.

   It's interesting that the researchers chose men rather than women for
   this experiment. Perhaps in Sweden, where the study was done, men do
   more of the grocery shopping. In the United States, we certainly need
   to see if the results will be the same in women.

Putting it into practice

   For years, research on weight gain and obesity has focused on genes,
   foods, diets, and physical activity (or the lack of it). This study
   from Sweden, along with many others, are showing that our behaviors
   also play important roles in weight maintenance and weight gain. A good
   example of this work is the research conducted by Cornell University's
   Brian Wansink and colleagues on [30]"mindless eating."

   You can put the Swedish study into practice today. Be aware of how your
   body responds when you don't get enough sleep. Whenever possible, shop
   for food only on days when you've gotten at least seven hours of
   sleep--and don't go to the grocery store hungry. And when you know you
   are sleep deprived and tired, focus on [31]mindful eating even more
   than usual.

       But, whether by staying up late and just eat a snack will increase
       obesity?
