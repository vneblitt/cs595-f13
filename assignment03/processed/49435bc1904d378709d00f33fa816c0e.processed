   The Oct. 1 launch of the new [34]health insurance exchanges is now less
   than two months away, and people are starting to pay attention to the
   changes these new marketplaces may bring to the nation's health care
   system.

   We know it's confusing, so we're spending part of the summer and fall
   answering at least some of your questions about the law. You can see
   earlier pieces in our series [35]here and [36]here.

   Today we're answering questions regarding two of the more frequent
   topics raised: student health plans and possible penalties for failing
   to obtain health insurance.

   "I started going to graduate school two years ago, and ... someone like
   me who is older, I don't have any resources as much as a working person
   my age, so I was wondering what happens with those people while they
   are in school?"

   -- Carolina Trabuco, Eugene, Ore.

   "I heard that folks can opt out of employer-based insurance programs if
   it's cost prohibitive, and I was wondering how that works for graduate
   students because we are required to get insurance either through our
   school or on the market â can't go through the state. I'm wondering
   what the options are if the school insurance is cost prohibitive?"

   â Rebecca Kahn, Somerville, Mass.

What To Know Now

   Checking out options in coverage under the new health care law means
   getting up to speed on key ideas.

   Students And The Affordable Care Act.
     * Insurance offered through a college or university satisfies the
       individual mandate.
     * For those students who can't afford insurance: If your state has
       expanded Medicaid and you earn about $15,000 or less, you can
       qualify for this government health insurance program.
     * Students who are not fully employed and earn less than $10,000 a
       year do not have to sign up for health insurance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Penalties.

   The government will assess a penalty for not having health insurance.
   But for the next year, it won't be much: $95 or 1 percent of your
   taxable income will be fined. In later years, though, the penalty will
   increase.

   The first thing students need to know is that if they DO have student
   insurance through their college or university, that's been [39]deemed
   to satisfy the requirement that individuals have health insurance
   starting in 2014. There was a question about that for a while, and it's
   been answered.

   Then there's the question of what happens if you can't afford the
   insurance your school offers or what to do if your school doesn't offer
   coverage.

   First, if you're a full-time student and you're not working, or if
   you're working just part-time, you probably don't earn enough to
   trigger the requirement to have health insurance. It applies only to
   people who [40]earn enough to have to file income taxes; that's just
   under $10,000 this year for a single person under age 65.

   What if you DO want health insurance? One popular part of the law lets
   [41]young adults stay on their parents' health insurance plans until
   they turn 26. And in states that opt to expand Medicaid, that's an
   option for college and graduate students that hasn't been available
   before. It's for people who earn up to 133 percent of poverty, or about
   [42]$15,000 a year for an individual. But so far [43]only about half
   the states are planning to expand Medicaid.

   Another issue that sparked a lot of interest was the possibility of
   penalties for NOT having health insurance.

   "You said if you had to spend more than 8 percent of your income on
   premiums, then you get a waiver on the penalty. Is that for a whole
   family? Is it for individuals? Or is it on gross or net income? When is
   it going to be assessed? ... If you can't or don't want to buy
   insurance for some reason, might the penalty actually be less than a
   yearly premium?"

   -- Erin Molnar, Ferndale, Mich.

   "If you drive without a license, really nobody knows about it until you
   get caught. There are people who do live under the radar, so to speak.
   So if you're this person who's choosing deliberately not to get a
   health insurance policy, how does the government find you? Where do
   they look?"

   -- Kathleen Orth, Alpena, Mich.

The Continuing Story Of The Affordable Care Act

   [48]You Ask, We Answer: Demystifying The Affordable Care Act July 1,
   2013

   The penalty for not having health insurance is, at least for 2014, is
   $95 or 1 percent of your taxable income â whichever is greater. It
   [49]does go up in later years, eventually to a maximum of 2.5 percent
   of taxable income.

   It's assessed, if you owe it, on your 2014 income tax form that's due
   April 15, 2015. And that's how the government finds you â it asks on
   your income tax form if you had health insurance. People who have it
   will get some sort of certificate of coverage from their health
   insurers. And a reminder â you can't go to jail for not paying the
   penalty; the government can't even garnish your wages. The most the IRS
   can do is withhold your tax refund. See the answer to the last question
   in this [50]IRS fact sheet.

   And one final, penalty-related question:

   "If both husband and wife work for separate companies, and both
   companies offer health insurance, is there a penalty if one obtains
   health insurance under the other's policy?"

   -- Louis Tortorelli, Churchill, Tenn.

   m%2Ftracks%2F104561245&color=ff6600&auto_play=false&show_artwork=false

   It depends on how you define the word penalty. Seriously.

   From the government â no. To reiterate, pretty much all employer
   insurance counts as coverage for purposes [52]of fulfilling the
   insurance requirement. Take your own, take your spouse's. It doesn't
   matter.

   Some companies, however, (and this is something that pre-dates the
   Affordable Care Act) [53]impose a penalty if an employee's spouse (who
   doesn't work for the same firm) has coverage available from his or her
   own job. The theory is that the company doesn't want to be providing
   benefits to another company's employee. But however you make the
   calculation that's best for your family, it doesn't matter for purposes
   of the health law.
