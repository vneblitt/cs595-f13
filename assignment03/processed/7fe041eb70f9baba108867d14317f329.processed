   A construction worker dies in the Englewood neighborhood after being
   trapped in paving machine. (WGN-TV)
   Staff report

   9:35 p.m. CDT, September 12, 2013

   A worker has died after becoming trapped underneath a pavement
   recycling machine in the Englewood neighborhood on the South Side,
   officials said.
   The accident occurred around 12:45 p.m. in the 6200 block of South May
   Street, according to Police News Affairs Officer John Mirabelli. The
   man was identified as Martin Marino, 48, of an undetermined address,
   according to the Cook County medical exmainer's office.

   The man, believed to be age 48, was trapped underneath an
   asphalt-grinding machine, and was dead at the scene, according to the
   Chicago Fire Department's news office.

   Officials said the worker somehow became trapped under the machine and
   died on the scene. Workers were able to free the man's body by a little
   before 2:30 p.m. and his body was taken to the Cook County morgue, said
   Chicago Fire Department spokesman Chief Joe Roccasalva.

   The man apparently worked for a paving company, Mirabelli said.
   The man was a worker for a contractor for Peoples Gas doing paving
   after the completion of a project by Peoples, said Peoples spokeswoman
   Jennifer Block.

   The asphalt-grinding machine was marked as belonging to G.A. Paving Co.
   of Bellwood.

   The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration had an
   investigator on scene, spokesman Scott Allen said.
