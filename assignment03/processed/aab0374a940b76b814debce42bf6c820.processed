   "What I love most about NPR is learning about different cultures, food,
   music and people's stories from around the world. I get a connection to
   experiences that I would not have otherwise. So until I can get around
   the globe and witness for myself, it's all about NPR," said Vidhya
   Nagarajan, who contributed this art for the 2014 NPR Wall Calendar.

   In addition to being a fabulous illustrator, Nagarajan is also a
   fabulous public radio listener, tuning in to KWMU St. Louis and NPR
   Podcasts. See more of her work online, at [28]@vidtheeya.

   Every year, we ask artists and illustrators to channel their NPR
   listening (and love) into art for the NPR Wall Calendar, and we're
   sharing these designs with you. The [29]2014 NPR Wall Calendar is
   available for purchase in the [30]NPR Shop at [31]shop.npr.org.
