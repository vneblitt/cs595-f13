'Day of honor': Afghans take over national security from US-led forces

   A deadly explosion in Kabul claimed three lives and injured dozens
   while, in another part of the city, US-led NATO troops handed control
   to Afghanistan's local forces. NBCNews.com's Dara Brown reports.

   KABUL, Afghanistan - U.S.-led troops handed complete control of
   security to Afghanistan authorities Tuesday - an act of faith in
   country's fledgling police and army in the face of near-constant
   insurgent attacks.

   The formal transfer of responsibility is major milestone in the process
   of withdrawal from the country, 12 years after [64]NATO-led mission
   ISAF began its mission to end Taliban rule.

   However, a botched car bomb that killed at least three civilians just
   before the official handover ceremony raising renewed questions about
   how the country's 352,000-strong security forces will tackle the
   militant threat.

   Most foreign combat troops will leave the country by the end of 2014,
   but international funding and humanitarian aid will continue -
   prolonging the political headache for President Barack Obama over
   America's involvement in the conflict.

   "Today is a day for all Americans to take pride in the hard work our
   service members and their civilian counterparts are performing every
   day in Afghanistan," Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a statement
   that called Tuesday's handover a "critical milestone."

   Ordinary Afghans may be harder to convince.

   "It is a good decision that the Afghan forces are taking the
   responsibility because it is their own country and they are the one who
   should be responsible for the security," said Kabul restaurant owner
   Mohammad Faried, adding: "I still have doubts. If they do not have good
   weapons it will be hard for them to keep peace and stability in the
   country especially in the villages."

   Afghan President Hamid Karzai, left, shakes hands with NATO
   Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen prior to Tuesday's ceremony in
   Kabul.

   The U.S. and its allies have yet to decide exactly how long troops will
   remain in Afghanistan beyond 2014, and what their role should be.

   Earlier this month, retired four-star general John Allen [67]called on
   the U.S. to keep a larger force in Afghanistan than the 8,000-12,000
   reportedly being considered by U.S. officials.

   Among the problems is a high desertion rate in local police forces,
   meaning thousands of new recruits are needed each month.

   A Congressional [68]research report published in April said the Obama
   administration was also concerned that "weak and corrupt governance" in
   Afghanistan would hamper the fight against the Taliban.

   In additional The Afghan army has suffered a sharp rise in casualties
   since it began slowly assuming greater control of security, [69]the BBC
   reported.  By comparison, international coalition casualties have been
   steadily falling since 2010, it said.

   Afghans are now responsible for security in all districts of
   Afghanistan's 34 provinces, completing a transfer of power from NATO
   that began in 2011.

   "Is a great day for us, not only for the Afghan government but also for
   the Afghan nation," said Janan Mosazai, spokesperson for the country's
   ministry of foreign affairs. "It is a big day of honor."

   The U.S. military is by far the single biggest group within ISAF's
   steadily-shrinking force of about 100,000 foreign troops [[70]PDF link
   here.]

   The security handover means the remaining US-led forces will play only
   a supporting role, providing help if needed but no longer taking the
   lead in tackling insurgent attacks.

   "We will continue to help Afghan troops in operations if needed," NATO
   Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said at Tuesday's ceremony.
   "But we will no longer plan, execute or lead those operations. And by
   the end of 2014, our combat mission will be completed. At that time,
   Afghanistan will be fully secured by Afghans."

   As combat troops are scaled down, the U.S. focus will shift to Special
   Operations forces who will advise the Afghan military on hunting down
   top insurgent or terrorist leaders.

   On any day in Afghanistan, about 60 Special Operations teams are
   working with Afghan local police forces to provide security in
   villages, [73]according to a New York Times report.

   The target of Tuesday's suicide car bomb attack was prominent lawmaker
   and Shia Muslim cleric Mohammed Mohaqiq, police at the scene told The
   Associated Press.

   More than ten years after the beginning of the war, Afghanistan faces
   external pressure to reform as well as ongoing internal conflicts.

   Gen. Mohammad Zahir, chief of the Kabul Criminal Investigation
   Division, told the AP three people were killed by the bombing and
   another 30 were wounded -- including six bodyguards. Mohaqiq survived
   the attack, Reuters reported.

   In March, [76]Karzai publicly criticized the American presence in his
   country, causing embarrassment to U.S. defense secretary, Chuck Hagel,
   during his first visit to Kabul in the new role.
