   Students walk across campus after a recent snowfall Virginia Tech will
   offer winter session beginning with the 2013-14 academic year. Students
   can choose from on-campus, online, hybrid courses, or education abroad
   experiences to earn credits toward their degree between the fall and
   spring semesters.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., Aug. 19, 2013 - Students have more academic offerings
   for the 2013-14 academic year, with the addition of a new academic
   special sessions, majors, minors, programs, and learning spaces.

Winter Session

     * For the first time, during what has traditionally been just winter
       break, the university will offer a new academic special session,
       similar to summer sessions, helping students make progress toward
       their degrees more quickly.
     * Virginia Tech currently enrolled students as well as visiting
       students can choose from a variety of courses to fulfill Curriculum
       for Liberal Education or major/minor requirements, or to explore
       another area of interest.
     * Courses will be delivered in multiple formats, from entirely
       online, in residence, a blended format with online and face-to-face
       interactions, and specialized education abroad opportunities.
     * The university will remain closed Dec. 24, 2013 through Jan. 1,
       2014. Look for an in-depth article on winter session this
       fall through Virginia Tech News.

New Undergraduate Degrees

     * A [160]new bachelor's degree program in real estate launches for
       fall 2013. The innovative degree will transcend traditional college
       boundaries as a comprehensive, inter-college academic program that
       will be a partnership among six colleges.
     * A [161]new major in environmental informatics, based in the
       Department of Forest Resources and Conservation in the College of
       Natural Resources and Environment, begins in fall 2013. The
       [162]major brings together information technology, data analysis,
       natural resources, geospatial science, and ecological modeling.
     * In the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, students have a
       new foreign language major - Russian. The language concentration
       previously was offered only as a minor.

New Graduate Degrees

     * The nuclear engineering program in the College of Engineering
       offers [163]master and doctoral degree programs starting in fall
       2013. In 2007, the program was revived with a master's degree in
       mechanical engineering with a nuclear certificate. The new degree
       programs are a reflection of Virginia Tech's dedication to
       educational programs and research in production and delivery of
       energy.

New Undergraduate Minors

     * A [164]minor in biomedical engineering in the College of
       Engineering is open for students. About 50 students will be
       accepted into the program each semester, with a cap of around 250
       students at a given time. Students must be sophomore or higher to
       enter the program.
     * The College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences is unrolling several
       new minors: diversity and community engagement, [165]peace studies
       and violence prevention, and [166]communication.
     * The management department in the Pamplin College of Business offers
       a new minor in entrepreneurship in the area of new venture growth.

New Focus Options within Majors

     * The building construction major in the College of Architecture and
       Urban Studies has four new degree options: design; sustainable
       building performance and energy management; building information
       technology and management; and real estate as a dual major. All
       degrees have three semester of common core study before moving into
       specialized courses for each option.
     * Political science majors in the College of Liberal Arts and Human
       Sciences have a new focus option in [167]national security studies.
     * [168]Management majors in the Pamplin College of Business have a
       new focus option in management consulting and analysis,
       complementing the two established options in human resource
       management and entrepreneurship, innovation, and technology
       management.

Living-learning Community

     * Budding entrepreneurs have a new place to collaborate - the
       [169]"Innovate" living-learning community. At a house at 2475 Oak
       Lane, 35 students will immerse themselves in the many facets of
       entrepreneurship. While a faculty director from Pamplin College of
       Business will lead the community, it is open to students of all
       majors to apply.

Certificate Program in the National Capital Region

     * The School of Public and International Affairs is developing a
       [170]Living Lab certificate program utilizing Virginia Tech's
       partnership with local government and industry in the [171]National
       Capital Region. Students will be immersed in the operational
       systems that sustain a thriving metropolis and mentored by Virginia
       Tech faculty and professionals while employing the nation's capital
       as their personal laboratory. The program's launch is targeted for
       spring of 2014, with a pilot program in fall 2013. Interested
       students should contact [172]Anne Khademian or [173]Andrea Morris.

Academic Spaces

     * Five laboratories on the first floor of Derring Hall that are used
       for first year biology labs are renovated. The rooms are refitted
       with new lab furniture, technology, and other upgrades.
     * The library also has some new spaces to explore.
          + The College of Science and University Libraries collaborated
            on a [174]new SCALE-UP classroom in 100 Newman Library. When
            classes are not in session, students are welcome to use the
            space, which boasts eight large screen displays and
            wall-to-wall white boards.
          + There is a new room called [175]Port: Digital Research
            Commons. It's located on the library side of the Torgersen
            bridge and can be reserved for classes or groups. Students can
            try out software tools and get help from experts in GIS and
            digital humanities.

   Dedicated to its motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), [176]Virginia
   Tech takes a hands-on, engaging approach to education, preparing
   scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the
   commonwealth's most comprehensive university and its leading research
   institution, Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree
   programs to more than 30,000 students and manages a research portfolio
   of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of
   transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and
   by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and
   across Virginia.
