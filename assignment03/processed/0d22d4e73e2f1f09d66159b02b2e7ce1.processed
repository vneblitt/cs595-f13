   Items for sale in the online auction for Jesse Jackson Jr. (WGN-TV)
   By Kim Geiger Tribune reporter

   7:02 a.m. CDT, September 17, 2013

   A dozen pieces of memorabilia and luxury clothing once owned by
   disgraced former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. are being auctioned off.

   The items include Michael Jackson and Bruce Lee memorabilia and fur
   coats and capes.

   The U.S. Marshals Service is selling the 12 items, which were
   surrendered by Jackson Jr. to help pay off a $750,000 money judgment
   against him. Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty in February to looting his
   campaign fund for personal expenses.

   The auction, which is being held online at [142]txauction.com, will end
   on Sept. 26. The proceeds will be deducted from the money judgment owed
   by Jackson Jr., according to the Marshals Service.

   Starting prices range from $115 for a cashmere cape with mink trim to
   $350 for the autographed Bruce Lee photo. Jackson Jr. paid $800 for the
   cape, according to documents that identified the items for forfeiture
   at the time that Jackson Jr. was charged.

   In addition to the money judgment, Jackson Jr. was sentenced last month
   to 30 months in prison. His wife, Sandi, pleaded guilty to tax charges
   for her involvement in the scheme and was sentenced to 12 months in
   prison. She also was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution.
