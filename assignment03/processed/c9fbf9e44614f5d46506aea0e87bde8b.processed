   Hundreds of firefighters are "digging trenches, clearing brush and
   starting back blazes to keep a wildfire raging north of [30]Yosemite
   National Park out of several mountain hamlets," The Associated Press
   writes Monday morning in its latest update on the huge "Rim Fire" that
   is threatening some of the power and water services to the city of San
   Francisco.

   [31]As Eyder wrote Sunday, the flames are also endangering some of the
   area's "beloved ancient sequoias."

   According to the AP, "firefighters were hoping to advance on the flames
   Monday but strong winds were threatening push the blaze closer to
   Tuolumne City and nearby communities."

   Our colleagues from Northern California's KQED are following the Rim
   Fire closely â in [32]their News Fix blog and on [33]a multimedia "Fire
   Tracker" designed by Southern California's KPCC. We'll embed the
   "graphic summary of the blaze," which is a good gateway to the
   coverage.
