   As we reflect on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, much
   has been said about what has changed in 50 years -- and what has not
   changed enough. As Congressman John Lewis reminded us -- at both the
   1963 and 2013 marches -- we have work to do on voting rights, on jobs,
   on equality of opportunity in this country.

   He's right about that, and about another thing: he used part of his
   brief speech to call out the need to pass an immigration reform
   measure, to "bring [immigrants] out into the light and set them on a
   path to citizenship."

   In saying those powerful words, he places the immigration issue
   squarely in a civil rights frame, which is right where it was 50 years
   ago, as Congress took up a series of civil rights proposals under
   President Johnson's leadership: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
   Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Immigration and Nationality Act of
   1965. This latter bill dramatically changed the way that immigrants
   were admitted to the United States, undoing a policy which allocated
   visas according to notions of racial superiority. You heard that right:
   for most of the 20th century, our immigration laws were based on the
   "racial" notion that some Europeans were superior to others. Think
   about what that meant to the rest of us.

   As Johnson pointed out in signing the act, under the old system,
   "...only three countries were allowed to supply 70 percent of all the
   immigrants. Families were kept apart because a husband or a wife or a
   child had been born in the wrong place. Men of needed skill and talent
   were denied entrance because they came from southern or eastern Europe
   or from one of the developing continents." Signing that bill into law
   was viewed at the time -- correctly -- as one of the great
   accomplishments for civil rights in America.

   Then as now, immigration reform was about restoring fundamental
   fairness to an outdated, broken system.

   Then as now, it was about reuniting families, creating an avenue for
   people with needed skills, and ensuring that everyone plays by the same
   set of rules.

   Then as now, it was about doing the hard work of making sure our nation
   makes progress on its road to becoming a more perfect union.

   And then as now, it enjoyed bipartisan support even as it faced
   obstacles from political figures who are doing everything they can to
   stand in the way of progress.

   And just as with the work ahead on voting rights, on jobs, on equality
   of opportunity, we can't let these detractors deter us. The value of
   looking back is that it inspires us for the road ahead, and reminds us
   to honor the sacrifices of those who paved the way to where we are
   today. If I take any message from Congressman Lewis' ringing words, it
   is that we all live in the same house, and we have come too far to give
   up now. Adelante. Or together, Si Se Puede!

   Blacks fought for well over a century for their civil rights and
   suffered mightily in the process. How dare " immigrants rights"
   activists think they are entitled to reap benefits from that struggle?

   ...shameless, shameless people with plenty of "allies", "advocates" and
   "advisors" in our country, on our campuses and in our courts...It will
   take nothing less than a civil war in the US to stop this
   madness...don't look to our government...they're all sold-out and

   Muñoz makes an intersting point about cuvil rights and viting and
   origins of the pcoming workforce seems like a lot of northern europeans
   find advantage in theur hoe countries in job avaikability, education
   and health care that may be lacking by comparison, here. The YS heled
   build european social cemocracies in such a way that emigration is not
   a priority.this is an interesting oersoective why looking siuth fir
   immigrants has becime an attractuve alternatuve to aerican e,ployers
   and hence the tecruitment.. Not that many niversity trained germans,
   italian, irish or french are going to take a baclbreaking field labirer
   jib in california or texas. The causes if migration are mostly
   economic. Politics takes a backseat to food and shelter and mist
   northern europeans are not under ooression or economic stress. Lewis
   was right to mention the similarity to the african amerucan experience
   in lnsome specific cases of voter supression and profiling. Because of
   perceived threat from people of color. Caribean imigrants show a racial
   mix that in the american context shiw the "human stain" that denies
   racial purity. Poster animal lover6 mises the point and may be offendd
   by realizing bigotry is an equal opportunity malady. This is why the
   "tipping point" is a milestone because now the si calked minorities are
   coequal in numbers to the old majority. It is niw time to build bridges
   of understanding in a nrw oeaceful coexistence between our grouos.

   Right now 60% of our immigrants are from one country. Maybe we need to
   make a law that limits immigration from the country that supplies most
   of our immigrants and ramp it up from countries in Europe, Asia and
   Africa. Just to be fair, certainly Cecilia Munoz doesn't want 60% of
   all immigrants coming from one section of the world, she decried that
   as racist!

   No she wants open borders so anyone who wants to can come here and be a
   citizen. One thing she forgot to say is a big number of the ones coming
   from latin America come here to sell drugs and nothing else. Lets just
   keep the laws we got a start protecting our borders that is really all
   that needs to be done. But we do need to think about a way to limit the
   number of immigrants for one country since most of our immigrants come
   from only one country. THis is not fair to people from say China or
   India who want to come here and can't because we are getting most from
   Mexico.

   ...that won't stop her...she and her ilk are absolutely deluded in
   their self-imposed "plight".
   I am surprised she hasn't started taking-up "the struggle" for the "La
   Tino" dinosaurs in the La Brea tarpits in Los Angeles.
   People like her have kissed and stroked a lot of others to get to where
   they are today...a lower perch on the poop-tree.

   This country needs to get rid of the notion that Europeans (of any
   region) are not "superior" to any one else. This country is supposed to
   be about equality----not a pecking order of superiority.
