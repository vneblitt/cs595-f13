Center for the History of Medicine's virtual exhibits explore eugenics, birth
control, smallpox

   September 4, 2013
   News from Harvard schools, offices, and affiliates

   The Center for the History of Medicine (CHM) at Countway Library
   recently debuted 17 online exhibits on their new platform that weave
   together fascinating stories illustrated by materials from the
   collections.

   Most of exhibits are linked to specific events--such as the center's
   largest undertaking, [82]Battle-Scarred: Caring for the Sick and
   Wounded of the Civil War, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the
   Civil War. This exhibit--two years in the making--was probably the most
   gratifying for Jack Eckert, public services librarian, who has been the
   driving force behind many CHM exhibitions.

   Until recently, CHM's virtual exhibitions existed as static HTML
   pages--with no interactivity or option to link to the items mentioned
   from the collections. Andra Langoussis, a Simmons student and part-time
   assistant in the center, has been migrating the HTML versions to
   OnView, the center's installation of Omeka, an open-source
   Web-publishing system for libraries, museums, archives, scholarly
   collections and exhibitions.

   Seventeen exhibitions are currently available to view on the new site.
   "OnView is exciting because now individual items are can be discovered
   through Google," said Emily Gustainis, head of collection services. The
   featured exhibitions rotate, so visitors can delve into different
   topics, and Langoussis continues to add more to the new site.

   "The holdings we have here are incredibly broad and deep," Hall said.
   "These exhibitions offer a way to tease out amazing narratives from the
   collection and provide access not only to entire collections, but also
   to individual items within them."
