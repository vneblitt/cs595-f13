A sustainable future with dignity for all

   This report by the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) collects the
   perspectives on the 'world we want' from over 1 million people around
   the globe. For almost one year, people have engaged energetically in 88
   national consultations, 11 thematic dialogues, and through the MY World
   global survey. As member states consult on the shape and content of a
   successor framework to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) beyond
   2015, it is hoped that the opportunity to listen to these voices will
   contribute to reaching consensus on what is needed to move towards a
   common sustainable future.

KEY MESSAGES

   The findings of this global conversation contain important messages for
   governments as they seek to agree on a new development agenda.
     * People demand to play a role in shaping and changing their world.
     * The fundamental areas covered by the MDGs remain critically
       important. At the same time, there is a call to strengthen ambition
       and urgency.
     * People are indignant at the injustice they feel because of growing
       inequalities and insecurities that exist particularly for poorer
       and marginalized people.
     * The challenges are complex and interlinked, requiring a sustainable
       development agenda that is integrated, holistic and universal,
       applying to all countries and all people.
     * People call for a new agenda built on human rights, and universal
       values of equality, justice and security. Better governance
       underpins many of their calls.
     * The focus on concrete, measurable goals should be retained but
       measurement of progress needs to be improved. A data revolution
       will support an accountability revolution.

WHAT ARE THE CONSULTATIONS TELLING US?

   This chapter summarizes the main findings from the global conversation
   .There is a strong desire to capture the momentum generated by the
   MDGs, but also to bring in additional areas and principles from the
   Millennium Declaration. The consultations also reflect the need to take
   into account issues that have emerged since 2000, as well as future
   challenges, particularly those linked to population dynamics and
   environmental degradation. There is a clear demand for tackling
   inequality, injustice and insecurity in all manifestations, and a
   strong recognition of the need to address governance concerns and
   increase accountability if goals are to be achieved sustainably. People
   express clearly the challenge of recognizing and respecting fundamental
   human rights, understanding the complexities of the various issues and
   the interlinkages between them, and taking up the call for a more
   ambitious and transformational agenda -- while retaining the focus on
   concrete, realistic and measurable goals.

ONE MILLION VOICES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

   This chapter reports on the messages coming out from the national
   consultations that have taken place in 88 countries across the world,
   grouped by region: Africa, Latin America & Caribbean, Asia & Pacific,
   Arab States, and Eastern Europe & Central Asia. These consultations
   have been led by UN Country Teams with the involvement of national
   governments and civil society. A particular focus was placed on
   reaching out to poor and marginalized people: those who would not
   normally be heard in global debates. For country-by-country results of
   the national consultations, please see the respective national reports.

A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

   This chapter summarizes the main points emerging from the 11 thematic
   consultations led by the UNDG in 2012-2013. The themes are: Addressing
   Inequalities; Conflict, Violence and Disaster; Education; Energy;
   Environmental Sustainability; Governance; Growth and Employment;
   Health; Hunger, Food Security and Nutrition; Population Dynamics; and
   Water. The consultations were jointly led by specialized UN agencies,
   and co-hosted by one or more countries. They benefited particularly
   from the active participation and support from civil society --
   individual citizens and organizations -- academic research institutes
   and the private sector. For the individual thematic reports and other
   documentation, please consult the respective thematic consultation
   spaces on this platform.
