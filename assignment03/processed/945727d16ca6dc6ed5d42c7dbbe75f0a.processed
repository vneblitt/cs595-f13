[16]Key findings:

     * Five years after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. went bankrupt, the
       CEOs of the banks that got into the biggest trouble during the
       financial crisis are living in luxury.
     * None of the top banking CEOs or senior executives has been
       prosecuted for actions taken that led to the financial crisis.
     * The CEOs have faced little liability for the financial wreckage
       that happened on their watch. Company insurance policies and
       shareholders have covered most legal settlements.

[17]After the Meltdown

   In the fall of 2008, the U.S. economy nearly collapsed thanks to an
   unprecedented wave of mortgage foreclosures. In "After the Meltdown --
   Where are they now?" the Center for Public Integrity revisits the
   subprime lenders, Wall Street banks and government regulators that were
   most responsible for the crash -- and finds few if any have been held
   accountable.

   Editor's note: Nearly five years ago, on Sept. 15, Lehman Brothers
   Holdings Inc. filed for Chapter 11, the largest bankruptcy in the
   nation's history. The move set off a series of dramatic actions in
   Washington, D.C., and on Wall Street as bankers and regulators sought
   to avoid a shutdown of the global economy. To mark the anniversary, the
   Center for Public Integrity is publishing [31]a three-part series on
   what has happened since the meltdown.

   Five years after the near-collapse of the nation's financial system,
   the economy continues a slow recovery marred by high unemployment,
   hesitant consumers and sluggish business investment.

   Many of the top Wall Street bankers who were largely responsible for
   the disaster -- and whose companies either collapsed or accepted
   billions in government bailouts -- are also unemployed. But since they
   walked away from the disaster with millions, they're juggling their
   ample free time between mansions and golf, skiing and tennis.

   Meantime, the major banks that survived the crisis, largely because
   they were saved with taxpayer money after being deemed "too big to
   fail," are now bigger and more powerful than ever.

   The Center for Public Integrity looked at what happened to five former
   Wall Street kingpins to see what they are up to these days. None are in
   jail, nor are any criminal charges expected to be filed.

   Certainly none are hurting for money.

   Take Richard Fuld. Five years after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the
   158-year-old company he ran, collapsed under the weight of bad
   investments and sent a tidal wave of panic through the global financial
   system, Fuld is living comfortably.

   He has a mansion in Greenwich, Conn., a 40-plus-acre ranch in Sun
   Valley, Idaho, as well as a five-bedroom home in Jupiter Island, Fla.
   He no longer has a place in Manhattan, since he sold his Park Avenue
   apartment in 2009 for $25.87 million.
   The other four bankers the Center caught up with -- Jimmy Cayne (Bear
   Stearns), Stanley O'Neal (Merrill Lynch), Chuck Prince (Citigroup) and
   Ken Lewis (Bank of America) are also living in quiet luxury.

   Meltdown primer

   A quick crisis refresher: During the early years of the last decade,
   U.S. home values were soaring, fueled by ultra-low interest rates.

   Wall Street investors, eager to get in on the party, developed an
   enormous appetite for bonds backed by the mortgages of everyday
   homeowners. Firms like Lehman would buy up thousands of mortgages, pool
   them together into a security, and sell the cash flow from the mortgage
   payments to investors, including pension funds and hedge funds.

   The bonds were thought to be almost as safe as U.S. Treasuries, but
   they carried a higher interest rate.

   The demand was so great that eventually mortgage lenders loosened their
   underwriting standards and made loans to people who couldn't afford
   them, just to satisfy hungry investors.

   When the housing market turned down in 2007 and homeowners began to
   default on their loans, the whole system began to crumble.

   In March 2008, Bear Stearns almost collapsed and was sold. Six months
   later, Lehman failed, setting off a chain reaction that killed dozens
   more banks and mortgage lenders. Weeks later, Congress approved a $700
   billion bailout of the financial system and soon nearly every major
   financial institution was on the dole.

   The ensuing recession destroyed as much as $34 trillion in wealth and
   sent the unemployment rate soaring above 10 percent for the first time
   in 25 years.

   "Every single one of these companies was insolvent," said Neil
   Barofsky, the former special inspector general overseeing the bailout,
   which was called the Trouble Asset Relief Program.

   "Clearly there was a large underpinning of fraud," said Barofsky, a
   former federal prosecutor, who argues the government didn't adequately
   pursue criminal charges against those who caused the crisis. "There was
   never really a comprehensive investigation. The Justice Department
   largely outsourced this to the Securities and Exchange Commission."

   Five years after the meltdown, the potential for a criminal prosecution
   of any of those involved in the events leading up to the collapse has
   faded as the statute of limitations for financial fraud ran out.

   The five ultra-rich former Wall Street chieftains have simultaneously
   faded into luxurious obscurity while the survivors -- Jamie Dimon of
   JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs -- have only
   consolidated their power as they alternate between being seen as great
   villains or near statesmen depending on the changing fortunes of their
   companies.

Richard Fuld, former CEO of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

     * Fuld earned about $69.5 million in 2007, the year before Lehman
       Brothers filed for bankruptcy in Sept. 2008. From 2000 to 2007, he
       was awarded about $889.5 million and cashed out about $529
       million of that before the company went bankrupt.
     * He owns homes in Greenwich, Connecticut, Jupiter Island, Florida,
       and a ranch in Sun Valley, Idaho.
     * Fuld has since started a consulting firm called Matrix Advisors
       LLC.

   Fuld checks in

   Five years after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, Fuld is keeping a
   low profile. He's not giving interviews or lectures, and he's not done
   an apology tour.

   At times he picks up the phone and calls up former Lehman co-workers --
   those whom he considers friends -- to check in.
   Kevin White, a former managing director at Lehman, says he hears from
   Fuld about once a month. The former CEO asks about White's family,
   checks on how business is at the hedge fund White founded after Lehman,
   offers to help, and perhaps introduce him to someone.

   "Dick's a family man and he's someone who takes this whole Lehman
   bankruptcy very personally," White says. He admits that some of his
   former colleagues hate Fuld and don't understand why White stays in
   touch.

   Fuld has been widely criticized, by former Lehman workers and in
   official investigations, for allowing the firm to drown itself in too
   much debt. When it went bankrupt, for every dollar of capital Lehman
   held, it was borrowing at least $30. Some reports say the rate was
   higher than 40 to 1.

   That gave it no cushion to absorb losses when the market began to
   decline.

   The myriad investigations into the causes of the crisis revealed that
   under Fuld's watch, Lehman executives toyed with the company's finances
   to make that leverage look better than it really was using what some
   Lehman employees called an "accounting gimmick" called Repo 105,
   according to the official bankruptcy report by Anton Valukas of the law
   firm Jenner & Block.

   The tactic allowed the company to characterize a short-term loan as an
   asset sale and then use the money from that false sale to cut debt. By
   doing so, Lehman appeared to have less debt and more cash. Lehman used
   Repo 105 transactions to cut the debt on its books by as much as $50
   billion just before it announced quarterly earnings, giving investors a
   false impression of the bank's financial health.

   In a legal filing in an investor lawsuit, Fuld and other Lehman
   executives said investors were informed that Lehman's leverage was
   often higher than it was at the end of each quarter.

   "Lehman specifically disclosed that its balance sheet `will fluctuate
   from time to time' and could be and at times was larger than its
   balance sheet reported at quarter- or year-end,' the filing said.

   Fuld, in testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission,
   blamed Lehman's failure on the government's decision not to give it a
   bailout.

   "Lehman was forced into bankruptcy not because it neglected to act
   responsibly or seek solutions to the crisis, but because of a decision,
   based on flawed information, not to provide Lehman with the support
   given to each of its competitors," he testified.

   "There is sufficient evidence ... that Fuld was at least grossly
   negligent," Valukas wrote in his report.

   Negligence isn't necessarily a crime, however, so Fuld has faced no
   punishment for the wreckage caused by his company's collapse, save
   perhaps banishment to irrelevance.

   Last year a federal judge approved a $90 million settlement of a class
   action suit brought by Lehman investors against Fuld and several other
   company executives and directors. The judge, Lewis Kaplan, questioned
   whether the settlement, which will be paid entirely by Lehman's
   insurers, was fair given that none of the individuals would pay out of
   pocket. He agreed to the deal, however, because litigation expenses for
   a trial were likely to deplete the funds available for compensating the
   investors.

   Fuld quietly opened his own advisory firm called Matrix Advisors in a
   Third Avenue office building in Manhattan, across the street from the
   headquarters of Avon, the cosmetics company. He's landed a few clients,
   according to news reports, SEC filings and court records. Matrix
   advised AT&T Inc. on its failed bid to purchase T-Mobile. And it has
   consulted with GlyEco, a company that recycles the chemical glycol, and
   Ecologic Transportation Corp., a company that rents out environmentally
   friendly cars.

   He was recently spotted at Doubles, the private dining club in the
   Sherry-Netherland Hotel in Manhattan, according to a former Lehman
   employee.

   Still, companies haven't been eager to have their names associated with
   Fuld, so landing clients hasn't been easy, according to two people
   familiar with the business.

   Fuld, through his lawyer, declined several interview requests for this
   story. He wasn't in his office when a reporter paid a visit in July.
   His assistant, through a security guard, declined to say where he was.

   Even if business is slow, it may not matter much to Fuld. Unlike many
   of his former employees, and unlike the millions of people still out of
   work after the 2008 financial collapse, Fuld has money.

   When Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, there was a
   sense that if Fuld had mismanaged Lehman to death, at least he had lost
   a load of cash in the process as the value of his company stock dropped
   to nothing.

   And he did lose plenty.

   Fuld's 10.8 million shares of the company that may have once been worth
   more than $900 million, according to a [33]study by Harvard University
   Professor Lucian Bebchuk, became worthless.

   However, he wasn't exactly on his way to the poor house. From 2000
   through 2007, Fuld took home as much as $529 million from his Lehman
   job. That includes his salary and cash bonuses, as well as the Lehman
   shares granted him by the company that he sold before the bankruptcy in
   September 2008.

   That total comes from an analysis by Oliver Budde, a former Lehman
   associate general counsel who left the firm in 2006 because, he says,
   Lehman was underreporting its executive compensation to shareholders.

   That income allowed Fuld to buy some very high-end real estate.

   In Greenwich, he has an $8 million, nine-bedroom home with a guest
   house. He and his wife, Kathleen, bought the house in 2004 after they
   sold their previous Greenwich home to Robert Steel, a Goldman Sachs
   executive who became undersecretary of the Treasury in 2006 under Henry
   Paulson. Steel then became CEO of Wachovia, which nearly collapsed 11
   days after Lehman and was sold to Wells Fargo at the direction of
   federal regulators.

   When he's looking to get out of Greenwich, Fuld can head south to
   Jupiter Island, Fla., a ritzy barrier island that's home to Tiger Woods
   and Greg Norman. He transferred ownership of the $10.6 million
   beachfront home, with a pool and tennis court, to his wife in November
   2008, a common strategy for protecting assets from legal judgments.

   He also spends a lot of time at his 40-plus-acre ranch in Ketchum,
   Idaho, in the center of the Sun Valley resort area. The spot offers
   "ultimate privacy," according to Daryl Fauth, CEO of [34]Blaine County
   Title in Ketchum.

   The ranch is located just five minutes from downtown Ketchum, east of
   the Baldy Mountain ski resort and west of the Reinheimer Ranch, a
   110-acre spread that's owned by the Idaho Foundation for Parks and
   Lands and can't be developed. The house is situated on a bend in a
   river that runs through the property.

   Fuld even managed to make a killing in real estate during the depths of
   the collapse. A Park Avenue apartment that he and his wife bought in
   2007 for $21 million was sold in 2009 for a $4.8 million gross profit.

   What he hasn't done is make any public statement or gesture or obvious
   effort to rehabilitate his image. He hasn't made any public overtures
   to major charities.
   He appears to have wound down his family foundation after Lehman went
   bankrupt, distributing the last $10,948 in 2009, according to tax
   filings. And last summer Fuld sued his estranged son-in-law seeking to
   recover money he had lent the younger man to buy a home with Fuld's
   daughter.

   Fuld was looking to be paid in cash and stock by those he advised,
   according to a person familiar with the company. That's the type
   of [35]agreement he struck with Ecologic, which paid him a
   $10,000-per-month retainer and granted him options to buy 2.29 million
   shares of its stock at 25 cents per share.

Jimmy Cayne, former CEO of Bear Stearns

     * Cayne retired from his CEO position in January 2008 after the
       company said it lost $1.7 billion in bad home loan bets. From 2000
       until his retirement in 2008, he brought home about $376.6 million.

       Raton, Florida.

   Jimmy's playing bridge

   While Fuld has tried to stay in the business, Jimmy Cayne of Bear
   Stearns has withdrawn completely.

   Cayne, who lives in a $25 million apartment in New York's Plaza Hotel,
   can be found almost every day in cyberspace hosting an online bridge
   game.

   Last month in the Hyatt Regency hotel in Atlanta, Cayne sat for hours
   in a crowded ballroom with orange, brown and yellow swirled carpet
   competing for the coveted Spingold Cup.

   Cayne sat in a crisply pressed shirt with his team -- two Italians and
   two Israelis -- chomping a cigar and talking in hushed tones over one
   of the dozens of folding tables. He likely pays his players more than
   $100,000 a year each to help him remain atop the world rankings,
   according to two people who have played in tournaments against him.

   He's ranked 22nd in the world, according to the American Contract
   Bridge League. Last month he lost in the round of 16 of the Spingold
   knockout match.

   That he's opted for bridge over finance is telling, as Cayne was much
   criticized for spending more time on golf and bridge than on dealing
   with the crises that were crushing his firm.

   While at Bear, Cayne would leave every Thursday and take a helicopter
   to his New Jersey beach house for long weekends of golf at the
   Hollywood Golf Club. He'd emerge from the chopper behind sunglasses and
   chomping the trademark cigar, according to people who saw him there.

   Cayne had survived the bankruptcy of two Bear Stearns hedge funds the
   summer before but succumbed to the inevitable when, in the fourth
   quarter of 2007, the company had to write down $1. 9 billion in bad
   home loan bets, leading to its first quarterly loss ever.

   He retired as CEO in January 2008, two months before the firm collapsed
   under the weight of its subprime mortgage investments, but remained as
   board chairman. As the market became doubtful that the mortgage bonds
   on Bear's books were worth what the company claimed, companies pulled
   their business, suddenly and en masse.

   Bear Stearns was sold on March 16, 2008, in a late night deal to
   JPMorgan Chase & Co., which eventually paid $1.2 billion, about what it
   would have cost to buy the company's Madison Avenue headquarters.

   The company's leverage ratio was 38 to 1 or higher, according to Phil
   Angelides, the chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.
   Cayne acknowledged in his testimony before the commission that it was
   too high.

   "That was the business," he said. "That was really industry practice."

   He told Angelides that he believed in Bear so strongly that he almost
   never sold its stock. "I rarely sold any of the firm's stock except as
   needed to pay taxes," he testified on May 5, 2010.

   Like Fuld, Cayne lost about $900 million on paper when Bear's stock
   plunged, but he took home plenty before the crash. He earned $87.5
   million in cash bonuses from 2000 to 2007 and sold stock worth about
   $289.1 million in those years, according to [36]Bebchuk's study.

   In addition to the Plaza Hotel condo, he and his wife have a second
   apartment on Park Avenue. They put that home on the market last month
   for $14.95 million. When they want to get out of the city, they can
   head to their $8.2 million mansion on the Jersey Shore, about a mile
   from the Hollywood Golf Club, or their [37]$2.75 million condo at
   the [38]Boca Beach Club in Boca Raton, Fla.

   Cayne, like many of his fellow CEOs, has apparently worked to shield
   his assets from potential liability.

   In November and December 2009, he transferred ownership of four pieces
   of real estate to four separate limited liability companies, called
   Legion Holdings I, II, III and IV, for a total of $21. Some of the LLCs
   share Cayne's Plaza Hotel mailing address in public tax records.

   "I take responsibility for what happened. I'm not going to walk away
   from the responsibility," Cayne told the FCIC.

   He hasn't had to take any for the demise of Bear, however. He's paid no
   judgments or settlements from any lawsuits, according to his lawyer,
   David Frankel.

Chuck Prince, former CEO of Citigroup

     * Prince resigned in November 2007 when the company announced it lost
       as much as $11 billion on subprime mortgage-backed securities. His
       golden parachute was $28 million, on top of $65.2 million in salary
       and bonuses since 2000 -- a total of $93.2 million.

       North Palm Beach, Florida.

   Chuck Prince is helping his friends

   While Fuld went down with his ship and Cayne remained until close to
   the end, two of their CEO brethren were pushed aside earlier -- when
   the subprime collapse began taking its toll on profits -- only to watch
   their companies falter from a distance.

   Charles O. Prince III resigned as CEO of Citigroup on Nov. 5, 2007,
   when the company announced it had lost between [39]$8 billion and $11
   billion on subprime mortgage bets.

   "Given the size of the recent losses in our mortgage-backed securities
   business, the only honorable course for me to take as Chief Executive
   Officer is to step down," he said in a statement. Prince walked away
   with a golden parachute worth about $33.6 million.

   From 2000 through his resignation, Prince took home $65.2 million in
   cash salary and bonuses, according to an analysis by the Center.  There
   are no SEC reports showing that he sold any shares from 2000 through
   2008. It's unclear whether he's sold any since he resigned.  Citigroup
   shares were priced at more than $300 the week Prince resigned and today
   hover at about $50 after a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.

   His downfall came only months after he famously justified Citi's
   continued involvement in subprime:

   "When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be
   complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up
   and dance. We're still dancing," he told The Financial Times in July
   2007.

   Prince was succeeded by Vikram Pandit, a former hedge fund manager
   whose firm was acquired by Citi just months earlier for $800 million.
   While Pandit was trying to right the listing ship, the company
   continued to provide Prince with an office, an administrative assistant
   and a car and driver for up to five years, a package worth $1.5 million
   a year, according [40]to SEC filings.

   By the end of 2008, Citigroup had received $45 billion in bailout money
   from the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve had guaranteed hundreds
   of millions of dollars of its debt.

   Prince apologized for the disaster that the financial crisis caused in
   testimony to the FCIC in 2010. "I'm sorry the financial crisis has had
   such a devastating impact for our country," he testified. "I'm sorry
   about the millions of people, average Americans, who lost their homes.
   And I'm sorry that our management team, starting with me, like so many
   others, could not see the unprecedented market collapse that lay before
   us."
   After Citigroup, Prince joined the global consulting firm Stonebridge
   International, which was founded by former National Security Advisor
   Sandy Berger. The company merged in 2009 with the Albright Group,
   founded by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to form
   Albright Stonebridge Group.

   Prince described his move to Albright Stonebridge as "helping my
   friends with their activities," in a 2009 [41]interview. When pressed
   about what his exact job was he said, "I'm just a friend."

   He's no longer listed as an executive on the company's website and a
   spokeswoman for the company did not respond to an email and phone call
   seeking an update on his status.

   He serves on the boards of directors of Xerox Corp. and Johnson &
   Johnson Inc. He's represented by the Harry Walker Agency as
   a [42]speaker for hire on topics including "Corporate Governance: A
   Five-Point Plan to the Best Business Practices," and "Inside the
   Current Financial Crisis."

   Last year Prince, along with Citigroup and several members of the
   company's pre-2008 board, settled a class action lawsuit for $590
   million that accused them of misleading investors about the amount of
   subprime-related securities the company held on its books and
   underreporting losses related to those investments. Prince and the
   other defendants didn't admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.

   It's unclear how often Prince went to the office held for him at Citi,
   but what is clear is that Prince had plenty of other places to spend
   his time.
   He has a $3.6 million Nantucket getaway and a $2.7 million house in a
   Jack Nicklaus golf community in North Palm Beach, Fla., called Lost
   Tree Village.

Stanley O'Neal, former CEO of Merrill Lynch

       billion on mortgage-backed securities, and was given a golden
       parachute of $161.5 million.

   Stan O'Neal goes to the Vineyard

   Prince's ouster from Citigroup was prefaced just days earlier by the
   departure of Stanley O'Neal from Merrill Lynch.

   O'Neal had taken over Merrill when it was mostly a retail brokerage
   firm and turned it into a major manufacturer of collateralized debt
   obligations, a type of security, backed by home mortgages.

   By 2006, it was the biggest underwriter of CDOs on Wall Street and a
   year later the company had $55 billion worth of subprime loans on its
   own books that no one wanted to buy.

   As the losses mounted, O'Neal made overtures, first to Bank of America,
   then to Wachovia, about buying Merrill Lynch -- without the approval of
   the board, according to a 2010 interview O'Neal gave to Fortune
   Magazine. When in October 2007 Merrill announced it was writing off $8
   billion of its mortgage-backed securities, and then news broke that
   O'Neal was thinking of selling the firm, it was over. He was fired.

   O'Neal floated out of Merrill comfortably, however, buoyed by a golden
   parachute worth $161.5 million. In the eight years leading up to his
   ouster, O'Neal earned $68.4 million in cash salary and bonuses, and he
   sold Merrill stock at a profit of at least $18.7 million, according to
   a Center review of annual reports and SEC filings.

   He was succeeded by John Thain, a former CEO of the New York Stock
   Exchange, who convinced Bank of America to buy Merrill Lynch for $50
   billion just as Lehman was imploding and taking much of the financial
   system with it.

   (Thain himself was eventually fired after it became public that he
   spent more than $1 million renovating his Merrill office -- including
   $87,700 for a pair of guest chairs -- as the company was on the verge
   of bankruptcy.)

   O'Neal, however, is flush. On top of his $161.5 million, he and his
   wife have a Park Avenue apartment. NBC anchor Tom Brokaw sold his
   apartment in the building for $10.75 million in 2011. O'Neal
   transferred full ownership to his wife in November 2008, a common
   strategy to protect the home from any legal judgments.

   Ken Lewis moves to Florida

   Kenneth Lewis survived the September 2008 bloodbath and even came out
   looking like a hero to some when he arranged Bank of America's hasty
   purchase of Merrill Lynch -- O'Neal's former employer -- for $50
   billion on the same weekend that Lehman failed, possibly saving it from
   the same fate as Lehman.

   It soon became clear that Merrill was no bargain. That, combined with
   Lewis' ill-advised purchase of subprime giant Countrywide Financial
   just as the housing market went into free fall, led Bank of America to
   start hemorrhaging cash.

   It eventually got $45 billion in bailout money from the federal
   government to stanch the bleeding.

   Lewis knew of Merrill's excess losses before shareholders approved the
   final deal, according to his 2009 testimony to then-New York Attorney
   General Andrew Cuomo.  He said he kept the losses hidden under pressure
   from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson who worried that, if the deal
   fell through, it would hurt the already wounded market and overall
   economy.

   Bank of America last month was accused by the Justice Department in a
   civil lawsuit of understating the risks that the loans included in $850
   million of mortgage-backed securities would default. The Justice
   Department said the company was so hungry for loans to securitize that
   it let its quality controls slide and didn't adequately verify
   borrowers' incomes or ability to repay. The suit did not name Lewis as
   a defendant.

   The company already settled a civil fraud suit with the SEC for $150
   million and another lawsuit brought by pension fund investors for $62.5
   million.

   Lewis retired in September 2009 with a going-away package worth $83
   million, even though the company was largely dependent on the federal
   government for its survival. He had already banked at least $86.4
   million from Bank of America stock sales between 2000 and 2008,
   according to SEC filings. He also brought in $52.4 million in salary
   and bonuses in that time.

   He and his wife Donna sold their house in Charlotte, N.C., in January
   for $3.15 million and their [43]mountainside mansion in Aspen for $13.5
   million, $3.35 million less than what they paid for it in 2006.

   They appear now to have only one home, a $4.1 million condo in a
   beachfront high-rise in Naples, Fla.

   The winners
   While Lewis and several of the CEOs that led their companies into the
   thicket of mortgage-backed securities have ended up rich but
   unemployed, two have seen their fortunes soar.

   Jamie Dimon and Lloyd Blankfein, the leaders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.
   and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., today stand atop the global financial
   system, their banks bigger and more powerful than ever and their
   personal fortunes growing.

   Blankfein was a magnet for scorn and envy before the crisis when
   Goldman awarded him a $68 million bonus in 2007, just as the economy
   was going bad. He then became the target for much of the public wrath
   that followed the collapse of the economy when he flippantly declared
   that Goldman was doing "God's work" by lending money to businesses.

   His reputation plummeted to its lowest point in 2010 after revelations
   that Goldman Sachs packaged and sold mortgage securities that appeared
   designed to fail, and then shorted the bonds, making a killing for the
   firm while customers lost money.

   The company was sued by the SEC over one such deal, called Abacus, and
   Goldman [44]settled the case for $550 million without admitting any
   wrongdoing.

   While Blankfein was the villain, Dimon was treated as a rock-star
   statesman.

   He was welcome at the White House and lauded as one of the only bankers
   who didn't need a bailout -- even though he took one, allegedly at the
   direction of  Paulson.

   Obama sang his praises in February 2009, just weeks after entering the
   Oval Office.

   "There are a lot of banks that are actually pretty well managed,
   JPMorgan being a good example," Obama [45]said. "Jamie Dimon, the CEO
   there, I don't think should be punished for doing a pretty good job
   managing an enormous portfolio."

   Dimon's popularity in the White House began to fade because he was a
   vocal opponent of many of the financial reforms being advocated in
   response to the crisis. Then in 2012, JPMorgan announced it had lost
   billions because of bad bets by a rogue derivatives trader in London.

   Dimon came under investigation for minimizing the issue to investors --
   he called the problem "a tempest in a teapot." The company was sued by
   the SEC, and Dimon had to testify before Congress. Last spring he
   barely survived a shareholder vote that would have separated his two
   jobs, chairman of the board and chief executive.

   Last month the company said it was under civil and criminal
   investigation by the Justice Department over its subprime
   mortgage-backed securities.

   When he hit the nadir of his troubles, Dimon reportedly sought advice
   from Blankfein on how to weather the storm and maintain his and his
   company's reputation.

   Earlier this summer, Blankfein held forth before a roomful of
   journalists and lobbyists at Washington's swank Mayflower Hotel where,
   like an elder statesman, he was asked about everything from immigration
   reform to his first job selling hot dogs at Yankee Stadium.
   BusinessWeek Magazine wrote a [46]story about the fashion impact of his
   new beard.

   Through the ups and downs, neither CEO has suffered financially.

   Blankfein was paid $21 million last year and he was the highest-paid
   chief executive of the 20 biggest financial companies, according to
   Bloomberg. Dimon earned about half that, or $11.5 million, as a result
   of the derivatives loss that became known as the "London whale."
   Blankfein owns about $256 million of Goldman shares, according to
   Forbes magazine.

   Dimon bought a Park Avenue apartment in 2004 for $4.9 million and
   bought a second unit in the same building this year for $2 million. He
   also owns a $17 million estate in Mt. Kisko, N.Y. Blankfein's Central
   Park West penthouse is valued at $26.5 million, according to New York
   property records. Late last year, he and his wife also bought a
   7.5-acre estate in the Hamptons with a pool and tennis court for $32.5
   million. Forbes estimates Dimon owns $223 million of JPMorgan stock.

   While Dimon and Blankfein held on to their power, the banks they lead,
   and other U.S. megabanks, have grown larger and more powerful.
   JPMorgan's assets -- one common measure of bank size -- have grown to
   $2.44 trillion from $1.78 trillion shortly before Lehman failed in
   2008. Bank of America's assets have ballooned to $2.13 trillion from
   $1.72 trillion, while Wells Fargo more than doubled to $1.44 trillion
   from $609 billion five years ago. Goldman Sachs, which wasn't on the
   list of top 50 bank holding companies in 2008 because it was a pure
   investment bank at the time, is now the nation's fifth largest with
   $939 billion in assets.
   Citigroup, beset by financial problems, is the only one of the top five
   banks whose balance sheet has shrunk in those years.

   Total assets don't even adequately measure the full size of these
   institutions because the measure does not take into account derivatives
   contracts or off-balance-sheet items that could still put the banks at
   risk. If those assets were counted, JPMorgan's size would rise to $3.95
   trillion, according to a [47]worksheet prepared by FDIC Vice Chairman
   Thomas Hoenig.

   `Bad guys everywhere'

   Since that epic month in 2008 that began with the bankruptcy of Lehman
   early Monday, Sept. 15, and ended with the $80 billion bailout of
   insurance giant American International Group and the sales of Merrill
   Lynch to Bank of America, Wachovia to Wells Fargo and Washington Mutual
   to JPMorgan, thousands of hours and millions of pages have been filled
   trying to determine what happened.

   The most comprehensive, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, said the
   financial collapse was avoidable.

   "The captains of finance and the public stewards of our financial
   system ignored warnings and failed to question, understand, and manage
   evolving risks within a system essential to the well-being of the
   American public. Theirs was a big miss, not a stumble," the report
   said.

   That those "captains of finance" have suffered few consequences of that
   "big miss" is now part of the legacy of the crisis, and has cast a
   shadow over the U.S. justice system, which prosecutes small-time
   offenders but appears to turn away from what many see as crimes of the
   wealthy.

   "This is the greatest white-collar fraud and most destructive
   white-collar fraud in history and we have found ourselves unable to
   prosecute any elite bankers," said [48]Bill Black, an economics and law
   professor at the University of Missouri and author of The Best Way to
   Rob a Bank is to Own One. "That's outrageous."

   U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder appeared to confirm that view earlier
   this year when he said he's hesitant to criminally prosecute big banks
   because he's afraid of the damage such a move could do to the economy.

   "When we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do
   bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national
   economy, perhaps even the world economy ... that is a function of the
   fact that some of these institutions have become too large," he said
   during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in March.

   Since that time, the Justice Department has walked back those
   statements and assured lawmakers and the public that they have
   aggressively investigated and pursued any criminal acts related to the
   financial crisis.
   The hurdle, officials say, is that to prove a crime, they must prove
   intent. That means if the government wanted to bring charges against
   any of the CEOs of the companies that led the nation to financial
   disaster, prosecutors would have to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable
   doubt that these individuals intended to commit fraud.

   "They tend to have to work in a much more black and white misconduct
   universe," said [49]Jordan Thomas, a former lawyer for the SEC who
   worked with Justice on many financial fraud cases. Proving criminal
   misconduct is such a high hurdle that the government has resorted
   mostly to civil charges, where the burden of proof is lower. That
   doesn't mean, Thomas says, that nobody did anything wrong.

   "The financial crisis had bad guys everywhere," he said.
