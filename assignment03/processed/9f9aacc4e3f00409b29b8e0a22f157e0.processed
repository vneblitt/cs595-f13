On closer inspection, not such a plain Jane

Lepore uncovers the story of Benjamin Franklin's sister

   September 11, 2013 | Editor's Pick Popular
   605

   Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer

   " `Few people's eyes are fellows,' " bifocals inventor Benjamin
   Franklin once wrote to his younger sister, Jane, according to historian
   and biographer Jill Lepore. "Jane thought of her brother as her second
   self. They were like a pair of eyes."
   By Sarah Sweeney, Harvard Staff Writer

   As a girl growing up on Franklin Street in Worcester, Jill Lepore
   learned about Benjamin Franklin, a Founding Father and the original
   jack-of-all-trades, but she certainly never suspected she'd someday be
   mired in the life of his nonfamous sibling, Jane. Jenny, he called her.
   Jenny called him Benny.

   "He loved no one longer," said [83]Lepore. "She loved no one better."

   In her latest work, "[84]Book of Ages: The Life and Opinions of Jane
   Franklin," Lepore, a professor of U.S. history at Harvard and a staff
   writer for The New Yorker, brings Jane and her story out of history's
   fog and into the open.

   In Franklin's day, schooling was not for girls. They learned to sew,
   then they married, gave birth, and died. Women were not taught to
   write, and those who could read were encouraged to read only "the
   Bible," said Lepore, "to be closer to God."

   "Jane Franklin did learn how to read," said Lepore. "I think it was her
   brother who taught her." Her literacy enabled a lifelong correspondence
   between them -- "one of the great unknown correspondences of American
   history and literature," Lepore said.

   To collage a biography of Jane, Lepore said during a talk at the
   [85]Radcliffe Institute Tuesday, was to do so through the lens of her
   brother. A real lens. Eyeglasses -- more specifically, Benjamin
   Franklin's spectacles. "His spectacles meant something to him," said
   Lepore. "They were the emblems of him. They marked him as a prodigious
   reader."

   Jane had married when she was just 15; the legal age in Massachusetts
   at the time was 16. She had 12 children in 24 years, losing many of
   them, while her husband struggled with mental and physical illness. She
   never left Boston.

   But Benjamin did. He became "an educated, enlightened, and independent
   man of the world," said Lepore. "A man of books, a man of learning, a
   man of science, a man of papers, a man of letters, a man of eyeglasses.
   A spectacle."

   In 1771, Franklin sent Jane 13 pairs of spectacles and handwritten
   instructions for selecting just the right pair. She was 59. "Why would
   [Jane] one day need 13 pairs of spectacles?" Lepore wondered.

   "[Benjamin had] signed the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of
   Paris, the Constitution, and she strained to form the letters of her
   name," she said.

   Lepore suggested that Franklin's gift signified his recognition of
   Jenny's edification -- her letters were rife with "news, gossip,
   recipes, blistering opinions about politics." Nevertheless, Jane was
   absent from "A Private Life," his autobiography. "It tells the story of
   a man as the story of a nation: self-made, rags to riches, the story of
   America. A spectacle for all the world to see," Lepore said. "In that
   story, he left his sister out."

   Though Jane wrote -- avidly -- she barely transcribed her life outside
   the letters to her brother. Only a 16-page pamphlet exists, "The Book
   of Ages," its title written in calligraphy. While writing her own "Book
   of Ages," Lepore went to the archives and held it herself. "It is a
   record in grief of a life lived rags to rags," she said of the tiny
   book -- a list of births and deaths of her children.

   We all know something of Benjamin Franklin, Lepore told the overflow
   crowd at the Knafel Center. "But what about Jane? Had she nothing more
   to say?"

   During her research, Lepore recalled, she put on a pair of spectacles
   similar to the ones Jane herself likely would have worn. "I began to
   think, as I looked at it all over again, that maybe Jane Franklin had
   something to say after all."

   When Jane was 21, said Lepore, her brother sent her a copy of "The
   Ladies Library." Benjamin Franklin went on to found the first lending
   library, but Jane, too, loaned books out, to other women. When she was
   74, she put on her spectacles and read "Four Dissertations" by Richard
   Price. Franklin invented, among other things, bifocals.

   " `Few people's eyes are fellows' he once wrote to her," said Lepore.
   "Jane thought of her brother as her second self. They were like a pair
   of eyes."

   No image of Jane Franklin exists. In every painting of her brother, he
   wears his trademark spectacles.

   With her brother's help, "Jane became a radical political philosopher,"
   said Lepore. But in secret.

   Conversely, "Everyone knows something of the lore of Benjamin
   Franklin," she said. "He was a spectacle, she was a speck."
