Explore the Iconic Mount Rushmore

   [56]image

   Summer is a great time to take advantage of our national parks and
   monuments. Many offer free or low-cost admissions and programs perfect
   for families. So this summer we will be featuring one of our country's
   public lands every week and highlighting things you and your family can
   do there.

Mount Rushmore

   Park Service.

   Mount Rushmore is iconic, there's no doubt about it! The massive
   carving, with its surrounding mountainside, is one of our nation's most
   recognizable public landmarks. That's not all there is to it, though -
   by visiting this public land, you can learn about the [57]sculptures'
   tumultuous history, explore the Avenue of Flags or take a hike in the
   South Dakota Black Hills.

   More than 3 million visitors from across the nation and around the
   world visit the park annually, to see the landmark that has been
   described as a "symbol of freedom and hope for people from all cultures
   and backgrounds."

   Initially, Doane Robinson, often called the "Father of Mount Rushmore,"
   intended for a carving of one of the Needles in the likeness of a
   notable Sioux. This plan changed as time went on and today, the
   carvings of [58]four great American presidents look out from the side
   of Mount Rushmore.

    To learn more about the history of the installation - including the
   blasting away of one of the president's heads in 1933 and the proposal
   of including Susan B. Anthony on the mountainside - check out [59]PBS's
   timeline of Mount Rushmore's creation.

   After taking a snapshot of the 60-foot-tall heads staring out at you
   from the ancient rock, be sure to check out the other activities that
   the park has to offer:
     * Visit the [60]Avenue of Flags (PDF), created as a celebration of
       America's bicentennial
     * Take a guided walk to the Sculptor's Studio, or one of the other
       [61]available ranger tours
     * Attend the Evening Sculpture Lighting Ceremony which takes place at
       approximately 9 p.m. nightly from May to September
     * Take in the Burkett Plaque, in honor of then-college student
       William Andrew Burkett's [62]award-winning essay (PDF)
     * Bask in the beauty of the Black Hills of South Dakota

   When planning your visit, you can check out the [63]National Weather
   Service's forecast or read [64]brochures about the park, available
   online through the National Park Service. You can also read President
   George Bush's [65]remarks at the park's dedication July 3, 1991,
   available courtesy of the American Presidency Project.
