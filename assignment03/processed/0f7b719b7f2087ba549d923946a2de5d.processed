As school year revs up, plaza counters with soothing petting zoo

   and play with animals as part of a community-building event by Common
   Spaces.
   By Jennifer Doody, Harvard Correspondent

   On the Science Center Plaza, delighted passersby spent time at a small
   petting zoo, taking time out to caress and pat the rabbits, ducklings,
   piglets, and kittens. Nearby, a friendly therapy dog had folks reaching
   out to say hello.

   The animals were on campus last Thursday -- and will be back again for
   the next few Thursdays at noon -- as part of a community-building event
   by [83]Common Spaces, an initiative of Harvard President Drew Faust
   that is designed to foster community on campus. The petting zoo will
   provide freshmen and other students, faculty members, and staff with
   some serious snuggle time.

   Isabelle Jenkins, a graduate student at the [84]Divinity School who has
   interned at the [85]Harvard College Women's Center, said the animals
   immediately changed her outlook.

   "If I were a new student on campus, this would definitely make me feel
   less homesick," she said. "I stepped into the pen and was surrounded by
   bunnies. It was heaven."

   For Madeline Meehan, Common Spaces' director of events, that sense of
   calm, community, and perspective is exactly what the organization was
   hoping to create.

   "We want to support the students as they're transitioning into their
   new homes," she said, adding that programming for the plaza will
   include student performances as well as the pet therapy. "People are
   always running at Harvard -- through the Yard, to class, to their next
   meeting. It's our job to help people stop, relax, and enjoy the
   environment here at Harvard."

   Tanya Iatridis, senior director of University planning, said the idea
   for the petting zoo came from the students.

   "In many of our Common Spaces focus groups, students told us that when
   they leave their homes and come to this highly stressful environment
   they can feel lonely, especially in the first month, and that a petting
   zoo at the plaza might help," she said. "They came up with the idea,
   and (today's) turnout, I think, says a lot."

   Iatridis added that while the University's Schools have individual
   common spaces, there were few locations on campus that were created to
   be comfortable for everyone. Areas such as the plaza and the porch on
   the steps of Memorial Church have been transformed by bringing in
   seating, tables, and programming, creating opportunities for members of
   the community to share space together.

   "Common spaces are very dynamic," Iatridis said. "For people to be able
   to stop and relax in one of these locations -- even just for a moment
   and even if they're alone -- allows them to connect as an important
   part of this great community. That's the president's initiative."

   Chad Lowman, whose dog Toby is registered with [86]Therapy Dogs
   International, said that, for students, moving to new locations and
   starting at new schools were stressful on their own. Together, they can
   seem overwhelming.

   "The unconditional love of a dog may be just the thing to make those
   transitions a little less scary," said Lowman, who brought Toby to the
   campus. "We enjoyed meeting so many people at Harvard who stopped by to
   give and get some affection. Toby is excited to come back to help bring
   a little joy to even more people. The petting and hugs feel good to
   him, too."

   Holding a week-old kitten in a blanket, Whitney Gardner of [87]Animal
   Craze, the traveling farm that brought the zoo animals to Harvard, said
   it was rewarding to see the positive effect the animals had on the
   community.

   "We're going to be here every Thursday for [88]the next few weeks," she
   said. "The people have been great, and the turnout is just wonderful.
   We're looking forward to coming back."
