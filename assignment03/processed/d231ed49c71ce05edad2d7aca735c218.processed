Explore your options as a Social Security beneficiary

   Choosing to work can change your life. If you have a disability and
   want to work, the Ticket to Work program may be right for you. We will
   connect you with the right people to help you explore your options,
   prepare for work, or gain experience while staying in control of your
   benefit choices. If you are age 18 through 64 and receive Social
   Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income
   (SSI) you already qualify. As you explore your work options, you may be
   asking:
     * How will work and income affect my benefits?
     * What will happen to my health insurance coverage if I choose to
       work?
     * What will happen if I try to work, but have to stop working because
       of my disability?

   Get answers to your questions, access information and resources, and
   receive expert advice on Work Incentives and the Ticket to Work
   program. [37]LEARN MORE >
