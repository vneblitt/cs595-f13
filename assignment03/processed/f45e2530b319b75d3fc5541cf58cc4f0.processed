   [89]Stanley Kubrick's "Paths of Glory" (1957) closes with a scene that
   doesn't seem organic to the movie. We've seen harrowing battlefield
   carnage, a morally rotten court-martial, French army generals corrupt
   and cynical beyond all imagining, and now what do we see? Drunken
   soldiers, crowded into a bistro, banging their beer steins on the
   tables as the owner brings a frightened German girl onstage.

   He makes lascivious remarks about her figure and cruel ones about her
   lack of talent, but she has been captured and must be forced to
   perform. Hoots and whistles arise from the crowd. The frightened girl
   begins to sing. The noise from the crowd dies away. Her tremulous voice
   fills the room. She sings "The Faithful Hussar." A hush falls, and some
   of the soldiers begin to hum the notes; they know the song but not the
   words.

   If the singing of "La Marseillaise" in a bar in "[90]Casablanca" was a
   call to patriotism, this scene is an argument against it. It creates a
   moment of quiet and tenderness in the daily horror these soldiers
   occupy -- a world in which generals casually estimated that 55 percent
   of these very men might be killed in a stupid attack and found that
   acceptable.

   Songs at the ends of dramas usually make us feel better. They are part
   of closure. This song at the end of this movie makes us feel more
   forlorn. It is not a release, but a twist of Kubrick's emotional knife.
   When Truffaut famously said that it was impossible to make an anti-war
   movie, because action argues in favor of itself, he could not have been
   thinking of "Paths of Glory," and no wonder: Because of its harsh
   portrait of the French army, the film was banned in France until 1975.

   The film, made in 1957, is typical of Kubrick's earlier work in being
   short (84 minutes), tight, told with an economy approaching terseness.
   Later his films would expand in length and epic scope, sometimes to
   their advantage, sometimes not. It does however contain examples of one
   of his favorite visual strategies, the extended camera movement that
   unfolds to reveal details of a set or location, and continues long
   after we expect it to be over.

   Early in the film, the camera precedes its hero, Col. Dax ([91]Kirk
   Douglas) on an inspection tour of a muddy fortified trench that goes on
   and on and on. Later the camera follows doomed men into No Man's Land,
   tracking alongside them through mud and shell blasts, trenches and
   craters, past bodies that drop before our eyes. Still later, there is a
   dolly shot through a formal ball to find a French general. And toward
   the end, an elaborate military parade for a firing squad, with the
   camera preceding three condemned men as they walk and walk and walk
   toward their deaths.

   These shots of long duration impress the importance of their subjects
   upon us: The permanence of trench warfare, the devastation of attack,
   the hypocrisy of the ruling class, the dread of the condemned men. If
   some of Kubrick's later extended shots, including the endless tracking
   shot down long hotel corridors in "[92]The Shining" (1979), seem like
   exercises in style, the shots in "Paths of Glory" are aimed straight at
   our emotions.

   The story is simply summarized. French and German armies face each
   other along 500 miles of fortified trenches. Both sides have been dug
   in for two years. Any attempt at an advance brings a dreadful human
   cost in lives. The effete little Gen. Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) orders
   his subordinate, Gen. Mireau (George Macready), to take an impregnable
   German position, "The Anthill," by, incredibly, the day after tomorrow.
   Mireau argues that it cannot be done. Broulard thinks perhaps it can be
   accomplished with no more than 55 percent casualties. He hints that
   there is a promotion and a third star for the general who does it. The
   two-star Gen. Mireau goes through the motions of protest: "The lives of
   8,000 men! What is my ambition against that? My reputation?" And then:
   "But, by god, we might just do it!"

   Col. Dax must lead the charge. He knows it is doomed, and he protests,
   but he follows orders. In a scene set the night before the raid, a
   scene which in other language might have been conceived by Shakespeare,
   two of his men debate the merits of dying by machinegun or bayonet. One
   chooses the machinegun, because it is quick; while the bayonet might
   not kill, it would hurt. The other says that proves he is more afraid
   of pain than death.

   The actual assault has a realism that is convincing even now that we
   have seen Stone's "[93]Platoon" and Spielberg's "[94]Saving Private
   Ryan." The black-and-white photography is the correct choice; this is a
   world of shapes and shadows, mud and smoke, not a world for color. The
   loss of life is devastating. The advance is halted. Watching from the
   safety of the trenches, Gen. Mireau decides the men are cowards and
   orders French artillery to fire on their own men, to drive them
   forward. The battery commander refuses to act without a written order.

   At the end of the day, to save face and protect his promotion, Mireau
   orders that three men, one from each company, must be executed for
   cowardice. One is chosen by lot. One because he is "socially
   undesirable." One because he was an eyewitness to the cowardice of a
   superior officer, who abandoned a comrade on a reconnaissance mission.
   Dax is outraged and asks to act as defense counsel before the military
   tribunal, which is, as we expect, a farce. When Dax argues for the
   defense that any further advance was "impossible," the prosecutor
   snaps, "if it was impossible, the only proof of that would be their
   dead bodies at the bottom of the trenches." The survivors are obviously
   cowards, then, because they are alive.

   That night, the condemned men share the same cell. "Do you see that
   cockroach?" one says. "Tomorrow morning I'll be dead, and it will be
   alive." The film until this point has been bitter and unromantic, but
   we think we glimpse a turn in the plot. Dax learns of Mireau's order to
   fire French artillery at French troops. He finds Gen. Broulard at a
   fancy ball and informs him of Mireau's artillery order. In any
   conventional war movie, in a film made by 99 directors out of 100,
   there would be an 11th-hour reprieve, the condemned men would be
   spared, and the stupid and treacherous Mireau would be publicly
   humiliated.

   Not here. Kubrick finds a way to draw all his story threads tight
   without compromising his harsh and unforgiving theme. The plot is
   resolved, yes, but cruelty and duplicity survive, and private soldiers
   are still meaningless pawns. Broulard believes the executions will be
   "a perfect tonic" for the army: "One way to maintain discipline is to
   shoot a man now and then."

   "Paths of Glory" was the film by which Stanley Kubrick entered the
   ranks of great directors, never to leave them. When I interviewed Kirk
   Douglas in 1969, he recalled it as the summit of his acting career:
   "There's a picture that will always be good, years from now. I don't
   have to wait 50 years to know that; I know it now." It has an economy
   of expression that is almost brutal; it is one of the few narrative
   films in which you sense the anger in the telling. [95]Samuel Fuller,
   who fought all the way through World War II, remembered it in "[96]The
   Big Red One" with nostalgia for the camaraderie of his outfit. There is
   no nostalgia in "Paths of Glory." Only nightmare.

   Kubrick and his cinematographer, George Krause, use sharp and deep
   focus for every shot. There is not a single shot composed only for
   beauty; the movie's visual style is to look, and look hard. Kirk
   Douglas, a star whose intelligence and ambition sometimes pulled him
   away from the comfortable path mapped by the system, contains most of
   the emotion of his character. When he is angry, we know it, but he
   stays just within the edge of going too far. He remains an officer. He
   does his duty. He finds a way to define his duty more deeply than his
   superiors would have wished, but in a way, they cannot condemn.

   And then that final song. It is sung by a young actress named
   Christiane Harlan, who soon after married Stanley Kubrick. One day in
   the summer of 2000, I visited her on their farm outside London, and we
   walked through the garden to the boulder engraved with Kubrick's name,
   under which he rests. I wanted to tell her how special and powerful
   that scene was, how it came out of nowhere to provide a heartbreaking
   coda, how by cutting away from his main story Kubrick cut right into
   the heart of it. But it didn't seem like the moment for film criticism,
   and I was sure she already knew whatever I could tell her.

   A restored print of "Paths of Glory" opened Friday at the Music Box.
   Also read my [97]1969 Esquire interview with Kirk Douglas, and Great
   Movie reviews of Kubrick's "[98]2001: A Space Odyssey" and [99]"Dr.
   Strangelove, or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb"
   and Fuller's "The Big Red One."
