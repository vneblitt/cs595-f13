   On that sweltering August day in 1963, almost a quarter-million people
   thronged the National Mall, from the Washington Monument to the
   columned marble box that is the Lincoln Memorial. The crowning moment,
   of course, was Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have A Dream" speech.

   Looking out upon the packed Mall, King told the integrated crowd that
   the nation's black citizens would not be satisfied until they were
   equal in every way, as thunderous applause broke out around him: "We
   are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls
   down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream!"

   In addition to King, vintage photos from the day prominently show Roy
   Wilkins, Whitney Young, Asa Philip Randolph â the architect of the
   march â and a very young John Lewis,who is one of the few original
   speakers still living.

   Women were relegated to the background, even one as eminent as Dorothy
   Height, the president of the National Council of Negro Women. Or they
   were cultural adornments, like the iconic mezzo-soprano Marian
   Anderson, who serenaded the crowd with an elegant rendition of the old
   Negro spiritual, "He's Got The Whole World In His Hand."

   Not Just The Movement's Background Singers

   Former journalist Lynne Olson, who wrote Freedom's Daughters, a history
   of women in the civil rights movement, says that the pre-feminist time
   was conducive to putting a spotlight on the movement's male figures â
   not that the men were complaining about that.

   "They regarded themselves as the leaders," she says. "They were
   regarded by the press as the leaders, it was just part of the times.
   Men were out there; women were in the background really doing most of
   the work." Women ran the mimeograph machines, made sandwiches, placed
   phone calls and passed out flyers with information on gatherings.

   Olson believes this was the secret to the movement's forward progress:
   "Without women, the civil rights movement would never have gotten off
   the ground. They were the ones who were the organizers â they were
   really the ground troops."

   But, says filmmaker Judy Richardson, the movement's women were not
   content to only be the ground troops.

   "Women weren't just the foot soldiers to the movement," she says
   firmly. "We weren't just the background singers â we were at the mic!"

   Richardson was one of the producers on the award-winning Eyes on the
   Prize documentary series, and also an editor of Hands on the Freedom
   Plow, a series of 52 personal histories from women who worked in the
   Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC.

   Compared to the middle-aged members of the Southern Christian
   Leadership Conference or the NAACP, SNCC's membership was very young â
   kids in their teens and college students who came together to fight for
   racial equality. Richardson says SNCC women, who'd been active on their
   own campuses, didn't intend to take a back seat because of their
   gender.

   "In SNCC, the women worked alongside the men," Richardson says. "It's
   not that there was no sexism in SNCC â but there was a lot less than in
   many of the other organizations."

   The SNCC students were guided by Ella Baker, who had helped King start
   the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She had also been a field
   secretary for the NAACP. Baker stressed to her fired-up charges that
   they were activists, yes, but their job was to grow leaders at the
   grass-roots level â local leadership that would outlast the college
   kids' presence.

   Baker was often referred to as the "Godmother of SNCC" for her
   protection and counsel. Richardson says Baker taught the young people
   to keep in mind the delicate balance they were trying to achieve.

   "The bottom line was, we're trying to figure out how to get black
   people registered to vote without getting them killed," she says.

   'Is This America?'

   The right to vote was something Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer had been working
   on in Mississippi for years. She'd been thrown off the Delta plantation
   where she'd worked, been beaten almost to death and jailed for
   insisting on her right to register to vote. Despite that, she
   crisscrossed the Delta, organizing and boosting morale with her
   signature freedom songs and spirituals.

   Mrs. Hamer helped found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, which
   challenged the all-white Mississippi delegation to the 1964 Democratic
   National Convention in Atlantic City. Her impassioned testimony to the
   DNC's Credentials Committee reverberated all the way to the White
   House, where a furious Lyndon Johnson listened.

   "If the Freedom Democratic Party is not seated â now â I question
   America. Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the
   brave?" Mrs. Hamer asked her mesmerized listeners. It was a shame, she
   told them, that she and others had to sleep with their telephones off
   the hook because they received so many death threats from irate
   segregationists.

   Johnson was afraid the Southern states would bolt if he unseated
   Mississippi's segregated delegation to seat the Mississippi Freedom
   Democrat Party. When, as a compromise, the integrated delegation was
   offered two token seats, Hamer refused, with the legendary retort: "We
   didn't come all this way for no two seats when all of us is tired."

   The skills that women â black and white â developed in the civil rights
   movement in the '60s would go on to help other movements as they
   strategized for their own rights. Women, LGBT activists and now those
   dedicated to immigrants' rights all benefited from the movement â a
   direct result of the work of women, both well-known and unknown, who
   were an essential part of the movement's success.
