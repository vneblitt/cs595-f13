Land-Degradation Neutral World

   Top Image
   Main Html
   Land-degradation neutral world is an aspirational goal, which was
   agreed at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in June
   2012. To achieve this goal, land degradation should be avoided and for
   every hectare of degraded land a hectare of land should be restored
   preferably in the same ecosystem and landscape. A land-degradation
   neutral world is a prerequisite for assuring water, food and energy
   security, alleviating poverty and mitigating climate change.
   At the Rio+20 Conference, world leaders recognized land degradation,
   desertification and drought as serious global challenges,  impeding
   sustainable development globally and committed to "strive to achieve a
   land-degradation neutral world". They also reaffirmed their resolve
   under the UNCCD to take coordinated action nationally, regionally and
   internationally, to monitor land degradation globally and further
   develop and implement scientifically based and socially inclusive
   indicators for monitoring and assessing the extent of desertification,
   land degradation and drought.
   Over past decades land degradation accelerated over 36 times its
   historical rate, leading to poverty and hunger, climate change related
   shocks and loss of biodiversity. Due to the prevailing paradigm of
   "Degrade - Abandon - Migrate" today millions of square kilometers in
   the world bear the legacy of man-made barren lands.
   At the Rio+20 last June, world leaders recognized the need for urgent
   action to reverse land degradation and agreed to "strive to achieve a
   land-degradation neutral world in the context of sustainable
   development". It is a call for a paradigm shift at all levels. Avoiding
   land degradation and restoring degraded land is a prerequisite for
   achieving food, water and energy security.
   We have to make sure that this aspirational goal does not stay on the
   paper, but is operationalized into attainable targets. We need to learn
   from the MDG lessons and make sure that land preservation and
   restoration takes its deserved place in the post2015 global development
   agenda. I encourage governments, scientists, civil society and every
   single individual to join our call for a land-degradation neutral
   world. Luc Gnacadja, UNCCD Executive Secretary.
   "The growing global population is increasing demand for food at a time
   when land availability and fertility is declining. Yet, there is little
   attention to land degradation and no global consensus on how to reverse
   this problem. To achieve global sustainable development, we must ensure
   that restoration of land equals or exceeds degradation: in other words
   we need "land degradation neutrality". Knowledge is not a barrier -
   abundant examples of community sustainable land management and land
   restoration are already out there. To go to scale we need governments
   to acknowledge the urgency of land degradation and place greater
   emphasis on ecologically-sensitive land management strategies."
   Jonathan Davies, Global Drylands Initiative Coordinator, IUCN.
   The aspired land degradation neutrality at the global scale will be
   attained by a concerted effort to attain zero net land degradation at
   the local, national and regional scales. The pre-requisite for this is
   awareness of land users that their practices are degrading land
   productivity and awareness of land owners, whose land already lost its
   productivity and requires restoration investments.
   Once awareness is there and practices for arresting ongoing degradation
   are used and measures of restoration of already degraded land are
   taken, it will be necessary to monitor and evaluate the effect of these
   practices. These are challenges for the scientific community and for
   land users, which should and can be met, thus leading the way for
   making the required decisions, policies, investments and actions that
   would make a land-degradation neutral world a tangible reality. Prof.
   Uriel Safriel, Ben-Gurion University, Israel.
