Why Quit?


   Quitting may improve your health and wellness.  If you quit smoking,
   you may:

     * lower your chance of dying of lung cancer
     * improve your skin
     * reduce bad breath


   Whatever your reasons for quitting, you have made the right choice.


Why is it so hard to quit?


   Many people who smoke become addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes and
   other tobacco products. When you try to stop smoking, you might:
     * crave cigarettes
     * feel nervous
     * feel irritable (cranky)
     * have headaches
     * have problems sleeping
     * feel depressed


   These may be signs of nicotine withdrawal. Talk to your health care
   provider about the medicines listed in this booklet that may help you
   deal with withdrawal.

     __________________________________________________________________

Nicotine Replacement Products


   Nicotine replacement products give your body nicotine without most of
   the other chemicals found in cigarettes and other kinds of tobacco.
   These products help you wean your body off tobacco and help you deal
   with withdrawal.

     * Read the label and talk to your healthcare provider as needed about
       the right way to use each product.
     * Ask how these products will affect your other medicines. Ask about
       the risks and side effects.
     * Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should only use nicotine
       replacement products if their doctor says that it is OK.

Other Medicines to Help You Quit


   Some prescription medicines have been found to help people deal with
   the withdrawal symptoms they feel when they quit smoking. Talk to your
   health care provider about the benefits, risks, and side effects for
   each medicine. Before taking these medicines, tell your doctor if you
   have ever had depression or other mental health problems. You should
   also tell your doctor about any symptoms you had during other times you
   tried to quit smoking.

   Other Things to Consider

   Some people who take these medicines have had serious changes in their
   mood and behavior. These changes can happen while you are taking them
   or after you stop. Stop use and call a doctor right away if you notice
