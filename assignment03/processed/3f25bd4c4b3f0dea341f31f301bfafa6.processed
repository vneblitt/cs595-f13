Support rape survivors in Ecuador

   By Heather Holdridge ([15]Contact)

   To be delivered to: Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador
   Petition Statement
   I support the removal of criminal penalties for women who seek an
   abortion and the elimination of all penalties for women and girls who
   seek abortion as a result of sexual violence.

Petition Background

   Rape survivors in Ecuador deserve access to safe and legal abortion
   services.
   Despite a president who has demonstrated a commitment to other aspects
   of women's health, Ecuador's current criminal code allows abortion only
   for victims of rape with mental disabilities, significantly excluding
   millions of women in a country where one in four women has been the
   victim of sexual violence. This policy puts the health and lives of
   rape victims in danger, and represents an unacceptable departure from
   international court rulings, as detailed in a new Human Rights Watch
   report.
   Rape survivors and all women in Ecuador and around the world deserve
   access to comprehensive health services including abortion if
   requested. A woman or girl who has suffered the trauma of rape
   shouldn't have to face the prospect of going to jail if she chooses to
   get an abortion. It is unacceptable for this or any government to
   continue to ignore the rights of women.
