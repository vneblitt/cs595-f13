Forest researchers seek economical ways to use wood waste for energy

   Faculty and students in the [83]College of Natural Resources and
   Environment's [84]Department of Forest Resources and Environmental
   Conservation are making their mark in the use of forest biomass -- the
   woody "waste" or residues from timber harvesting -- as an increasingly
   important source of renewable energy.


   Miles Groover collects chip and residue samples for size, nutrient, and
   energy content analysis. Miles Groover, who received his master's
   degree in forestry and forest products in 2011, collects chip and
   residue samples for size, nutrient, and energy content analysis. Photo

   In Virginia alone, six new facilities, including four Dominion power
   plants, soon will use woody biomass fuel to produce electricity, and
   the discoveries from Virginia Tech contribute to the efficiency,
   sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of harvesting biomass for
   energy.

   "Woody biomass has been used as an energy source for many years, but it
   has increased substantially over the past decade," said [85]Chad
   Bolding, associate professor of forest operations/engineering. Woody
   residues are the primary material used for renewable energy generation
   today. They are processed into wood chips or pellets that can be burned
   for fuel.

   Most states have adopted guidelines for increasing the use of renewable
   fuels. Thirty percent of Vermont's students attend wood-heated public
   schools. In Virginia, Dominion's Pittsylvania plant is one of the
   largest biomass power stations on the East Coast, powering more than
   20,000 homes.

   With efficient, large-scale operations, however, biomass could serve
   many more. But biomass is only attractive as a renewable fuel source if
   it is cost-effective and sustainable. Its harvest and production must
   be managed to protect the envirornment, and all stakeholders, including
   landowners and industry, must make a profit.

   Bolding and his students are taking a systems approach, studying how
   biomass can best be harvested, transported, and processed. They are
   developing more efficient processes for industry to conserve
   environmental resources such as soil and nutrients while maximizing
   economic potential.

   Some fear that removing biomass for energy will do more harm than good,
   decreasing soil nutrients and ultimately damaging forest health.
   Bolding found in one study that nutrient removal rates from biomass
   harvesting are generally not substantial enough to cause long-term
   declines in forest productivity.

   master of forestry in 2011, uses a soil auger to assess below-ground
   soil conditions at different depths before harvesting. Photo courtesy

   Additional studies Bolding has conducted with graduate students include
   the following topics:
     * The sustainability of biomass harvesting
     * The optimal wood chip size to maximize energy production
     * The size of woody biomass materials used to produce wood chips and
       the cost of production
     * The production efficiency of biomass harvest operations
     * The cost effectiveness of harvesting mountain hardwood biomass
     * Using rainfall simulations to develop management guidelines for
       erosion control under various types of conditions and ground cover

   Both graduate and undergraduate students are contributing to the body
   of knowledge in this emerging energy option. They have analyzed market
   changes in the logging community, assessed soil disturbances from
   operations, and surveyed the fuel efficiency of various harvest
   methods.

   "Our objective is to address real problems that need real solutions,"
   Bolding said. "Our research is applied and designed to serve
   practitioners engaged in forestry."

   Forestry Extension Associate [86]Scott Barrett coordinates the
   statewide SHARP (Sustainable Harvesting and Resource Professional)
   Logger Program and organizes workshops that serve about 1,000 loggers
   and foresters per year. Offerings in 2012 included workshops on biomass
   harvesting and equipment demonstrations for more than 300 attendees.

   "The new renewable energy facilities in Virginia will have the capacity
   to use over 3 million tons of biomass a year," said Barrett, who is
   also a doctoral student studying forest operations and business. "Many
   Virginia logging businesses are evaluating whether they can adapt their
   operations to use logging residues for energy. The opportunities are
   out there now."

   For his research, Barrett, of Fincastle, Va., is evaluating the
   implementation of best management practices for protecting water
   quality on biomass harvesting sites. Those include practices such as
   leaving buffers along streams and properly designing logging roads and
   skid trails to cause the least amount of erosion. They also recommend
   leaving enough woody residue on logging sites where needed to protect
   areas of bare soil.

   "We are confident that biomass harvesting can be sustainable if best
   management practices are followed," Bolding said.

   The Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation is
   helping to change the way forests are managed and harvested. As markets
   change, so do opportunities in forestry. Students, with their
   comprehensive perspective of the issues, are prepared to guide and
   participate in the emerging renewable energy industry.

Program offers training to loggers

       Scott Barrett, at right

   Since 1996, the [88]SHARP (Sustainable Harvesting and Resource
   Professional)Logger Program has trained loggers and foresters in the
   principles of sustainable forestry, environmental protection, and
   workplace safety.

   Recent efforts have focused on biomass harvesting and equipment.

   Scott Barrett, at right in photo above, coordinates the program.

Cooperative provides hands-on opportunities

       Faculty and students work with forest industry personnel to select
   research focus areas and projects to benefit the industry and prepare
   students for careers.

   Representatives from the forest industry collaborate with Virginia Tech
   in the Forest Operations and Business Research Cooperative to enhance
   undergraduate and graduate teaching programs.
