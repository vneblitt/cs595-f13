[13]Your app makes me fat

   FixedMemorization.jpg FixedMemorization.jpg

   In 1999, Professor Baba Shiv (currently at Stanford) and his co-author
   Alex Fedorikhin did a simple experiment on 165 grad students.They asked
   half to memorize a seven-digit number and the other half to memorize a
   two-digit number. After completing the memorization task, participants
   were told the experiment was over, and then offered a snack choice of
   either chocolate cake or a fruit bowl.

The participants who memorized the seven-digit number were nearly 50% more
likely than the other group to choose cake over fruit.

   Researchers were astonished by a pile of experiments that led to one
   bizarre conclusion:

Willpower and cognitive processing draw from the same pool of resources.

   Spend hours at work on a tricky design problem? Youâre more likely to
   stop at Burger King on the drive home. Hold back from saying what you
   really think during one of those long-ass, painful meetings? Youâll
   struggle with the code you write later that day.

   Since both willpower/self-control and cognitive tasks drain the same
   tank, deplete it over here, pay the price over there. One pool.  One
   pool of scarce, precious, easily-depleted resources. If you spend the
   day exercising self-control (angry customers, clueless co-workers), by
   the time you get home your cog resource tank is flashing E.

The tank is empty.

   And even if you loved solving tough puzzles at work, the drain on your
   self-control still happens. One pool. Whether the drain was from
   something you love or hate doesnât matter.

Cognitive resource tank donât care.

   You snap at the kids or dog over the tiniest thing.

   Or the dog snaps at you.

   An experiment asked one group of dogs to sit, just sit, nothing else,
   for a few minutes before being released to play with their favorite
   treat âpuzzleâ toy (the ones where the dog has to work at getting the
   treats out of it). The other group of dogs were allowed to just hang
   out in their crates before getting the treat puzzle.

   You know where this goes: the dogs that had to sit â exercising
   self-control â gave up on the puzzle much earlier than the dogs that
   were just hanging out in their crate.The dogs that were NOT burning
   cognitive resources being obedient had more determination and
   mental/emotional energy for solving the puzzle. Think about that
   next time you ask Sparky to be patient. His cognitive resources are
   easily-depleted too.

   Now think about what we're doing to our users.

   If your UX asks the user to make choices, for example, even if those
   choices are both clear and useful, the act of deciding is a cognitive
   drain. And not just while they're deciding... even after we choose, an
   unconscious cognitive background thread is slowly consuming/leaking
   resources, "Was that the right choice?"

   If your app is confusing and your tech support / FAQ isn't helpful,
   youâre drawing down my scarce, precious, cognitive resources. If your
   app behaves counter-intuitively â even just once â I'll leak cog
   resources every time I use it, forever, wondering, "wait, did that do
   what I expected?". Or let's say your app is super easy to use, but
   designed and tuned for persuasive brain hacks ("nudges", gamification,
   behavioral tricks, etc.) to keep me "engaged" for your benefit, not
   mine (lookin' at you, Zynga)... you've still drained my cognitive
   resources.

   And when I back away from the screen and walk to the kitchen...

Your app makes me fat.

   If our work drains a userâs cognitive resources, what does he lose?
   What else could he have done with those scarce, precious,
   easily-depleted resources? Maybe heâs trying to stick with that diet.
   Or practice guitar. Or play with his kids.

   That one new feature you added? That sparkly,
   Techcrunchable, awesome feature? What did it cost your user? If the
   result of your work consumes someoneâs cognitive resources, they canât
   use those resources for other things that truly, deeply matter. This is
   NOT about consuming their time and attention while they're using your
   app. This is about draining their ability for logical thinking,
   problem-solving, and willpower after the clicking/swiping/gesturing is
   done.

   Of course it's not implicitly bad if our work burns a user's cog
   resources.Your app might be the one place your user wants to spend
   those resources. But knowing that interacting with our product comes at
   a precious cost, maybe weâll make different choices.

   Maybe weâll think more about what our users really care about. Maybe
   weâll ask ourselves at each design meeting, âis this a Fruit-choosing
   feature or a Cake-choosing feature?â and weâll try to limit
   Cake-choosing featuresâthe ones that really drain them â to that which
   supports the thing they're using our app for in the first place.

   (Yes, cognitive resources can be partly replenished throughout the day
   by getting glucose to the brain, but be careful with that. A
   high-protein snack combined with small infrequent sips on a sports
   drink can help, a lot.)

   But even if we can justify consuming our user's cognitive resources
   while they're using our product, what about our marketing? Can we
   honestly believe that our "content marketing" is a good use of their
   resources? "Yes, because it adds value." we tell ourselves. But what
   does that even mean? Can we honestly say that "engaging with our brand"
   is a healthy, ethical use of their scarce, precious, limited cognitive
   resources? "Yes, because our content is useful."

   And that's all awesome and fabulous and social and 3.0ish except for
   one, small, inconvenient fact: zero sum. What you consume here, you
   take from there. Not just their attention, not just their time, but
   their ability to be the person they are when they are at their best.
   When they have ample cognitive resources. When they can think,
   solve-problems, and exercise self-control. When they can create, make
   connections, and stay focused.

   Is that "content" worth it?  Maybe. But instead of "Is this useful?"
   perhaps we should raise the bar and ask "Will they use it?" (and so,
   yeah, I'm more than a little self-conscious about typing that as I
   consume your cognitive resources. But I didn't start Serious Pony to
   save your cognitive resources; I want to help save the cognitive
   resources of your users).

   I'm not against "content marketing". On the contrary, it's nearly the
   only form of cog-resource-draining marketing that can be "worth it".
   It's the one form of marketing that can help people become better at
   something they care about. It's one form of marketing with the
   potential to deliver the user-learning so few companies care about.
   Content marketing can (and should) be "the missing manual." It can (and
   should be) the inspiration for our users to learn, get better (at the
   thing they care about), and connect with other users.

   But if it's "content" designed solely to suck people in ("7 ways to be
   OMG awesome!!")  for the chance to "convert", we're hurting people. If
   we're pumping out "content" because frequency, we're hurting people.
   I'm hurting some of you now. That's on me. It's why I try to use
   graphics to make the key point, so you don't have to read the post
   (also because I'm really rambly-aroundy, I know, workin' on it.)

   My father died unexpectedly last week, and as happens when one close to
   us dies, I had the "on their deathbed, nobody thinks..." moment. Over
   the past 20 years of my work, I've created interactive marketing games,
   gamified sites (before it was called that), and dozens of other
   projects carefully, artfully, scientifically designed to slurp (gulp)
   cognitive resources for... very little that was "worth it".  Did people
   willingly choose to engage with them? Of course. And by "of course" I
   mean, not really, no. Not according to psychology, neuroscience, and
   behavioral economics research of the past 50 years. They were
   nudged/seduced/tricked. And I was pretty good at it. I am so very, very
   sorry.

   My goal for Serious Pony is to help all of us take better care of our
   users. Not just while they are interacting with our app, site, product,
   but after. Not just because they are our users, but because they are
   people.

Because on their deathbed, our users won't be thinking,"If only I'd spent
more time engaging with brands."

   Help them conserve and manage their scarce, precious, easily-depleted
   cognitive resources for what really matters. To them. And don't forget
   to take care of your own. Think of the kids. Think of Sparky.
