From Newtown to Navy Yard, unpredictable calamities upend Obamaâs second term

   [294][ObamaFull.jpg]

   Video: President Obama addressed the nation Monday, five years after
   the 2008 financial crisis, to reflect on the nation's recovery after
   the "worst economic crisis of our lifetimes." He also commented on the
   situation in Syria and the Navy Yard shooting.

By [295]David Nakamura, E-mail the writer

   President Obama hoped to seize control of the news cycle Monday.
   Instead, [296]events overtook him and his message again.

   As reports broke of a deadly shooting rampage at the Navy Yard, three
   miles from the White House, the president was forced to alter his
   script. Over the past three weeks, his [297]muddled response to reports
   of chemical weapons use in Syria has distracted the administration from
   looming fights with Congress over the budget and debt ceiling.

   This time, Obama was forced to rewrite prepared remarks at the
   Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where he was set to talk about
   the five-year anniversary of the stock market collapse and frame the
   fiscal debates ahead.

   "We still don't know all the facts, but we do know that several people
   have been shot and some have been killed," Obama said solemnly, a
   collection of small-business owners standing awkwardly behind him on
   stage.

   They had been invited to the White House to serve as symbolic reminders
   of the impact of economic policy on ordinary Americans as the president
   launched a week of events intended as a pivot away from Syria.

   Obama delayed his remarks for more than 45 minutes to avoid conflicting
   with a live news conference with D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) and
   Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier, who briefed reporters on the scene near
   the shootings in Southeast Washington. Then, after the president
   addressed the shootings, cable television networks abruptly cut away
   and returned to the breaking coverage of rampage.

   Obama's second term has been buffeted from the start by unpredictable
   calamities that have helped scuttle his priorities. In December, [307]a
   mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., that left 26
   people dead, including 20 children, prompted the newly reelected
   president to focus on an unsuccessful attempt to pass gun-control
   legislation ahead of other priorities.

   In many ways, Obama has yet to recover from that early-second-term
   loss. Immigration reform, which was supposed to be Obama's top domestic
   priority, is stalled in the Republican-controlled House. A budget
   standoff in the spring led the White House to accept mandatory,
   across-the-board spending cuts that have forced federal agencies to
   scale back programs. And escalating violence in Egypt and Syria has led
   to renewed questions about Obama's foreign policy in the Middle East.

   White House press secretary Jay Carney declined to comment Monday on
   whether the administration might revisit its push for gun-control
   legislation in the wake of the Navy Yard shootings.

   "What is true is certainly that the president supports, as do an
   overwhelming majority of Americans, common-sense measures to reduce gun
   violence," Carney said. He noted that Obama is pursuing a list of
   smaller-scale executive actions to reduce gun violence that do not
   require Congressional approval.

   It appears unlikely that another gun-control push is in the offing
   given the press of other legislative issues. The administration is
   pushing forward with implementation of Obama's signature health-care
   law in the face of concerted Republican opposition. The president also
   must name a new chairman of the Federal Reserve after former Treasury
   Secretary Lawrence H. Summers [308]withdrew from consideration for the
   job over the weekend due to a lack of Democratic support on Capitol
   Hill.

   In his remarks on the economy, which went on for more than 3,800 words,
   Obama said: "This country has worked too hard for too long to dig out
   of a crisis just to see their elected representatives here in
   Washington purposely cause another crisis. Let's stop the threats.
   Let's stop the political posturing."
