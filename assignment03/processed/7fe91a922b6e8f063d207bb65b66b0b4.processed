 Payment Reduction Estimator

   Page Content
   Under the Home Affordable Modification Program, the target maximum
   amount for your mortgage payment (or mortgage debt-to-income) should
   be approximately 31% of your gross (pre-tax) monthly income. This
   Payment Reduction Estimator will help determine what your current
   mortgage debt-to-income is and how much your monthly payment could be
   reduced if you qualify for a modification. Based on your individual
   financial situation, under HAMP, your final modified payment may be
   above or below the 31% debt-to-income ratio.

   Do not include any payments on your second mortgage. You may have taxes
   and interest in escrow added to your monthly payment already, so be
   careful to count taxes and escrow only once.
   *This tool should be used for estimation purposes only and will not
   determine a homeowner's final eligibility for a HAMP modification.
   Payment Reduction Estimator
   Total Monthly Payment on Your First (or "primary") Mortgage. Be sure to
   INCLUDE principal, interest, taxes, insurance and homeowners
   association dues if applicable.

   Notes:
     * Enter Monthly Principal and Interest on Your Primary Mortgage Only:
       Includes the amount you are required to pay each month, even if you
       currently pay interest-only.
     * Enter Monthly Taxes: Include only the monthly amount, no matter how
       it is billed. If you pay your taxes annual, divide this amount by
       12 to get your monthly tax payment.
     * This is Your Total Monthly Housing Payment: If you know your total
       monthly housing payment for your primary mortgage, leave the above
       fields blank and enter your total monthly payment amount here.
     * Homeowner's Association Dues or Assessments: If you pay HOA dues or
       assessments once a year - divide the annual amount by 12 and enter
       that amount. If you pay quarterly - multiply the quarterly payment
       by 4 then divide by 12 and enter that amount.

   Notes:
     * Enter Your Monthly Take Home Pay (Net Income): This is the amount
       of money all borrowers who signed your mortgage (for example your
       spouse or a co-signer) are actually paid each month after taxes are
       deducted. Be sure to add the monthly net pay of all borrowers. This
       is a monthly amount so if any borrowers are paid twice a month,
       simply add those two amounts together to get that borrower's
       monthly net pay.
     * Estimated Monthly Gross Income: This is a rough estimate of the
       total monthly pay of all borrowers before any taxes are deducted.
