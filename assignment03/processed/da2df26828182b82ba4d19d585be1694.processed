   2:34 p.m. CDT, September 13, 2013

   SAN FRANCISCO --  A U.S. appeals court on Friday upheld the felony
   conviction of baseball home run king Barry Bonds for obstruction of
   justice over his testimony to a grand jury probing the sale of
   steroids.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the former San Francisco
   Giants slugger had been "evasive and misleading" when he told grand
   jurors in 2003 about his childhood in response to a question about
   whether his former trainer, Greg Anderson, had given him
   self-injectable substances.
   Bonds had been testifying under a grant of immunity, and denied
   knowingly using steroids or any performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs)
   provided by the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, known as BALCO, or by
   Anderson.
   After talking about his friendship with the trainer, Bonds, a son of
   former baseball star Bobby Bonds, had testified: "I was a celebrity
   child, not just in baseball by my own instincts. I became a celebrity
   child with a famous father. I just don't get into other people's
   business because of my father's situation."
   While Bonds eventually said he had not received self-injectable
   substances, Circuit Judge Mary Schroeder wrote for a unanimous
   three-judge appeals court panel that his response could have influenced
   the grand jury into minimizing Anderson's role in the distribution of
   illegal steroids and PEDs.
   Grand jurors had been examining whether proceeds from sales of the
   drugs were being laundered.
   "The statement served to divert the grand jury's attention away from
   the relevant inquiry of the investigation, which was Anderson and
   BALCO's distribution of steroids and PEDs," the judge wrote. "The
   statement was therefore evasive."
   In upholding Bonds' April 2011 conviction, the 9th Circuit, which heard
   the case in San Francisco, also rejected his contentions that the
   statute under which he was convicted did not apply to grand jury
   testimony and was unconstitutionally vague.
   "We are gratified by the court's decision, and believe justice is
   served," said U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag in San Francisco.
   It was unclear whether Bonds would appeal Friday's decision.
   His sentence of two years of probation and 30 days of home confinement
   was put on hold pending the appeal of his conviction. Bonds' jury had
   deadlocked on three perjury counts.
   Dennis Riordan, who argued Bonds' appeal, did not immediately respond
   to requests for comment.
   Paul Haagen, a Duke University law professor and director of its Center
   for Sports Law and Policy, said the decision to try Bonds reflected
   "increased impatience" among authorities to rely too heavily on drug
   testing to uncover and deter PED use.
   "Users are becoming more sophisticated in avoiding detection, and one
   response among sports organizations and governments has been to rely on
   investigations in addition to drug testing," he said. "This decision
   reflects that celebrities and athletes are not going to be given a
   pass."
   Bonds last played in 2007, and is Major League Baseball's regular
   season home run leader with 762. He also holds the single-season record
   with 73 in 2001, and won the National League's Most Valuable Player
   award a record seven times.
   But suspicions over drugs tarnished his legacy, and voters in January
   denied him and former star pitcher Roger Clemens entry to baseball's
   Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility.
   A jury in Washington, D.C., acquitted Clemens in June 2012 of lying to
   Congress by denying that he used PEDs. Bonds and Clemens are the most
   prominent players to have been tried in connection with baseball's
   so-called Steroid Era.
   Bonds had testified that he received flaxseed oil, creams, vitamins and
   protein shakes from Anderson.
   Among the other athletes linked to BALCO was former track star Marion
   Jones, who gave up her five medals from the 2000 Summer Olympics after
   admitting in October 2007 that she lied to federal investigators about
   whether she used PEDs.
