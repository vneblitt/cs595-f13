‚A Night at the Opera‚ Exhibition Opens at Library of Congress on Aug. 15

   The grandeur of opera‚its unforgettable music, stellar performers, and
   lavish scenery and costumes‚has transfixed audiences for more than 400
   years. The Library of Congress will celebrate the majestic art form
   with "A Night at the Opera," an exhibition opening on Aug. 15, 2013.

   The 50-item display will feature manuscript and printed scores,
   librettos, photographs, correspondence and set designs, dating from the
   late 18th century through the beginning of the 20th century. The
   exhibition will highlight the diversity and breadth of the opera
   holdings in the Music Division at the Library of Congress.

   "A Night at the Opera" will open on Thursday, Aug. 15, 2013 in the
   Performing Arts Reading Room Gallery on the first floor of the
   Library‚s James Madison Building, 101 Independence Ave. S.E.,
   Washington D.C., and will be on view through Saturday, Jan. 25, 2014.
   The exhibition is free and open to the public from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30
   p.m., Monday through Saturday.

   Afterward, the exhibition will travel to Los Angeles, opening at the
   Walt Disney Concert Hall in the Library of Congress Ira Gershwin
   Gallery, on Monday, Feb. 24, 2014, and running through Sunday, Aug. 17,
   2014.

   "A Night at the Opera" also will commemorate the bicentennials of
   iconic opera composers Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner, both born in
   1813. Highlights include holograph manuscript (in the composer‚s own
   handwriting) scores by Verdi and Wagner, as well as extremely rare
   librettos from the premiere performances of Verdi‚s "Aida" (Cairo,
   1871) and Wagner‚s "Lohengrin" (Weimar, 1850). Other items include
   early printed scores of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart‚s "Don Giovanni" and
   Verdi‚s "Macbeth" with evocative illustrated title pages.

   The exhibition will feature a number of items on display for the first
   time, including set designs for "Don Giovanni" and Georges Bizet‚s
   "Carmen" by Oliver Smith (1918-1994) and a colorful set design by
   Italian Art Nouveau artist Galileo Chini (1873-1956), created for the
   first production of Giacomo Puccini‚s "Turandot" at the Teatro alla
   Scala in Milan in 1926.

   In addition, there will be a number of photographs of celebrated opera
   stars costumed for some of their most notable roles. Among them will be
   Enrico Caruso (1873-1921), Lauritz Melchior (1890-1973), Alexander
   Kipnis (1891-1978), Rosa Ponselle (1897-1981), Lily Pons (1898-1976)
   and Regina Resnik (born 1922).

   An audiovisual program featuring opera-themed live action and cartoon
   excerpts from television and movies in the 1940s and ‚50s will
   complement the exhibition objects.

   "A Night at the Opera" is made possible through the sponsorship of the
   Library‚s Music Division and the generous support of The Ira and
   Leonore Gershwin Trust for the benefit of the Library of Congress. The
   exhibition curators from the Music Division are Raymond A. White and
   James E. Wintle. The exhibition director from the Library‚s
   Interpretive Programs Office is Martha Hopkins.

   The Music Division, with more than 21 million items, holds the world's
   largest music collection. Particular areas of strength include opera
   (scores and librettos), stage and screen musicals, chamber music, jazz
   and American popular song. The Music Division is home to approximately
   600 archival collections, most of them the personal papers (including
   music scores as well as correspondence, photographs, legal and
   financial documents, programs, clippings and other materials)
   documenting the lives and careers of stellar composers and performers.
   As well, the Music Division holds a significant and growing body of
   materials documenting dance and theater. For more information, visit
