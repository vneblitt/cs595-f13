   Making Sense," plus an evening of the popular musical genre on
   television, selected from the Library‚s vast video collections housed
   at the Packard Campus.

Series Schedule

   Thursday, Sept. 5 (7:30 p.m.)
   1933 DOUBLE FEATURE
   "Picture Snatcher" (Warner Bros., 1933)
   James Cagney stars as Danny Kean, a brash Lower East Side ex-con who
   decides to go legit. He finds his criminal skills perfectly suited to
   the barely legal antics of a sleazy tabloid newspaper where he becomes
   the ace "picture snatcher." Lloyd Bacon directed the snappy
   crime-drama, which was reportedly inspired by
   newspaperman-turned-screenwriter Ben Hecht‚s early career. The Library
   of Congress Packard Campus Film Preservation Laboratory made the new
   screening print.

   "The Little Giant" (First National, 1933)
   Edward G. Robinson spoofs his own gangster persona in this comedy,
   directed by Roy Del Ruth, in which he plays a bootlegger who tries to
   break into high society after Prohibition ends. Mary Astor provides the
   classy love interest in this lightning-paced send-up of gangster
   movies. The Library of Congress Packard Campus film preservation lab
   developed the new screening print.

   Friday, Sept. 6 (7:30 p.m.)
   "School of Rock" (Paramount, 2003)
   Fired from his band and hard up for cash, rock guitarist and vocalist
   Dewey Finn (Jack Black) wangles his way into a job as a fourth-grade
   substitute teacher at a private school. Soon, his free-living lifestyle
   influences the students to explore sides of themselves that the school
   doesn‚t encourage. Joan Cusack and Sarah Silverman co-star in this
   critically acclaimed comedy, directed by Richard Linklater.

   Saturday, Sept. 7 (7:30 p.m.)
   "Stop Making Sense" (Cinecom, 1984)
   Director Jonathan Demme expertly crafted this unrivaled concert film
   from footage of three live gigs at Hollywood‚s Pantages Theatre. The
   staging concept‚the brainchild of Talking Heads front man David
   Byrne‚begins with the lead vocalist striding onto an empty stage,
   acoustic guitar and boom box in hand. With each new tune, another band
   member or backup singer joins Byrne onstage, building steadily toward
   the finale.

   Thursday, Sept. 12 (7:30 p.m.)
   "Music to Look At: An Evening of Music Videos" (1980s)
   Selections of iconic music videos reaching from the early days of MTV
   to the recent past will highlight the video form‚s most memorable,
   influential, innovative and, at times, controversial examples, with a
   special emphasis on resonating images, themes and affectionate
   nostalgia. Featured, among others, will be videos by Madonna, Devo,
   Duran Duran, Talking Heads, REM, Lady Gaga and Nirvana, whose 1991
   album "Nevermind" was added to the National Recording Registry in 2004.

   Friday, Sept. 13 (7:30 p.m.)
   "Stand and Deliver" (Warner Bros., 1988)
   East Los Angeles math teacher Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos)
   finds himself in a classroom of rebellious remedial students. Escalante
   stuns fellow faculty members with his plans to teach the kids advanced
   placement calculus. However, no one expects the mostly Hispanic teens
   (including Lou Diamond Phillips) to overcome the odds. Ram√≥n Men√©ndez
   directed this moving, mostly true story. "Stand and Deliver" was named
   to the National Film Registry in 2011.

   Saturday, Sept. 14 (2 p.m.)
   "The Indian in the Cupboard" (Columbia, 1995)
   A boy receives an old cupboard as a birthday present and finds that
   when he puts a plastic Indian inside and turns the key, the Indian
   comes to life. He learns that the Indian is not a toy, but a real
   person. Complications arise, especially when his best friend conjures
   up a real-life cowboy. Frank Oz directed this family sci-fi fantasy
   that stars Hal Scardino, Lightfoot, Lindsay Crouse and Richard Jenkins.

   Saturday, Sept. 14 (7:30 p.m.)
   "Mike and Mark at the Mike: Celebrating Comedy on the National
   Recording Registry" (Live)
   Popular standup comedians Mike Diesel and Mark Matusof will appear in a
   live performance on the Packard Campus stage. Cary O'Dell, National
   Recording Registry Board assistant and TV historian, will host the
   evening. The program will also feature a presentation by stand-up
   comedy expert Dan Blazek about comedy recordings selected for the
   National Recording Registry.

   "High School Confidential" (MGM, 1958)

   on young minds in this campy classic that centers on the escapades of
   tough-talking teen Tony Baker (Russ Tamblyn), who quickly works his way
   into the dope scene of his new high school. The cast of this
   entertaining morality tale includes Jackie Coogan, John Drew Barrymore,
   Mamie Van Doren and Jerry Lee Lewis as himself.

   Saturday, Sept. 21 (7:30 p.m.)
   "The Freshman" (Path√©, 1925)
   One of silent-film comedian Harold Lloyd‚s best-remembered features
   casts him as a collegiate patsy who will do anything to be popular on
   campus, unaware that everyone is making fun of him. The football game
   finale is one of several comic highlights. Directed by Sam Taylor, the
   film was added to the National Film Registry in 1990. Andrew Simpson
   will provide live musical accompaniment.

   Thursday, Sept. 26 (7:30 p.m.)
   "Up the Down Staircase" (Warner Bros., 1967)
