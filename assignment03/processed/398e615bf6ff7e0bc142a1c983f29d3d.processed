Identity Crisis: A Booklist For Teens by Andrea Lipinski, Kingsbridge Library

   As your summer vacation ends and the new school year begins, it's time
   to consider: Who are you? Who are you now, who do you want to be, and
   will you/can you/SHOULD you try to reinvent yourself?

   Here's a list of twenty fiction books for teens that deal with the
   topic of identity, from realistic fiction to fantastic fiction and
   beyond.

   [127]Being Henry David by Cal Armistead
   A boy wakes up in Penn Station. He has no memory of how he got there,
   how he got his head injury, or even his own name. His only possessions
   appear to be a ten-dollar bill and a copy of Walden by Henry David
   Thoreau.

   [128]You Look Different in Real Life by Jennifer Castle
   Every five years, five children were filmed for a documentary about
   their lives. Now that Justine is a 16-year-old celebrity, she's
   reluctant to film the next installment and let the public back into her
   life.

   [129]Bitter Melon by Cara Chow
   Frances' mother expects her to get into Berkeley and become a doctor.
   But when a scheduling mixup puts Frances in a speech class instead of
   calculus, she discovers a new talent and starts to question the future
   her mother imagined.

   [130]Beta by Rachel Cohn
   Elysia has been having feelings and memories that she's definitely not
   supposed to have. Maybe the scientists were right about teenage clones
   being too unstable.

   [131]The Face on the Milk Carton by Caroline Cooney
   When Janie sees a picture of a child who was kidnapped over a decade
   earlier, she is astonished to recognize herself.

   [132]Beauty by Lisa Daily
   Molly is a frizzy, ugly mess until a mysterious artist sketches her
   picture at the town fair and the next day she wakes up looking
   impossibly beautiful.

   [133]Someone Else's Life by Katie Dale
   After Rosie's mother dies, Rosie learns that she was switched with
   another baby at birth and that her whole life was based on a lie.

   [134]What Happened to Goodbye by Sarah Dessen
   Each time she and her father move to a new town, McLean reinvents
   herself with a new personality at each school. When she decides to try
   to put down roots and make friends in Lakeview, how will she know if
   these kids like the "real" her?

   [135]The Lost Code by Kevin Emerson
   Owen has no idea that he's anything but ordinary until he survives a
   drowning that should have killed him.

   [136]How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity edited by
   Michael Cart
   Twelve different authors share stories about such life-changing topics
   as love, death, happiness, gender, and sexuality.

   [137]Openly Straight by Bill Konigsberg
   Rafe sees his new school as a place to start over and lead a label-free
   life. Instead of being known as "that gay guy," he just wants people to
   treat him like a regular guy, which in this case means straight.

   [138]You Don't Know Me by David Klass
   If I had one wish, it would be that the next time you looked at me, you
   would look into my eyes and finally see who I really am.

   [139]The Host by Stephenie Meyer
   An alien species has invaded earth, and each one is living inside a
   human host. But Melanie's mind is fighting back against the alien
   inside her.

   [140]The Adoration of Jenna Fox by Mary E. Pearson
   After Jenna wakes up from a coma, she finds it hard to remember
   anything that happened before her accident.

   [141]Mexican Whiteboy by Matt de la Pena
   Danny Lopez's father is Mexican and his mother has blonde hair and blue
   eyes, so he never quite fits in. If he goes to Mexico to find his
   roots, will he also be able to find himself?

   [142]Permanent Record by Leslie Stella
   An Iranian-American teenager struggles with pressures at school, even
   though his father gave him a new name to make it "easier" for him to
   fit in.

   [143]The Wave by Todd Strasser
   In this novel based on a true story, a history teacher conducts a
   classroom experiment about the Nazi movement and the power of group
   pressure.

   [144]Slated by Teri Terry
   Can you know the truth if your memory has been erased? Kyla is sixteen
   years old, and she's being released from the hospital after nine
   months. She doesn't remember anything that happened before that.

   [145]Uglies by Scott Westerfeld
   Tally lives in a world where everyone is "ugly" until they turn
   sixteen, when they go under the knife and are magically transformed
   into "pretties."

   [146]Sweethearts by Sara Zarr
   Years ago, Jennifer and Cameron used to be best friends. Now "Jenna"
   has transformed herself into someone pretty and popular, and when
   Cameron comes back into her life they both have to deal with how and
   why their lives changed.
