   BLACKSBURG, Va., Jan. 28, 2013 - Sean Hemp of Raleigh, N.C., a Ph.D.
   student in chemistry in the [160]College of Science, is helping to
   invent new therapies that target genetic disease and cancer.

   Working with [161]Timothy Long, professor of chemistry in the College
   of Science and part of the Virginia Tech [162]Center for Drug
   Discovery, Hemp creates polymers to deliver nucleic acid -- the
   molecules that carry genetic information within DNA and RNA.

   "Sean exemplifies a genuine inventor. He has an unbridled passion
   coupled with keen intellect and infectious curiosity," said Long.

   Delivering foreign DNA and RNA to the body is difficult, but can serve
   several health benefits, especially in the case of genetic disease and
   cancer, according to Hemp. Effective uptake of nucleic acids allows for
   the delivery of genetic code that may correct malfunctioning DNA or
   eliminate mutating cells, such as cancer.

   "The body's natural defense system quickly detects naked DNA or RNA and
   eliminates them," said Hemp.  "Polymers are an important part of
   delivering the nucleic acid and targeting only cancerous cells."

   Collaborating with a local biotech company, Techulon, Hemp is
   developing a phosphonium-based polymer for the delivery of nucleic
   acid. Phosphonium groups are positively charged and the nucleic acids
   are negatively charged, so the two electrostatically bind to produce a
   nanoparticle. This process creates a capsule in which the nucleic acid
   is protected by the polymer. After this binding occurs, the
   nanoparticle remains positively charged, making it more likely for
   cellular uptake since the cellular wall is negative.

   However, a major challenge in drug delivery is avoiding damage to
   healthy cells.

   "Most cancer therapeutics are pretty indiscriminate. They harm all
   cells, not just cancer cells. That's why someone undergoing
   chemotherapy can lose their hair," said Hemp. "The addition of
   targeting groups to the nanoparticles enables the selective treatment
   of cancer cells over healthy cells."

   The cancer's rapid growth makes its vulnerable. The rapidly growing
   cells need nutrients and the inclusion of these nutrients as part of
   the weaponized nanoparticle allows researchers like Hemp to target only
   cancerous cells.

   In trial studies, Hemp's team has been able to show the phosphonium
   polymer successfully delivers nucleic acid in a test tube. Working with
   Techulon, he translates this knowledge into application by preparing
   that polymer for in-vivo use.

   Hemp has co-authored two papers which support these findings in
   Biomacromolecules journal: "[163]Phosphonium-Containing Diblock
   Copolymers for Enhanced Colloidal Stability and Efficient Nucleic Acid
   Delivery" and "[164]Phosphonium-Containing Polyelectrolytes for
   Nonviral Gene Delivery."

   "The hope is to create the polymer. Once the drug delivery vehicle is
   there, researchers can change the nucleic acid and specifically tailor
   it to the type of cancer they are treating," said Hemp.

   "Sean will surely invent the future," Long said. "His discoveries in
   siRNA delivery with serum stable vectors offers the chance to
   understand cancer treatment using unprecedented phosphorous-containing
   molecular structure."

   community through strategic investments that are often allied with
