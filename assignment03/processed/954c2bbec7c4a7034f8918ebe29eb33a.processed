August is the month when members of Congress leave Washington to spend time
in their home districts. It‚s a chance for lawmakers to hear directly from
the people they represent, and it‚s a critical time to make your voice heard
on the issues you care most about.

   to ensure a successful event
     * [14]Blizzarding Host Guide
       ‚Blizzarding‚ means Ô¨yering or delivering postcards to help bring
       an important issue to the attention of more people and lawmakers in
       your community.
     * [15]House Meetings Guide
       No matter which issues you care about and what action you take,
       you‚ll be more effective‚and have more fun‚when you get local
       supporters to take part with you. Often the best way to start is
       with a house meeting, where you can invite people who are
       interested in learning more about a topic, brainstorm plans
       together, and get firm commitments from people who are interested
       in taking action.
     * [16]Organizing an Issue Advocacy Event
       Choose a date, time, and location for your event, and create an
       online listing.
     * [17]Writing Letters to the Editor
       A letter to the editor is a short letter to a local newspaper or
       publication that gives your opinion on an issue and calls on your
       lawmakers or fellow community members to take action.
     * [18]‚Pledge to Call‚ Drives
       Any lawmaker will tell you that the biggest factor in the decisions
       they make is what their constituents care about and are requesting
       of them. Congressional representatives and Senators receive dozens
       and sometimes hundreds of calls and letters to their offices daily,
       urging them to support or oppose issues being debated in Congress.
       Use this guide to organize local supporters to contact their
       lawmakers on the issues you care most about.
     * [19]Sign On Guide
       Petitions are one of the best and easiest ways to raise awareness
       and build support for an issue in your community. Download this pdf
       for a few tips and tricks for successful petition signature
       gathering.

   you get your guest to pick up‚leave a message if you have to, but tell
   them in your message when you'll call back.

Fact Sheets

     * [26]Comprehensive Immigration Reform Fact Sheet
       Immigration has always been a part of the American story. We are a
       nation of immigrants, but also a nation of laws. For too long, our
       immigration system has been broken‚11 million undocumented
       immigrants live in constant uncertainty outside the system,
       employers are free to exploit the system, and our broken system
       can‚t keep up with the demands of our economic growth. Now, we have
       a historic chance to fix all of that.
     * [27]Obamacare Fact Sheet
       The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, builds on what works in our
       health care system and fixes what is broken. The law, which
       President Obama signed on March 23, 2010, puts in place
       comprehensive reforms that improve access to affordable health
       coverage. It gets rid of the worst insurance industry practices.
       Fundamentally, it puts families first and gives them a more secure
       future.
     * [28]President Obama's Climate Plan
       President Obama has said that we must respond to the threat of
       climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our
       children and future generations. He called on Congress to take
       action, but made it clear that if they won‚t act, he will.
     * [29]Gun Violence Prevention Fact Sheet
       Background checks are the only systematic way to stop felons,
       domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill from buying
       firearms.
     * [30]Economy Fact Sheet
       While congress delays and engages in petty political games,
       President Obama has pledged to do everything in his powers to keep
       the country moving forward on the economic issues that matter most
       to middle-class americans: creating new, quality jobs right here at
       home and providing the security that allows families to plan for
       their futures and pass on a stronger country for their children.
