Healthy Aging Your Way

   Every generation puts its own spin on the aging process, and how you
   approach your 50s, 60s, 70s and beyond is different than the way your
   parents did. This September during Healthy Aging Month, find the latest
   government information to help you improve your physical, mental and
   financial health:

Staying in the pink

   Get a group of friends together, and the subject eventually turns to
   health, from managing medications to getting more physically active.
   Use the [56]Go4Life website from the National Institute on Aging for
   helpful tips, encouraging success stories and modern, realistic fitness
   plans to build your strength, flexibility and endurance. And visit
   WomensHealth.gov's [57]Healthy Aging section for suggestions on
   handling age-related health challenges, from treating osteoporosis and
   caring for aging skin to preventing falls and understanding drug
   labels.

More than just "the blues"

   Depression can take away your enthusiasm for the things and people you
   care about. It can creep in if you live with constant physical pain,
   are grieving a loved one or are facing the loss of your independence.
   And it can be conquered. [58]Learn how getting evaluated and treated by
   your doctor can help you get back to feeling like yourself again.

Chasing the pot of gold

   Scammers never seem to run out of tricks. They offer fake health cures
   for arthritis or try to talk you into medical equipment you don't need.
   You might get high pressure phone calls urging you to give to a
   questionable charity or to try to get you to agree to a reverse
   mortgage or investment scheme. But you don't have to be anybody's
   victim. With the FBI's extensive [59]list of scams that target seniors,
   you can empower yourself to recognize and steer clear of con artists.

   For tips on managing your money, getting government benefits and
   services, volunteering in your community, grandparenting and more,
   visit our special [60]Senior Citizens' Resources section.
