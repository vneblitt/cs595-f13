Food waste harms climate, water, land and biodiversity â new FAO report

Direct economic costs of $750 billion annually â Better policies required,
and âsuccess storiesâ need to be scaled up and replicated

   In France, food waste waits to be converted into methane and biogas.

   11 September 2013, Rome - The waste of a staggering 1.3 billion tonnes
   of food per year is not only causing major economic losses but also
   wreaking significant harm on the natural resources that humanity relies
   upon to feed itself, says a new FAO report.
   [27]Food Wastage Footprint: Impacts on Natural Resources is the first
   study to analyze the impacts of global food wastage from an
   environmental perspective, looking specifically at its consequences for
   the climate, water and land use, and biodiversity.
   Among its key findings: Each year, food that is produced but not eaten
   guzzles up a volume of water equivalent to the annual flow of Russia's
   Volga River and is responsible for adding 3.3 billion tonnes of
   greenhouse gases to the planet's atmosphere.
   And beyond its environmental impacts, the direct economic consequences
   to producers of food wastage (excluding fish and seafood) run to the
   tune of $750 billion annually, FAO's report estimates.
   "All of us - farmers and fishers; food processors and supermarkets;
   local and national governments; individual consumers -- must make
   changes at every link of the human food chain to prevent food wastage
   from happening in the first place, and re-use or recycle it when we
   can't," said FAO Director-General JosÃ© Graziano da Silva.
   "We simply cannot allow one-third of all the food we produce to go to
   waste or be lost because of inappropriate practices, when 870 million
   people go hungry every day," he added.
   As a companion to its new study, FAO has also published a comprehensive
   [28]"tool-kit" that contains recommendations on how food loss and waste
   can be reduced at every stage of the food chain.
   The tool-kit profiles a number of projects around the world that show
   how national and local governments, farmers, businesses, and individual
   consumers can take steps to tackle the problem.
   Achim Steiner, UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director,
   said: "UNEP and FAO have identified food waste and loss --food
   wastage-- as a major opportunity for economies everywhere to assist in
   a transition towards a low carbon, resource efficient and inclusive
   Green Economy. Today's excellent report by FAO underlines the multiple
   benefits that can be realized-- in many cases through simple and
   thoughtful measures by for example households, retailers, restaurants,
   schools and businesses-- that can contribute to environmental
   sustainability, economic improvements, food security and the
   realization of the UN Secretary General's Zero Hunger Challenge. We
   would urge everyone to adopt the motto of our joint campaign: Think Eat
   Save - Reduce Your Foodprint!".

   UNEP and FAO are founding partners of the [29]Think Eat Save - Reduce
   Your Foodprint campaign that was launched earlier in the year and whose
   aim is to assist in coordinating worldwide efforts to manage down
   wastage.
   Where wastage happens
   Fifty-four percent of the world's food wastage occurs "upstream" during
   production, post-harvest handling and storage, according to FAO's
   study. Forty-six percent of it happens "downstream," at the processing,
   distribution and consumption stages.
   As a general trend, developing countries suffer more food losses during
   agricultural production, while food waste at the retail and consumer
   level tends to be higher in middle- and high-income regions -- where it
   accounts for 31-39 percent of total wastage -- than in low-income
   regions (4-16 percent).
   The later a food product is lost along the chain, the greater the
   environmental consequences, FAO's report notes, since the environmental
   costs incurred during processing, transport, storage and cooking must
   be added to the initial production costs.
   Hot spots
   Several world food wastage "hot-spots" stand out in the study:
   Wastage of cereals in Asia is a significant problem, with major impacts
   on carbon emissions and water and land use. Rice's profile is
   particularly noticeable, given its high methane emissions combined with
   a large level of wastage.
   While meat wastage volumes in all world regions is comparatively low,
   the meat sector generates a substantial impact on the environment in
   terms of land occupation and carbon footprint, especially in
   high-income countries and Latin America, which in combination account
   for 80 percent of all meat wastage. Excluding Latin America,
   high-income regions are responsible for about 67 percent of all meat
   wastage
   Fruit wastage contributes significantly to water waste in Asia, Latin
   America, and Europe, mainly as a result of extremely high wastage
   levels.
   Similarly, large volumes of vegetable wastage in industrialized Asia,
   Europe, and South and South East Asia translates into a large carbon
   footprint for that sector.
   Causes of food wastage - and options for addressing them
   A combination of consumer behavior and lack of communication in the
   supply chain underlies the higher levels of food waste in affluent
   societies, according to FAO. Consumers fail to plan their shopping,
   overpurchase, or over-react to "best-before-dates," while quality and
   aesthetic standards lead retailers to reject large amounts of perfectly
   edible food.
   In developing countries, significant post-harvest losses in the early
   part of the supply chain are a key problem, occurring as a result of
   financial and structural limitations in harvesting techniques and
   storage and transport infrastructure, combined with climatic conditions
   favorable to food spoilage.
   To tackle the problem, FAO's toolkit details three general levels where
   action is needed:
   High priority should be given to reducing food wastage in the first
   place. Beyond improving losses of crops on farms due to poor practices,
   doing more to better balance production with demand would mean not
   using natural resources to produce unneeded food in the first place.
   In the event of a food surplus, re-use within the human food chain--
   finding secondary markets or donating extra food to feed vulnerable
   members of society-- represents the best option. If the food is not fit
   for human consumption, the next best option is to divert it for
   livestock feed, conserving resources that would otherwise be used to
   produce commercial feedstuff.
   Where re-use is not possible, recycling and recovery should be pursued:
   by-product recycling, anaerobic digestion, compositing, and
   incineration with energy recovery allow energy and nutrients to be
   recovered from food waste, representing a significant advantage over
   dumping it in landfills. Uneaten food that ends up rotting in landfills
   is a large producer of methane, a particularly harmful GHG.
   Funding for the Food Wastage Footprint report and toolkit was provided
   by the government of Germany.

   What is food wastage?

   Food loss is the unintended reduction in food available for human
   consumption, resulting from inefficiencies in supply chains: poor
   infrastructure and logistics or lack of technology, insufficient skills
   or poor management capacity. It mainly occurs during production or
   postharvest processing, e.g. when crops go unharvested or produce is
   thrown out during processing, storage or transport.

   Food waste refers to intentional discards of edible items, mainly by
   retailers and consumers, and is due to the behavior of businesses and
   individuals.

   The term food wastage refers to the two in combination.
