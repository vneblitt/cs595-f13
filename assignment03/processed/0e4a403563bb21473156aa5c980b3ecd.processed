   FORT WORTH -- Friends say Aaron Alexis regularly meditated at a local
   Buddhist temple, was unfailingly courteous and never showed signs of
   the violence that is now his legacy.

   But police reports paint a darker picture of the Fort Worth man,
   including an anger-fueled "blackout" and [233]shooting in Seattle in
   2004 and, more recently, [234]a firearms incident at a Fort Worth
   apartment, after which a neighbor told police that she was "terrified"
   of him.

   One friend said that Alexis, a [235]former electrician's mate in the
   Navy, was upset with the government because of a dispute over benefits.

   On Tuesday, The Associated Press reported that [236]Alexis had been
   suffering serious mental health issues, including paranoia and a sleep
   disorder. The AP, citing information from unnamed U.S. law enforcement
   officials, said Alexis had been treated since August by the Veterans
   Administration for mental problems, which including hearing voices.

   Alexis, 34, is accused of [237]opening fire on workers at the
   Washington Navy Yard on Monday. Twelve people were killed and several
   others wounded before Alexis was fatally shot.

   Authorities said they have not established a motive for the shooting.

   "I don't think he'd do this," said Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, who
   described himself as Alexis' "best friend" and roommate for three
   years.

   "He has a gun, but I don't think he's that stupid," [238]said
   Suthamtewakul, owner of Happy Bowl Thai in White Settlement, where
   Alexis also worked as a waiter at times. "He didn't seem aggressive to
   me."

   Alexis was arrested by Seattle police in 2004 after shooting out two
   tires of a car parked next door to his home. He told authorities that
   construction workers had "disrespected him."

   He also told police that he had blacked out and didn't remember the
   shooting until hours later, according to a police report [239]posted by
   the Seattle Times.

   The Fort Worth incident happened in September 2010. Alexis was arrested
   after shooting a hole through the floor of a woman's apartment.

   The woman, who was not identified, told police that Alexis had
   confronted her in a parking lot a few days earlier about making too
   much noise and that she felt the shooting was intentional.

   He said the gun had discharged while he was cleaning it, and he was
   never formally charged in the case.

   Alexis was in the Navy from 2007 to 2011 and was most recently
   stationed at Naval Air Station Fort Worth, according to Lt. Cmdr. Sarah
   Blansett, a Navy spokeswoman in McLean, Va.

   He was a petty officer 3rd class in the Navy Reserve's Fleet Logistics
   Support Squadron 46, according to the Navy.

   One Navy official [240]told The Washington Post that Alexis was
   discharged for "a pattern of misconduct," which included the 2010 gun
   incident in Fort Worth.

   Friends said he left the Navy because he didn't like to get up early
   and had complained about being underpaid.

   "But I don't think that's a reason to kill people," Suthamtewakul said.

   `Always very polite'

   Alexis had recently visited Thailand and had been to Japan with a
   computer defense contractor, where he worked in information technology,
   said Sandy Guerra-Cline, a regular customer at Happy Bowl.

   "He is not a guy that talked about guns or talked about anything
   violent," said Guerra-Cline, who works in the Star-Telegram newsroom.
   "As a matter of fact, my best memories of him were of him sitting at
   one of the tables at Happy Bowl trying to teach himself Thai."

   Alexis most recently rented a small house near [241]White Settlement
   Road and Cherry Lane in Fort Worth, but he had not lived there for six
   to eight months, said his landlord, Somsak Srisan.

   "Oh boy, I can't believe this," Srisan said. "He was always very polite
   to me."

   Srisan said he believed Alexis lived alone at the modest house in west
   Fort Worth.

   "When he lived at my house, I never saw him get angry about anything,"
   Srisan said. "My feeling is, if he was angry about anything, he didn't
   show that to me."

   He saw Alexis meditate and said he always remained calm around him.

   "I can't believe he would do anything like this," Srisan said. "He
   always behaved well around me."

   Alexis also stayed with Nutpisit Suthamtewakul and his wife, Kristi.

   She said Alexis, as a civilian contractor, was upset with the
   government over some sort of dispute concerning benefits.

   She said she didn't know much more about it because "Aaron is a very
   private person."

   She said that when he lived with her and her husband, he would become
   upset when he could not pay his share of the utilities.

   She also said Alexis held a concealed handgun license, and when he
   helped out at the restaurant, she knew he was carrying a pistol.

   "You wouldn't know it," she said. "His shirt was down over it."

   Kristi Suthamtewakul said that Alexis moved out about five months ago
   and that she hadn't seen him since.

   She showed a photo of Alexis taken at Christmas in which he's smiling
   and wearing a watch cap.

   Mike Ritrovato, another friend, said Alexis was an "easygoing guy" who
   liked to play "shoot-em-up" video games. He said that Alexis bragged
   about his shooting skills but that he had never seen him with a gun.

   Ritraovato, who was at Happy Bowl on Monday, said he has not seen
   Alexis for about five to six months.

   Arrested in Seattle

   In 2004, Alexis was living in Seattle with his grandmother.

   On May 6, two construction workers watched as Alexis walked out of the
   home, pulled a handgun from his waistband and fired three times into
   the rear tires of a parked Honda Accord.

   The car was owned by a construction worker, according to a police
   report.

   Alexis told police that workers had "mocked" and "disrespected him,"
   according to a Seattle police report.

   Alexis told police that he had an anger-fueled "blackout."

   His father told police that his son was in New York on 9-11 and had
   participated in rescue attempts, according to the police report.

   The father said family members believed that Alexis had
   anger-management issues related to PTSD.

   On Monday, Alexis' family said in a statement: "Our hearts go out to
   you. We apologize for the inconvenience of losing a loved one. We also
   lost a loved one."

   `Terrified' of Alexis

   Some six years later, in Fort Worth, police were called to The Orion
   Oak Hills apartments on a report that someone had fired a shot through
   the floor of a woman's apartment.

   She told police that Alexis, who lived beneath her, had called police
   on her several times in the past for "being loud."

   The woman told police that she was "terrified" of Alexis.

   "He said that he was trying to clean his gun while cooking and that his
   hands were slippery. He told me that he began to take the gun apart
   when his hands slipped and pulled the trigger, discharging a round into
   the ceiling," the police report states.

   Police arrested Alexis on suspicion of discharging a firearm in a
   municipality, a Class A misdemeanor.

   "After reviewing the facts presented by the police department, it was
   determined that the elements constituting recklessness under Texas law
   were not present and a case was not filed," said Melody McDonald, a
   spokeswoman with the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office.

   The Orion at Oak Hill apartments in Fort Worth began eviction efforts
   against Alexis later in September 2010. Records show that he moved from
   the Oak Hill apartments in December 2010.

   Staff writers Bill Hanna and Bud Kennedy contributed to this report.
