Adams Defends the
Mutineers

   [13]Brief in the Amistad Case
   John Quincy Adams (1767-1848)
   [14]Brief in the Amistad Case
   Autograph notes,
   [February 24 and March 1, 1841]
   [15]Manuscript Division

   After fifty-three African captives aboard the Spanish schooner Amistad
   mutinied off the coast of Cuba in 1839, killing the captain and cook,
   they tried to sail the vessel back to Africa. Captured off Long Island,
   their return was demanded by the Spanish government. Former president
   John Quincy Adams argued their case before the Supreme Court in 1841,
   and largely through his efforts, the captives were freed and permitted
   to return to Africa. Adams's legal brief, "extraordinary for its power"
   in the words of Justice Joseph Story, was widely circulated in print
   and became a milestone in the abolitionist cause.
