   [127]For the love of books; the adventures of an impecunious
   collector.,For the love of books., Digital ID 1103855, New York Public
   Library I was inspired to write this blog from my terrific experience
   with booktv.org. I very much enjoy watching and listening to authors
   describe their research and conclusions that they have metamorphosed
   into works of literature.

   BookTV is featured on CSPAN2 (Channel 66 in my neighborhood) on
   weekends, if you have cable TV. It features authors of nonfiction works
   being interviewed about their books. Following the interview, the floor
   is opened up to audience questions. One weekend, I was delighted to
   discover that they have a web site. It got me to thinking about what
   other great web sites are out there that the bibliophile world may have
   yet to discover. The following is a list of websites that you might
   find interesting.

   [128]American Booksellers Association
   This is a professional association of people who sell books, including
   publishing houses.

   [129]Brooklyn Book Festival
   This event is happening in September 2013.

   of the sessions at the Book Expo America conference in NYC in 2013.

   [136]Book TV
   This is on C-Span 2, Channel 66 in the Bronx. I have seen some terrific
   author interviews on this channel which have inspired me to make
   recommendations to others, and I read some of the books that I see
   featured myself.

   [137]Booktalk.org
   This is a free book discussion group.

   [138]Center for Book Arts
   The organization seeks to preserve books as art objects, since many
   books have awesome art on the covers and interior pages.

   This museum features a multitude of picture book art, including
   illustrations from the famous picture book called [140]The Very Hungry
   Caterpillar.

   You can find great legal resources here, including case law and
   lawyers.

   the ebooks.

   I found out that the longest line of horses consisted of 105 horses
   connected by harnesses. The record was made in 2004.
