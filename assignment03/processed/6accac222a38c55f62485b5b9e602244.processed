Legacies of leadership

PBHA summer campers rise through ranks, give back to their communities

   September 4, 2013 | Editor's Pick
   605

   Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer

   For the past two years, Jorge Santana has directed the Mission Hill
   Summer Program, a camp he attended when he was 13. Now a junior at
   Boston University, Santana is the first non-Harvard student to be
   elected an official of the Phillips Brooks House Association.
   By Jennifer Doody, Harvard Correspondent

   Dorchester native Bria Dubose was just 14 when she began working at
   Harvard as a junior counselor at the [83]Phillips Brooks House
   Association's (PBHA) Franklin Hill/Franklin Field Camp.

   Dubose recalled that she had just entered her freshman year of high
   school when she accepted the junior counselor position at the day camp,
   which is part of the PBHA [84]Summer Urban Program. "I had no idea
   about PBHA, and never would have thought that I could have the chance
   to be part of Harvard," she said. "It changed my perspective
   completely."

   That transformative opportunity repeated itself as Dubose returned to
   the camps in successive summers, working her way from junior to senior
   counselor. The 12 camps, held at sites across Boston and Cambridge, are
   run by more than 150 high school and college students. This year, the
   Summer Urban Program served more than 800 area campers, ages 6 to 13.

   Now a sophomore at [85]Lesley University, Dubose served as one of the
   directors for PBHA's Leaders! program this summer. The program strives
   to empower the almost 100 low-income Boston and Cambridge youth between
   15 and 18 years old who are employed by the camps as junior counselors
   to serve children and young teens in their own communities.

   Counselors receive full-time teaching and mentoring for the camps'
   10-week program. In addition, they receive full access to the
   University, including its libraries; mentoring; and leadership
   development during the school year -- as well as paychecks.

   "It's not a job that you can just walk into," Dubose said, but "the
   training they give us has definite real-life applications. In fact,
   during my freshman year of college, I took a class that was introducing
   concepts I learned and experienced through PBHA when I was 14 years
   old. This place can easily put you ahead of the curve."

   A junior at [86]Boston University, Jorge Santana first learned of PBHA
   when he became a Mission Hill camper at age 13.

   Like Dubose, Santana worked as a junior counselor throughout high
   school before becoming a senior counselor. For the past two years, he
   has been directing the Mission Hill Summer Program, which serves the
   lower-income community there.

   In addition, as the organization's assessment and evaluation
   coordinator, Santana has the distinction of being the first person
   elected a member of PBHA's officer team who does not attend Harvard.
   The association's history at Harvard dates back to 1904.

   Before learning about PBHA's summer camps, "I would just stay home in
   the summer and watch TV," Santana said. "I didn't gain anything from
   that."

   That changed with camp. While fun is encouraged through afternoon field
   trips in and around Boston, mornings are dedicated to stimulating
   intellectual challenges and academic achievement.

   Each week, campers must complete two hours of math and two hours of
   literacy for their respective grade levels. Beyond that, junior
   counselors are encouraged to build curricula around the fields and
   subjects they are passionate about -- whether that's an introduction to
   the United Nations, music theory, or learning how to cook.

   "PBHA's Summer Urban Program creates opportunities for all those
   involved," said Maria Dominguez Gray, executive director of PBHA.
   "Campers and families benefit from enriching programming and a
   community deeply invested in children's academic and socio-emotional
   success. The teens are engaged in meaningful employment that offers
   needed job- and life-skills development and fosters the belief in self
   and one's future so critical to positive choices moving forward.

   "The college students who direct and teach in this program learn so
   much about themselves, about leadership, effective education, program
   development, and the challenges facing urban communities, learning that
   extends far beyond their classrooms."

   One of the successes of the program, Santana said, was its approach of
   viewing the city of Boston as a classroom without walls. By working
   closely with various organizations, exposing students to new
   neighborhoods and environments, the program could help to reduce
   tensions between neighborhoods, and the violence that can erupt as a
   result.

   "I grew up with that tension and understood what it meant," Santana
   said. "You weren't supposed to walk through certain neighborhoods, and
   people from other neighborhoods weren't supposed to walk through yours.
   But collaborating with various organizations throughout the city
   exposes kids to different areas and lowers that tension. Hopefully,
   that will help reduce that kind of violence as well."

   For Santana and Dubose, being involved in the summer program didn't
   just provide them with experience that will help them through college
   and what lies beyond. It also had a profound impact on their desire to
   give back to their communities.

   "When I run into girls whom I worked with several summers ago, they
   have all these memories about things I taught them," Dubose said. "I'll
   have forgotten, of course, but they remember. To know you've impacted
   the life of a young person in that way, and to see it again and again,
   year by year, is very powerful."
