On the scene at the Creative Arts Emmys: Sprinting to the stage and memorable
first wins

   TV fans are eagerly awaiting next weekend's Emmy Awards, but on Sunday
   evening, the celebration of the year's best television kicked off with
   the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. It's a ceremony that primarily
   honors behind-the-scenes work in TV but also packs in some categories
   like Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, which became the
   show's buzziest award when it went to comedy legend [43]Bob Newhart --
   his first Emmy win.

   nominations and the company's future

   The jokes coming from presenters at the Creative Arts Emmys mostly
   poked fun at the ceremony's long running time, nearly four hours of
   almost 90 awards (an edited-down telecast will air on FXX this
   Saturday), and the behind-the-scenes folks vs. stars dichotomy.
   "Tonight we honor all the people in television contractually forbidden
   to make eye-contact with me," first presenter Joel McHale joked.

   It's a night when the less magazine-covering, less spray-tan-prone of
   the TV world get to dress up and be recognized for their
   often-under-the-radar work.

   MythBusters co-host Kari Byron told EW before the show, held at Los
   Angeles' Nokia Theatre, "This is the one day a year that we take off
   the clothes that we worry about whether they're flammable or not and
   put on the fancy duds, walk the carpet and be part of this amazing
   celebration of the creative arts."

   But some were irked by the manner in which winners were honored at the
   event -- namely, the very limited time they each had to get to the
   stage and give their acceptance speech, while presenters like Gilbert
   Gottfried and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog rattled off wisecracks for
   five-plus minutes each.

   Producer of the show Spike Jones Jr. (not to be confused with Spike
   Jonze) stepped onstage before the event began and said, "You have 45
   seconds to get from your seat all the way down the aisle, up the steps,
   and do your acceptance speech. I'm not kidding. Forty-five seconds."

   So several of the winners -- including women in floor-length gowns and
   heels -- ran, even sprinted from their seats to the stage before
   breathlessly delivering a rushed acceptance speech.

   One multi-Emmy winner told [47]Deadline, "It's disrespectful, and it's
   offensive to the professionals in this room to treat them like cattleâ¦
   You can't find an extra minute for someone who wants to thank people
   after a huge moment? I believe they need to rethink the whole way this
   thing works. As it is, it's a little bit ridiculous."

   We'll see if the Creative Arts Emmys come to be known as the "sprint to
   the stage" show. Previously, it's been memorable for nominees as
   unbearably hot, as they've had to walk the carpet in triple-degree
   downtown L.A. weather. But this year there was a merciful breeze
   keeping attendees cool-ish. "This is a cake walk compared to last
   year," nominated composer Trevor Morris told EW on the carpet.

   Among the varied winners of the night were HBO's Liberace biopic Behind
   the Candelabra (which won eight awards), YouTube's The Lizzie Bennett
   Diaries, the picture editors of How I Met Your Mother, and the stunt
   coordinators of Revolution. Guest Actor awards went to Newhart for The
   Big Bang Theory, Melissa Leo for Louie, Dan Bucatinsky for Scandal, and
   The Good Wife`s Carrie Preston (her husband, Lost alum Michael Emerson,
   looked ready to celebrate that win as he entered Nokia Theatre with a
   flask in hand).

   Bucatinsky, who plays journalist and new dad James Novak on Scandal,
   looked particularly surprised and elated when his name was announced,
   leaping out of his seat and mouthing "oh my God." He won in a category
   that included Michael J. Fox and Harry Hamlin.

   The actor-writer-producer has a previous Emmy nomination for producing
   Web Therapy, but this year was the "first time I'm here as an actor.
   It's a huge honor," he told EW on the carpet. "I can't quite believe
   it. I keep pinching myself. So it's like a Cinderella moment for me."

   Check out the full list of winners [48]here. Read more about Newhart's
   win [49]here.

   The 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards will air on FXX this
   Saturday, Sept. 21, at 9 p.m. ET/PT. Emmys in 26 other categories will
   be presented at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards, which will air live on
   CBS Sunday, Sept. 22 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.
