Program prepares students for high-tech careers in packaging

   It's more than a question of "paper or plastic." Bagging, boxing, or
   wrapping products for transit as they speed from factory to consumers
   is the nation's third-largest industry.

   a shipping container's ability to survive being dropped multiple times
   during distribution. Jason Hoepker, at left, and Assistant Professor
   Laszlo Horvath evaluate a shipping container's ability to survive being
   dropped multiple times during distribution.

   The [83]College of Natural Resources and Environment is one of a
   handful of U.S. institutions preparing undergraduates for careers in
   packaging science. Classes are offered as a minor in the [84]Department
   of Sustainable Biomaterials, and plans are underway to offer a new
   bachelor's degree in packaging systems and design as early as the
   spring 2014 semester.

   "Virginia Tech's packaging program is crucially important because the
   growth of packaging companies depends upon a continuous supply of
   highly trained young professionals," said [85]Laszlo Horvath, assistant
   professor of practice.

   Packaging materials and new technologies inform customers and protect
   products from spoilage, damage, and tampering. Some "smart"
   technologies even interact with a product, signaling its freshness or
   integrity.

   The packaging industry needs graduates with expertise in package
   engineering, design, marketing, warehousing, and distribution, and an
   understanding of issues involved in the recycling and re-use of
   packaging materials, Horvath said. Packaging materials make up almost a
   third of municipal trash, so sustainability is a key factor in
   packaging design.

   Packaging professionals are in such demand that nearly every student
   graduating from Virginia Tech's program has found a job, and the
   typical salary of those positions is $50,000 to $60,000, Horvath said.
   "Industry representatives come to us looking for qualified students
   almost every month," he said.

   Students take courses ranging from computer-aided design to the science
   of wood-based composites. The program has focuses on hands-on
   experience with laboratory time incorporated into most courses.

   "Two things drew me into the packaging program," said junior Richard
   Good of Dinwiddie, Va., who is majoring in wood science and forest
   products. "I wanted to be part of a smaller program with lots of
   faculty interaction in this large university. The second reason is the
   industry. There are so many job prospects and opportunities for
   growth."

   Students in the program benefit from Virginia Tech's [86]Center for
   Packaging and Unit Load Design, an industry outreach center in the
   Brooks Forest Products Center.

   The center, which researches the design and performance of packaging
   systems, has meticulously standardized its testing process to a degree
   unmatched elsewhere, said Horvath, the center's director. Packaging
   products are crushed, torn, dropped, bent, and subjected to vibration,
   temperature changes, humidity, and other external forces to pinpoint
   any weaknesses. Each step of the testing process is recorded
   electronically, generating a database of images, graphs, and numeric
   results.

   "We take a lot of pictures of every tiny detail of the failure,"
   Horvath said. "Our results provide the information needed to redesign a
   better package."

   Good is one of five interns who spent summer 2013 performing packaging
   tests and other work at the center. The students are continuing
   specialized training and paid part-time work during the 2013-14
   academic year as part of the new Sustainable Packaging Designer Trainee
   program.

   Many students benefit from membership in the [87]student chapter of the
   Institute of Packaging Professionals, participating in design
   competitions and gaining professional exposure. Virginia Tech students
   tied for second place in a recent package design competition.

   "Participating in nationwide student packaging competitions, the
   students learn not only true collegiality through team work, but also
   some of the realities of creating workable solutions for industry,"
   said [88]Young Kim, assistant professor of practice and the student
   chapter's faculty advisor. "The experience dramatically helps students'
   career development and often results in unique job offers, even months
   before graduation."

   The rapidly expanding packaging program has benefited from generous
   corporate donations, including several pieces of large equipment and
   design software from Esko Graphics, a global supplier of integrated
   solutions for printing, finishing, and publishing.

   "Our relationship with industry is one of the strongest facets of the
   program," said [89]Robert Bush, professor of forest products marketing
   who teaches several packaging courses. "We are fortunate to have strong
   support from industry and trade associations in Virginia and
   nationwide. Donations of equipment and materials enable our students to
   work hands-on with the technologies prevalent in industry. Not only
   does this make their coursework more relevant, it makes them more
   appealing as potential employees."
