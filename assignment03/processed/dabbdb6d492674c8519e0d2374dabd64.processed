Aaron Alexis, 34, is dead gunman in Navy Yard shooting, authorities say

   [296][Shooting_Military_Building__-07cb2-kbFC--606x404@wp.com.jpg]

   [297]View Photo Gallery -- Aaron Alexis is identified as Navy Yard
   shooter: Authorities say the Navy veteran, who had been living in Fort
   Worth, was the dead gunman at the Washington Navy Yard.

By [298]Theresa Vargas, [299]Steve Hendrix and [300]Marc Fisher, E-mail the
writers

   Aaron Alexis lived for a time in a bungalow in the woods near a
   Buddhist temple in Fort Worth, where he occasionally joined Thai
   immigrants in meditation. Aaron Alexis died Monday in a gun battle with
   police at the Washington Navy Yard after he allegedly killed at least
   12 people.

   Along the way, the man named as the shooter in Monday's mass killing at
   Building 197 was discharged from the Navy Reserve, arrested after
   firing a bullet through his upstairs neighbor's floor and then asked to
   leave his Fort Worth apartment.

   [314]Mental illness among black men long misdiagnosed

   Courtland Milloy

   The consequences of mental illness among black men extends beyond the
   Navy Yard to daily gun violence.

   One Navy official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that
   Alexis was discharged in January 2011 for "a pattern of misconduct" and
   that the 2010 gun incident in Texas played a role in his departure.

   But Alexis, 34, had no trouble landing a civilian job. He moved from
   Fort Worth to Washington about a month ago, friends said, and was hired
   as an hourly tech employee for The Experts, a Hewlett-Packard
   subcontractor that is updating computer systems at Navy and Marine
   Corps installations worldwide. He was scheduled to begin work at the
   Washington Navy Yard this month.

   Those who knew Alexis in recent years describe him as a "sweet and
   intelligent guy" (a regular customer at the Thai restaurant where he
   had been a waiter) and "a good boy" (his landlord), but also as "very
   aggressive," someone who seemed as though he might one day kill himself
   (a lay worker at the Buddhist temple where Alexis worshiped).

   That angry streak flared often enough to create an arrest record in
   three states.

   In 2004, Alexis was arrested in Seattle after he fired three shots from
   a Glock pistol into the tires of a Honda Accord that two construction
   workers had parked in a driveway adjacent to Alexis's house. Alexis's
   father told detectives then that his son "had experienced anger
   management problems that the family believed was associated with PTSD,"
   or post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the police report. The
   father said Alexis had been "an active participant in rescue attempts
   of Sept. 11, 2001."

   Alexis's explanation for his behavior that day: The construction
   workers had "mocked" and "disrespected" him and then he had "a
   black-out fueled by anger."

   He was arrested but not charged, Seattle police said. The paperwork
   apparently was lost.

   "That report never got to the Seattle city attorney's office," said
   Kimberly Mills, a spokeswoman for the city attorney. "Consequently, we
   never filed charges."

   In 2008, Alexis was arrested on a disorderly conduct charge in DeKalb
   County, Ga. He spent two nights in jail, police said, but they had no
   other details.

   More recently, Alexis struck those who crossed his path as a man of
   sharp contrasts. He was learning the Thai language, visited Thailand
   for a month, was studying for an online degree in aeronautical
   engineering, and enjoyed conversing with diners, according to friends,
   customers and fellow worshipers. But some said he had an aggressive
   streak that made them keep their distance and avoid personal questions.

   "He's a 13-year-old stuck in a 34-year-old body," said Oui
   Suthamtewakul, owner of the Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White
   Settlement, Tex., and a friend who lived with Alexis for most of the
   past three years. "He needs attention."
