   Patent litigation used to be a form of legal redress. Today it is a
   business model.

   Any company that uses technology in its products or services today
   faces a steadily increasing threat of patent litigation. That threat is
   already costing operating companies approximately $11 billion per year
   in legal costs and lost productivity.

   RPX is changing this equation. Our market-based solution dramatically
   reduces patent-related costs for client companies by sharing risk
   across our network. We aggregate capital from annual subscription fees
   to acquire dangerous patents and patent rights, with each RPX client
   receiving a license to every asset we own. As the network continues to
   grow and our service offerings expand, we are removing progressively
   more high-threat patents - and more high-cost risk - from the operating
   ecosystem.

   The result: strong, broad-based defense against wasteful patent
   litigation and dramatically lower operating costs and financial risk
   for our clients.
