What Is And Is Not Monstrous

                                 [sam2.jpg]

   There are several interesting things about Obama advisor Samantha
   "Samwise" Power calling Hillary Clinton [13]a monster:

     "She is a monster, too - that is off the record - she is stooping to
     anything," Ms Power said, hastily trying to withdraw her remark.

     Ms Power said of the Clinton campaign: "Here, it looks like
     desperation. I hope it looks like desperation there, too.

     "You just look at her and think, 'Ergh'. But if you are poor and she
     is telling you some story about how Obama is going to take your job
     away, maybe it will be more effective. The amount of deceit she has
     put forward is really unattractive."

   #1
   Clinton, of course, is a monster. She's a monster for supporting the
   invasion of Iraq. She's a monster for being First Lady while we
   strangled Iraq during the nineties. She's a monster for being First
   Lady while we supported Turkey's massacres of Turkish Kurds. She's a
   monster for dozens of other reasons, all involving mass death.

   Yet these actions did not arouse such anger in Power. Why?

   #2
   What Power is furious about is Clinton competing with her. This is a
   very, very basic part of human nature. When people are competing with
   you, all of a sudden what previously appeared to you as minor faults
   become monstrous. If Power weren't part of the Obama campaign,
   Clinton's tactics would have barely registered with Power at all.

   Similarly, Power got extremely angry about the actions of Serbia's
   government during the Bosnian war in the mid-nineties. Meanwhile, as
   far as I know, she's never said a single word about a similar situation
   during the same period: the Turkish government killing tens of
   thousands of Turkish Kurds (and Iraqi Kurds) to suppress a separatist
   movement.

   Why did Power get angry about one and not the other? Because the
   Serbian government was acting against the wishes of the US government,
   and thus (to Power) competing with her. And because the Turkish
   government was licking the boots of the US, and thus (to Power) not
   competing with her.

   Amusingly, Power's counterparts on the Clinton campaign are exactly the
   same. They're furious at Obama because he's competing with them, not
   because of their stated reasons (he's "presumptuous"). And Clintonites
   got angry at Saddam Hussein because he presented competition, not for
   the reasons they claimed (he's a horrible dictator, etc.). (Background
   [14]here.)

   #3
   No one with Samantha Power's lack of self-knowledge should be allowed
   within a million miles of power. However, "should" and "is" are
   different things.

   #4

     Already the Ring tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason. Wild
     fantasies arouse in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, Hero of
     the Age, striding with a flaming sword across the darkened land, and
     armies flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of
     Barad-dûr. And then all the clouds rolled away, and the white sun
     shone, and at his command the vale of Gorgoroth became a garden of
     flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He had only to put on the
     Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be.

   Imagine if Frodo had attempted to snatch back the ring from Samwise at
   this point. He would have been a MONSTER!!!

   #5
   The ring must be destroyed.

   She has quit her job with Obama.

   The good question you ask is who should be permitted "within a million
   miles of power."

   Who decides? Those already with power. Who, of course, themselves
   shouldn't be "within a million miles of power."

   Kafkaesque? You betcha. Now you know why Kafka and his friends roared
   with laughter when he read his stories to them.

   If it's true that Hillary was a monster during the 1990s for being
   married to the man who sent missiles into Sudan and Afghanistan,
   screwed the Kurds, and strangled the Iraqis with sanctions, then it's
   also true that I was a monster during that time for enjoying a
   well-paying job at a biotech firm, and you were a monster for doing
   whatever you were doing. We are all part of the same corrupt system,
   and are all equally responsible.

   Of course, Hillary could have divorced Bill and made a public statement
   against "wag the dog" politics. I could have quit my job and gone to
   India to help Mother Theresa, but I didn't. Most of us content
   ourselves with doing what we can in our daily lives, such as smiling at
   people, or taking "paper or plastic?" seriously. You know, random acts
   of kindness.

   Bill's own decisions during those years, or Hillary's vote to enable
   the war in Iraq, are a different matter. Those are situations of direct
   responsbility. But I don't think Hillary should be blamed more than you
   or I for the acts of her husband's administration. (Nor should she get
   any particular credit.)

   That said, I'm on board with your larger point about Samantha Power's
   selective indignation, the temptations of power and all that. Have you
   figured out how to destroy the Ring? Do we even know who is holding it?
   If it is in us all, virally, it may prove difficult to eradicate.
   Posted by: [15]eatbees at March 7, 2008 02:17 PM

   The Ring can't be destroyed by any means we possess, because it is the
   embodiment of power. Someone is going to wield it.

   The question is who we *want* to wield it. Do we want someone who
   utters flowery proclamations of hope, or someone who spits daily curses
   at friends and foes alike? Ultimately it doesn't matter -- we want the
   person who will *create* a hopeful world, regardless of what they say
   or how they might act. But right now, we only have their words to go
   on.

   Ms. Powers needed to resign simply because a staffer should never, ever
   be the story in a campaign. She was a naivete who did something stupid
   with the best intentions. Her resignation distanced her words from
   Obama, which was necessary and right.

   Hillary, on the other hand, is the one who is acting in bad faith,
   doing all that she can to destroy someone who should be an ally and
   potentially throwing the Ring of power into the hands of evil men. I'm
   sure she has the best intentions also...but she's putting herself in a
   very bad light.

   In the final analysis I don't think this is going to do much for either
   campaign. Hillary gets a news cycle; Obama retains the moral high
   ground. The quest will go on from here.

   Judging from her Democracy Now interview a week or two ago, she
   actually knows better than she usually lets on--Amy Goodman pressed her
   on East Timor, pointing out that it was more than just the US looking
   away from genocide, but actively assisting in it and Power agreed that
   it was a sin of commission, not of omission.

   Which means she probably consciously suppressed that in her book. She
   could have had an entire chapter on East Timor, but then she would be
   accusing five Presidents not simply of looking away from genocide, but
   actively assisting in it. I suppose you have to make a choice--suppress
   part of the truth and you can be lionized by the MSM and join a
   Presidential campaign that has a chance of winning. Or tell the full
   ugly truth and you get to be the informal advisor to Dennis Kucinich.

   "The Ring can't be destroyed by any means we possess, because it is the

   we *want* to wield it."

   Dude, you never actually read The Lord of the Rings, have you? They had
   whole chapters discussing why this is bullshit.

   Now, maybe that makes this whole thing a false analogy. But you might
   as well say, "I'm Boromir, give *me* the ring!"
   Posted by: [17]David Grenier at March 7, 2008 03:55 PM

   Here's the transcript of the Democracy Now interview I mentioned.

   Power isn't quite as forthright as I remembered. It sounded better on
   the radio than it reads. When Amy Goodman says (scroll down a bit) that
   in East Timor it wasn't just an issue of us looking away, Power hastily
   agrees, and quickly changes the subject back to 1999, when the US
   became one of the good guys.

   I just looked at a couple of mainstream liberal blogs--as one could
   have predicted, they all look at it strictly from the campaign
   viewpoint and either say Power has to go, or else point out that she's
   under a lot of stress and says things she doesn't mean. I agree--when
   she says Clinton is not a monster she doesn't mean it. If she knows
   anything about East Timor (and she does), she knows that Clinton's
   likely choice for Secretary of State is Richard Holbrooke and Holbrooke
   was responsible for Carter's policy in East Timor.

   I do think Power is less of a monster than Clinton. Sticking to the
   LOTR analogy, Power is Boromir--a well-intentioned person who thinks he
   could handle the ring and do good, and incidentally win a lot of glory
   in the process. HRC is more of a Saruman figure--any good intentions
   she may have had once have long since corroded away.
   Posted by: Donald Johnson at March 7, 2008 04:30 PM

   If power is such that even proximity to it corrodes formerly good
   people to such an extent that they can no longer even recognize their
   former good intentions, then we are screwed, aren't we?

   As Remus Shepherd says above, someone is going to wield it.

   Would it be possible to do away with even the concept of power? Power
   for good or power for evil? Please tell me how.
   Posted by: [18]eatbees at March 7, 2008 04:57 PM

   I don't think we need to get too abstract here. One can refrain from
   committing war crimes by cutting down on the number of wars one chooses
   to fight.

   At another blog I just saw this priceless statement in the comment
   section. I'll paraphrase--

   "The fact that a scholar of genocide is comparing Hillary Clinton to
   murderous tyrants just shows that the people in the two campaigns have
   lost perspective."

   Not an exact quote, but close enough. And of course that must be it. No
   one in his or her right mind could possibly think a powerful American
   politician has blood on his or her hands.
   Posted by: Donald Johnson at March 7, 2008 05:06 PM

     Would it be possible to do away with even the concept of power?
     Power for good or power for evil? Please tell me how.

   The whole history of human experimentation in government is the story
   of our trying to figure this out. I'd say the most important lesson of
   human history is that while you can't and wouldn't want to do away with
   power, it must be as temporary and diffuse as possible.

   So we invented elections. The Romans limited the office of dictator to
   six months. The constitution was written to give the power to declare
   war to Congress, not the president. The founding fathers were against
   standing armies. We created term limits for presidents. Etc.

   All this is good. But we have a long way to go, and in fact (here in
   the U.S., at least) are backsliding. Let's concentrate on getting back
   what we've lost, and then figure out how to move forward.

   One of the most obvious things we have to do is cut the
   military-industrial complex way back, or the temptation to use it will
   always be too strong to resist.

   If Hillary is a monster (and I'm not a Hillary fan, will not vote for
   her or for him), then what names do we reserve for the administrations
   who have savaged Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and all the
   other people who are not "we"?

   "The ring is mine," said Frodo. "I do not choose to [throw it into
   Mount Doom]."

   And of course there is a way to defeat its power. Read the books and
   look for the bits about a big, like, pit.

   Her husband savaged Iraq with sanctions, and as Jonathan writes, gave
   Turkey weapons that were useful in slaughtering Kurds. I think the
   Clintons are pretty close in their policy views.

   Returning OT, if you want a clean copy of the Karon piece, how about
   here for example?

   http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article17726.htm

   In fact there are copies all over the web, just use google.

   It's true that weeks before Hamas actually kicked out Dahlan's thugs,
   people were making the same sorts of allegations we can read in the
   Vanity Fair article today. What the Vanity Fair article brings us is
   deeper background, documentary proof, and interviews on the record with
   people who were there.

   But check this out, from the blog Palestinian Pundit. I was looking for
   an article that he quoted before the Karon piece even came out, written
   by a local academic and outlining the same sort of theory of a coup in
   the making. I couldn't find it, but I did find this from May 3, 2007
   commenting on the General Dayton security plan, two weeks before
   Karon's article and six weeks before the Hamas takeover.

   In effect this will put Palestinian puppet forces under direct Usraeli
   control and Usrael will use them to crush the Palestinian resistance.
   The puppet Abbas is already on board with the CIA asset Dahlan. This is
   the Palestinian version of the Maliki puppet government complete with
   death squads and the Salvador option in Palestine. Are you paying
   attention Hamas? Or are you still being fooled by "national unity?"

   http://palestinianpundit.blogspot.com/2007/05/complete-us-control-of-pa
   lestinian.html

   All the elements of the Vanity Fair article are there, aren't they? I
   thought it was ranting at the time (because it sounds like ranting) but
   at least I wasn't surprised or confused when Hamas made its move.

   By the way, what about the blindness of expert analysts? Why are they
   the only ones caught by surprise by events? Is it the power of the
   Ring?
   Posted by: [21]eatbees at March 7, 2008 07:07 PM

   There is but one question here with your conjecture: what is the Ring?
   Is it the office of the President of the United States? The political
   process of the United States? The superpower status of the United
   States? The worst in human nature brought out by having to fight tooth
   and nail for something? The United States itself? The capitalist system
   itself? What is the Ring? If we know what we have to destroy, then we
   can destroy it.

   Take a look at the video of Prof. Power's apology on Huffington.
   She can't believe the "monster" crack came out of her mouth. She's
   always said good things about Hillary's leadership. She's spent time
   with Hillary and Hillary is a "warm" and "funny" person.
   So now we have a new concept: The Hillarity of Evil.
   But in all seriosity, if you were a student in her course, would you
   believe what came out of her mouth?

   Posted by: donescobar at March 7, 2008 10:49 PM

   This is a very, very basic part of human nature. When people are
   competing with you, all of a sudden what previously appeared to you as
   minor faults become monstrous.

   I'm not sure you should use people like Samantha Power as the basis for
   speculation about "human nature." I say that because Power isn't
   representative of the species, because she belongs to a special subset
   of humans who get paid for their political opinions.

   Most of us don't. My belief that Hitler was a monster hasn't brought me
   any reward, not like the rewards that came to the neocons when they
   suddenly "discovered" Saddam Hussein's monstrosity."

   The vast majority of humans, presented with the facts about Turkey's
   treatment of the Kurdish people, would agree that these actions are
   monstrous. Only a tiny subset of humans would think otherwise, because
   they either work for the Turkish or US governments or hope to do so
   some day.

   The problem isn't human nature, it's a system that rewards people for
   having the "right" opinions and punishes people for having the "wrong"
   opinions.

   Donald Johnson had it right:
   I suppose you have to make a choice--suppress part of the truth and you
   can be lionized by the MSM and join a Presidential campaign that has a
   chance of winning. Or tell the full ugly truth and you get to be the
   informal advisor to Dennis Kucinich.

   The only correction I would make is to replace "you" with "the 0.001%
   of the population that has a shot at becoming an adviser to a
   presidential campaign."
   Posted by: SteveB at March 8, 2008 08:18 AM

   I just woke up to the BBC overnight and listened to the last fifteen,
   twenty minutes of Samantha Power's interview. I was struck with how
   genuine she was. I don't think that sleep had dulled my bullshit
   detector.

   In Jon's piece there was a comment about her seeing Bosnia as genocide
   and Turkey's war against the Kurds not being genocide. I wouldn't
   presume her position without reading or hearing her speak about it.
   After all, I don't think any of us have stood in front of tanks or
   denounced this or that evil dictator in his or her own turf. Give me
   enough time and energy and I can probably find a holocaust somewhere at
   sometime that you haven't fully condemned to my satisfaction.

   What I would say about Power is that judging from what I heard on that
   interview if she said, off the record, that Hillary Clinton is a
   "monster," and this would be regarding her character and her
   psychological constellation (which I think is what she meant), I would
   want to hear more about her basis for making that judgement.
   Posted by: [22]Bob In Pacifica at March 8, 2008 09:22 AM

   It seems to me, now that Hitler the "monster" has made it into the
   post, we might want to put her "monster" remark into a context several
   notches below. I suspect she used the word the way parents at a classy
   day school might describe the bad behavior of one of the kids at
   recess. That Roger is a regular "monster," they might say of the bully
   in the sandbox or at the arts and crafts exhibit.
   Now, coming from the author of a book about genocide, her use turned
   the interpretation way, way up. That she didn't sense this could be due
   to her involvement in the heat of the campaign.
   But the worst of it, it obscures the real monstrosity of people in
   power, from leaders in government to heads of corporations. Monstrosity
   has thus been reduced to bad form. And that's just the way the MSM,
   both parties, their financial backers and --sad to say--most "ordinary
   Americans"--prefer to have it. The Style Section is our moral guide
   now.

   Bob:

   or that evil dictator in his or her own turf.

   That's exactly the right comparison, except Power isn't facing tanks or
   dictators. She'd just be facing not winning a Pulitzer, not teaching at
   Harvard, and not advising serious presidential candidates. So she has
   much less excuse.

   I would want to hear more about her basis for making that judgement.

   The article has a fair amount about why she said that, including what I
   quoted: "You just look at her and think, 'Ergh'. But if you are poor
   and she is telling you some story about how Obama is going to take your
   job away, maybe it will be more effective. The amount of deceit she has
   put forward is really unattractive."

   That's pretty gross in its own right.
   Posted by: [23]Jonathan Schwarz at March 8, 2008 10:40 AM

   Also, I should say I don't think she's the worst person who ever lived,
   or anything close to that. It's just that weeping and moaning over the
   actions of official enemies or official non-entities is not that
   impressive. The Soviet Union had all kinds of people who made a good
   living being horrified by the actions of the US, South Africa, etc.,
   but we don't look at them as especially splendid examples of morality.

   Maybe our many-times great-grandchildren will destroy it by becoming
   something that is not-us. In the meantime the best we can do, and the
   best our children can do, is to ride the pendulum, back and forth and
   learn a little more from each swing. Forge The Ring in order to make
   the world a "better" place, wield it until the improvements we've made
   can no longer be tolerated, steal The Ring from ourselves and destroy
   it in the fire of revolution, sing heroic songs about its destruction,
   and forge a new Ring with which to make a new and better world.

   I had this theory that maybe Power had dissed Clinton on human rights
   grounds, but Dennis Perrin's latest post mentions a fact (quickly
   confirmed with some googling) that Power is friends with Richard
   Holbrooke--the guy in charge of Carter's policy in East Timor. Which
   probably helps explain why Power has said so little about East Timor
   pre-1999. East Timor is the elephant in the room when it comes to US
   support for genocide, and it was bipartisan support from five
   successive presidents. Nobody who wants to advocate for human rights
   and yet still hobnob with the powerful can afford the luxury of
   excessive honesty, I suppose.

   In general most American politicians are willing to support murderous
   policies if that's the politically smart thing to do. Clinton (and
   Obama and virtually all other American politicians) gave a green light
   to Israel to indiscriminately bomb Lebanese civilians in 2006 and
   pretended that the civilian deaths were all the fault of Hezbollah
   (Human Rights Watch investigated and found otherwise.)

   I'll support the lesser of two evils when I have to--I did in 2004 and
   may do so again in 2008 (though in my state it's not necessary--Clinton
   or Obama will win no matter what). But I don't think any good is done
   by pretending Bush is some extreme outlier, or by pretending that there
   is some magic moral principle that allows American presidents to
   support murderous policies without it tainting them in some way.

   The fact is Bush was going to attack Iraq with or without the passage
   of the Resolution. The Senate managed to extract a promise in exchange
   for signing on, i.e. Bush would exhaust peaceful means at the UN and
   come back to Congress. Should they have known Bush could not be
   trusted? Sure - I'm a dumb housewife and I knew what was up. Still,
   it's not "monsterous" to have a different conclusion from the same set
   of facts.

   Clinton and many of the other Democrats took the position they took in
   part out of political cowardice. Bush was the great war god of American
   politics in 2002, or the Winston Churchill of our time (which comes to
   the same thing) and anyone who opposed him was an appeaser.

   Whether one calls that monstrous or not is a matter of opinion. It's
   hard for me to empathize with politicians because they all seem to have
   desires that are alien to normal people, but if my job were at stake,
   maybe I'd be like them.

   Anyway, the Iraq authorization to use force vote is hardly the only
   time Clinton lied about matters of life and death. She and St. Obama
   both endorsed Israel's indiscriminate bombing of Lebanon, as I
   mentioned above. Hamas leaders just praised the murder of those
   seminary students--I don't see that this is better or worse than
   Clinton/Obama praising Israel's Lebanon actions.

   I don't understand how politicians possess "desires that are alien to
   normal people."
   If, say, Hillary had just practiced law and not become a politician,
   would those "desires" still be evident in her work or life, or just
   dormant? Are they present in some people (and not others) and political
   life simply propels them to emerge?
   Who else possesses these "desires?" A mafia gang boss in NJ? A cop in
   Chicago? A dentist in Pittsburgh? How can you tell? Do they drive
   people into politics, or does politics bring them out?
   I suspect "normal people" harbor these "desires" (the will to power
   being one?) also, but suppress them: out of cowardice, fear, or
   conscience.
   Could you elaborate?
   And, don't "normal people" behave quite similarly as politicians do,
   except on a smaller and rarely scrutinized scale? (Office politics?)
