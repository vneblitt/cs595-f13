College of Agriculture and Life Sciences undergraduate translates wasted food
into dollar amount

   BLACKSBURG, Va., July 22, 2013 - It's lunchtime at a local elementary
   school.

   Kids snake through the line as they do every school day, grab an
   entrée, a piece of fruit, a side item, and a beverage, then pay for
   their meal and take their places at a lunch table. Nothing out of the
   ordinary here.

   But then those kids, on average, throw half of their food away,
   sometimes as much as 70 percent of it, according to an analysis of food
   waste research being done by Lindsey Kummer of Frederick, Md., a rising
   junior majoring in [160]human nutrition, foods and exercise in the
   Virginia Tech [161]College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. She is one
   of a handful of students participating in the Human Nutrition, Foods
   and Exercise Summer Undergraduate Research Scholars Program, which is
   sponsored by the department and the [162]Fralin Life Science Institute.

   Kummer's research aims to figure out why one pre-K and four
   kindergarten classes threw away uneaten food and, most importantly,
   gives a dollar figure to the students' food waste.

   Kummer, a former competitive figure skater who grew up with healthy
   eating habits reinforced at home, always thought choosing nutritional
   foods would help her perform her best as an athlete.

   Studying food waste examines the resources, time, and energy it takes
   to get food to the consumer -- only for it to end up rotting in a
   landfill or dumpster.

   "Food waste is not only about the nutritional aspects of poor diets
   -- it's also about economics," said Kummer. "Money is allocated at the
   federal level to support school lunch programs and that money is being
   wasted."

   "Lindsey's research is focusing on quantifying the direct cost of food
   waste. We think a dollar amount may be more compelling to kids,
   parents, teachers, and administrators to take action and be mindful
   about food," said Elena Serrano, associate professor of human
   nutrition, foods and exercise, and Kummer's mentor in the department's
   summer scholar program.

   Kummer's analysis found that the total cost of waste for the 304
   lunches observed during the week the research team was at the
   elementary school was $219.99, or 72 cents per child. A whopping 70
   percent of the vegetables in the lunch were wasted.

   The total cost doesn't seem like much overall, but consider the figures
   represent only one-fifth of the entire school in one week.  If you were
   to measure an entire school's annual food waste, it would quickly get
   into the hundreds of thousand of dollars. Once you expand that cost to
   schools across the nation, the amount wasted is astronomical.

   A few decades ago, the topic of food waste may have only drawn the ire
   of frantic parents who lamented leftover dinner being tossed in the
   family garbage can. But as the world population approaches 9 billion,
   food waste is not just about children who clean their plate. Food waste
   is a defining socio-economic concern of the 21st century in both the
   developed and developing world. Waste is entangled in every aspect of
   food production and consumption, from the farmer to the cook to the
   consumer, and has proven to be a major contributor to not only food
   insecurity, but global warming and obesity worldwide.

   Globally, addressing food waste is taking center stage as one of the
   drivers in achieving food security. The Food and Agriculture
   Organization estimates that the amount of food the developing world
   throws away -- 222 million tons -- is almost as much as the entire food
   production of sub-Saharan Africa. Worldwide, fruits, vegetables, and
   roots and tuber crops such as potatoes, have the highest waste rates of
   any food -- another finding that was mirrored by the Virginia Tech
   analysis.

   Kummer's preliminary data supports the idea that food waste is an
   epidemic, even on the microscale of one elementary school grade level
   in Southwestern Virginia.

   "A tremendous amount of resources goes into serving these prepared
   foods -- from growing and harvesting them to transporting and preparing
   them," said Serrano. "So many resources are literally being thrown
   away."

   "What this research says is that while the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture has ensured that school lunches meet robust standards,
   including colorful fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean
   proteins, we have a long way to go to get kids to eat the foods. We
   also have to address a culture that is OK with wasting food," said
   Serrano.

   During the summer of 2013, almost 100 students are taking part in paid
   undergraduate research experiences through the Fralin Life Science
   Institute Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship; the Scieneering
   program; Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise Summer Undergraduate
   Research Scholars Program; the Summer Engineering Education
   Collaboratory program; and Research Experiences for Undergraduates in
   Tire and Automotive Engineering. The [163]Office of Undergraduate
   Research is coordinating workshops and activities for the programs'
   participants through the summer. Students will present their work at
   the Virginia Tech Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium on Wednesday,
   July 31.

   Nationally ranked among the top research institutions of its kind,
   Virginia Tech's [164]College of Agriculture and Life Sciences focuses
   on the science and business of living systems through learning,
   discovery, and engagement. The college's comprehensive curriculum gives
   more than 3,100 students in a dozen academic departments a balanced
   education that ranges from food and fiber production to economics to
   human health. Students learn from the world's leading agricultural
   scientists, who bring the latest science and technology into the
   classroom.
