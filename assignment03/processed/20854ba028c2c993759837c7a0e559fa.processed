A (Married) Life at the Opera

   August 15, 2013 by [14]Jennifer Gavin

   It‚s a fair thing to say that classical music, and more specifically
   opera, is what brought me and my husband together.¬  We met while
   working at The Denver Post, but our first date ‚ seeing Verdi‚s ‚Un
   Ballo in Maschera‚ at Opera
   [15]A very early text of "Don Giovanni"

   An early "Don Giovanni," dubbed "a playful drama in two acts"

   Colorado ‚ may have been a sort of test. He didn‚t want to marry anyone
   who wasn‚t into opera, and I wanted someone who wouldn‚t squirm at the
   sound of ‚squeaky [16]violins and tinkly [17]pianos,‚ as one of my
   ex-boyfriends once described classical.

   We‚ve seen symphonies, chamber-music concerts and yes, operas in our
   quarter-century together.¬  Mostly operas.¬  Shortly after we moved to
   the Washington, D.C. area I got him season tickets for opera as a
   birthday present. We just kept going.¬  It‚s been wonderful!

   We‚ve seen -- no pun intended -- scores of operas, including multiple
   bites at my two favorites, Mozart‚s ‚The Marriage of Figaro‚ and
   Richard Strauss‚ ‚Der Rosenkavalier.‚¬  And the exhibition ‚A Night at
   the Opera‚ that the Library of Congress is opening today will probably
   get visited, repeatedly, by my spouse because it‚s heavy on items by
   his two favorite opera composers: Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner,
   both of whom are observing 200^th-birthday celebrations this year.

   If opera gets inside your head ‚ even at the Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd
   level ‚ you‚ll really enjoy this exhibition.¬  It displays several
   manuscripts in the composers‚ own hand ‚ one from Verdi‚s opera
   ‚Attila‚ and another from Wagner‚s ‚Walk√ºren‚ (The Valkyrie); a third
   from Alban Berg‚s ‚Wozzeck‚ and letters -- from Berg to fellow composer
   Schoenberg and from Puccini to Alfredo Vandini.¬  It can inspire awe to
   be¬  a few inches away from something these greats actually touched.

   And the exhibition¬  features programs and the stage manager‚s original
   score from George and Ira Gershwin‚s ‚Porgy and Bess,‚ from the
   Library‚s unparalleled [18]Gershwin collection.

   There are also many beautiful visuals: first editions of opera scores
   (including a 1787 piano-vocal score from Mozart‚s ‚Don Giovanni‚ and
   the full score from Wagner‚s ‚Lohengrin‚) and photos of some of opera‚s
   greatest stars through history, from Enrico Caruso (as Radam√©s in
   ‚Aida‚) to Lauritz Melchior (as Lohengrin) to Marian Anderson as Ulrica
   in ‚Ballo‚) to Lily Pons as Lakm√© and Alexander Kipnis as the title
   character in ‚Boris Godunov.‚

   Speaking of Boris, there is a wonderful wall-size rendition of the
   coronation scene from ‚Boris‚¬  and there are gorgeous set designs, in
   watercolor, by Oliver Smith for his 1960s productions of ‚Carmen‚ and
   ‚Don Giovanni.‚¬  The exhibit also features the original Galileo Chini
   set design for Puccini‚s ‚Turandot‚ from 1926.

   The Library of Congress has superb music collections, and this
   exhibition brings forward the cream of its huge opera holdings.¬  Don‚t
   miss it!
