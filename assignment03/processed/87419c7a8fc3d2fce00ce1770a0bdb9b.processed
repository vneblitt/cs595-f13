Longevity of Human Civilization Symposium at Kluge Center Sept 12

   Will the longevity of human civilization on Earth be imperiled, or
   enhanced, by our world-changing technologies? Scientists, humanists,
   journalists and science-fiction authors will convene to answer this
   question in a daylong symposium at the Library of Congress John W.
   Kluge Center on Sept. 12.

   David H. Grinspoon, the first Baruch S. Blumberg NASA/Library of
   Congress Chair in Astrobiology at the Kluge Center, will lead the
   discussions.

   The symposium, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 12, is
   free and open to the public. The events will take place in room 119 of
   the Libraryâs Thomas Jefferson Building, 10 First St. S.E., Washington,
   D.C.

   There will be four panels devoted to the theme of longevity. One panel
   will focus on nature: What of nature is left to be saved and how will
   humans choose to save it? A second will address human imaginings of the
   future and will feature science fiction writers in conversations with
   scientists. A third panel will specifically address world-altering
   technologies, including those that may affect climate or biological
   evolution, as well as those that may prevent future disasters. The
   final panel will be a group discussion summarizing the entirety of the
   day.

   "Weâve reached the stage in Earthâs evolution where humans are now a
   major agent of planetary change," says Grinspoon. "Will these abilities
   threaten our survival as a species, or even threaten the Earth as a
   whole, or will we come to live comfortably with these new powers and
   use them to avoid, rather than hasten, disaster? This event is meant to
   explore these questions from a wide range of perspectives."

   A well-known researcher in planetary science, Grinspoon has been a
   scholar-in-residence at the Kluge Center since November 2012, studying
   the "Anthropocene Era," the proposed phase of Earth history defined by
   human influence, from the perspective of astrobiology, the scientific
   study of life in the universe. This work grew out of his book "Lonely
   Planets: The Natural Philosophy of Alien Life," recipient of the 2004
   PEN Center USA Literary Award for Research Nonfiction.

   The astrobiology chair is a distinguished senior research position
   housed within the John W. Kluge Center. Using the collections and
   services at the Library, the chair holder conducts research at the
   intersection between the science of astrobiology and its humanistic
   aspects, particularly its societal implications. The chair honors the
   late Baruch Blumberg, a Nobel Prize winner in medicine, former member
   of the Libraryâs Scholars Council and the founding director of NASAâs
   Astrobiology Institute, who actively promoted research and development
   across disciplines. For more information visit
   [19]www.loc.gov/today/pr/2011/11-202.html.

   Through a generous endowment from John W. Kluge, the Library of
   Congress established the Kluge Center in 2000 to bring together the
   worldâs best thinkers to stimulate and energize one another, to distill
   wisdom from the Libraryâs rich resources and to interact with
   policymakers in Washington. For further information on the Kluge
   Center, visit [20]www.loc.gov/kluge/.

   The NASA Astrobiology Program supports research into the origins,
   evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. The NASA
   Astrobiology Institute (NAI), an element of that program, is a
   partnership among NASA, 14 U.S. teams, and 10 international consortia.
   NAIâs goals are to promote, conduct, and lead interdisciplinary
   astrobiology research, train a new generation of astrobiology
   researchers, and share the excitement of astrobiology with learners of
   all ages.
