Post Op-Ed Writer Says Her Message on Student-Teacher Relationships Was
Distorted

   Posted by [86]Perry Stein on Sep. 4, 2013 at 12:54 pm

   karasik

   A Dupont-area artist and former lawyer wrote an [87]op-ed in the
   Washington Post over the weekend that called for the decriminalization
   of student-teacher relationships in most circumstances. Betsy Karasik's
   piece was pegged to the high-profile case in Montana, in which a
   teenage girl had a sexual relationship with her teacher and later
   committed suicide. The teacher was sentenced to 30 days in jail last
   week. Unsurprisingly, Karasik's op-ed was immediately slammed as
   incendiary--a baseless argument grounded in anecdotal evidence that
   condones statutory rape.  It immediately spurred responses from places
   like [88]Slate, [89]Jezebel, and [90]ThinkProgress.

   Fred Hiatt, editor of the Post's editorial page, defended the decision
   to publish the editorial, saying "it raised a legitimate question,
   namely, is a criminal trial always the most beneficial route for
   victims of sexual abuse?"

   "The purpose of an op-ed page is to offer a forum for debate, including
   for perspectives that may run against the grain of majority opinion,"
   Hiatt writes in an email.

   Hiatt writes that the original online headline of the piece was "Sex
   between students and teachers should not be a crime." Although he felt
   that was true to Karasik's argument, it was later changed to "The
   unintended consequences of laws addressing sex between teachers and
   students" because "I felt [the original] might convey to readers that
   the author was condoning sex between students and teachers, which the
   piece clearly does not do."

   I reached out to Karasik to find out why she wrote the op-ed, if she
   thinks the public understood her intended message, and, given the
   backlash, if she has any regrets.

   Below is our unedited Q&A, which was conducted via email.

   Have you been an advocate for rethinking the way we criminalize
   teacher-student relationships in the past?

   Betsy Karasik: This is not a topic I have ever written about or
   advocated about publically in the past, but over the years I have
   discussed it with many people including parents, victims of abuse,
   academics, and mental health professionals. What usually triggers me to
   write columns is that some particular incident incites a strong
   emotional reaction. In this case, I heard an NPR piece about the
   Rambold case in Montana, which motivated me to try to articulate some
   of the ideas I have been mulling for a long time. Having worked as a
   litigator, I know how stressful the legal process was for my clients,
   even with civil trials. So although I have no way to corroborate this,
   I strongly suspected that the pressure of the criminal proceedings may
   have had a harmful impact on Ms. Morales' state of mind and helped push
   her to commit suicide.

   Have you submitted other op-eds to the Washington Post before? If so,
   on what topics?

   Yes, I've written perhaps a dozen op-eds and pieces for the Close to
   Home section over the past 10 years. Two were about President Obama, a
   number have been about nature and the environment, and some have been
   more personal. For instance, after a heroic dog named Target a soldier
   brought back with him from Afghanistan was accidentally euthanized in
   an Arizona animal shelter, I wrote a piece urging people to adopt
   animals from shelters rather than buying pets from breeders.

   What was the editing process like with the Post for this submission?

   I sent a short version to the editors and they asked me to expand
   certain sections. Then there was a lot of back and forth about smaller
   changes. Toward the end we were under deadline, and unfortunately a
   couple areas of the piece ended up a bit unfocused and ambiguous. But I
   take responsibility for signing off on the final draft. One thing I had
   asked for, but the Post refused, was to refer to the victim as "Ms.
   Morales" instead of just "Morales" but that is apparently standard
   style for the Post. Also, as is probably obvious, there are severe
   space limitations with an op-ed piece, so one cannot devote a lot of
   space to qualifying and elaborating on statements.

   You mentioned to me that the media and public have distorted your piece
   to further their agendas. In what ways has your message been misread?

   My intent was to explore whether society can do a better job in the way
   it responds to sex between students and teachers. I think a fair
   reading makes it clear my goal is to protect victims of abuse from
   unnecessary trauma and, when sex is consensual, remove the teacher from
   the school without further traumatizing the student with criminal
   proceedings. But the vast majority of commentators fixated on my
   suggestion about decriminalizing consensual sex, claiming that I
   condone or even advocate sex between students and teachers. That is
   just totally false; I clearly state all teachers who have sexual
   relations with students should be fired and prohibited from teaching
   unless the law deems them rehabilitated. There is a big difference
   which seems to have been lost on people.

   Another group of critics interpreted my piece as a defense of the judge
   and the verdict in the Montana case, even though I specifically stated
   I found his comments indefensible and noted that it was appropriate he
   apologized. Part of the confusion may have been that I included a
   sentence that states "...tarring and feathering him ... will not
   advance this much-needed dialogue [about sex in schools]." Some took
   that to mean I was expressing sympathy for the judge and blaming the
   victim, which I was not.My point was that when people see the
   incendiary reaction to his remarks, they will hesitate to make any
   statements about this topic that are even mildly controversial, and it
   may be a long time before any judge feels free to express any type of
   nuanced opinion about this kind of case.

   Going back to the space limitation issues, it never occurred to me that
   I would need to specifically spell out that I was against rape, abuse
   and exploitation. I assumed that would be a given. But a surprising
   number of readers took that omission as license to claim that I am a
   sociopathic pedophile rape-apologist. With social media these days,
   there is little room for polite engagement; once you have been targeted
   for criticism you are immediately Satan.

   Think Progress posted a sharp attack based on several short excerpts
   from my piece without quoting or providing a link to the entire piece;
   I pointed out to them that they were ensuring most readers would be
   judging it without the benefit of any context, but they never
   responded. Media Matters [91]posted a piece with the headline: "Wash.
   Post Publishes Pro-Statutory Rape Op-Ed." The [92]Slate tag line on me
   comes up in Google as "Washington Post Argues That Rape is No Biggie."

   The more outrageously I am portrayed by these entities, the greater the
   traffic to their websites and support for their platforms. I think it's
   pretty cynical of them to be attacking me for being irresponsible when
   they are representing my ideas irresponsibly to fire up their readers.
   This state of the media really saddens me.

   Have you received any feedback from people that agree with your
   argument in the piece?

   I have received a lot of feedback from people who agree with my
   arguments, or at least see a kernel of truth there and are very
   grateful that I have sparked an open debate. Many acknowledge that it
   is political and professional suicide to associate oneself with these
   ideas. Most people can't afford to express these opinions without risk
   of losing their jobs or being shunned by their communities, and
   unfortunately practicing lawyers, therapists, teachers and others whose
   insights would be extremely useful also have too much to lose by
   entering the debate.

   Much of the support I have received has been in the form of calls,
   emails and private messages on social media. One nasty aspect of
   Twitter, which is mostly where I have been responding to comments, is
   that if anyone dares support me or even send me a friendly "hang in
   there" tweet, the Twitter mob immediately descends upon them as well.
   And then the Twitter mob takes the lack of supportive comments in my
   feed as further evidence that I must be wrong. Some of the major
   bloggers on Twitter have privately expressed to me that they feel my
   article is being treated very unfairly by Think Progress
   ([93]@thinkprogress), Media Matters ([94]@mmfa) and others, but they
   can't afford to enter the fray.

   [95]My Twitter feed has been a tsunami of very ugly harassment, in the
   form of name calling and even threats. Someone keeps signing me up for
   porn and deviant sites to make me look like a pervert. So yes,
   supporters would like to contribute to the dialogue but feel
   intimidated.

   Have any of the messages or pieces in response to your op-ed resonated
   with you or made you question or rethink your position?

   Yes, some of the more thoughtful comments have made me question my
   position.  It is a very uncomfortable and uncharted position to be
   suggesting that something as taboo as student-teacher sex might be
   better addressed, in certain circumstances, with decriminalization. But
   that doesn't mean the idea shouldn't be discussed. One thing I seem to
   have gotten dead right is the impossibility of having a civil dialogue
   on the topic. And though I never intended to offend or hurt the victim
   community, some of their messages have resonated deeply (more on that
   later).

   All of the evidence in your article was anecdotal. Do you have any
   concrete data or evidence to support your claim that teenage girls are
   not "horribly damaged" from relationships with their teachers?

   No, I am not aware of any studies that examine the psychological
   effects of consensual sexual relations between teachers and students.
   But the individuals I referred to seemed happy and well-adjusted and
   they have gone on to have good careers and family lives. And I have
   also heard and read stories about how the criminalization and resulting
   stigmatization of teacher-student affairs caused tremendous emotional
   suffering and ruined lives. A number of the emails and messages I have
   received in response to the piece have also contributed stories along
   these lines, some very poignant. While this is still all anecdotal,
   these real-life examples suggest that the issue is not black and white
   and deserves to be discussed openly and without rancor.

   As a lawyer, do you think it's feasible that this sort of relationship
   between an adult and minor can be decriminalized? Why or why not?

   From a theoretical point of view, I think it is potentially feasible
   with a concerted effort by politicians, educators, and mental health
   professionals to formulate a rational legal and institutional
   framework. People would have to agree on what age or other
   circumstances would constitute rape or abuse per se, how the questions
   of fact concerning whether consent was present would be determined, and
   by whom. They would have to consider the question of how a teacher's
   special position of trust and authority over students would factor into
   this analysis. One thought I had is that perhaps there should be a
   rebuttable presumption of lack of consent that could only be overcome
   with clear evidence. (A rebuttable presumption is legal assumption that
   is taken to be true unless evidence proves otherwise.)

   The problem is, legislators react to high-visibility issues like rape
   with far-ranging legislation fueled by rhetoric and political
   expediency.  Once embedded, these laws become hard (or impossible) to
   rein in (think mandatory sentencing or drug laws). What politician is
   eager to take the initiative to revoke or dilute criminal legislation?
   He or she would endure what I am currently enduring, with no political
   capital to gain.

   Are you in favor of completely changing the legal age of consent from
   18?

   Yes, 18 seems extremely unrealistic in today's culture. In some states
   it is already 17 or 16. The age of consent in most European countries
   ranges from 14 to 16.

   Any regrets about submitting this op-ed? Would you do it again?

   My main regrets relate to whether I could have stated my opinions more
   clearly and in language designed to lessen the strong emotional impact.
   Some people, especially abuse victims, expressed feeling hurt and
   negated by reading the piece, which I deeply regret. As one friend of
   mine who is an abuse victim pointed out, merely raising these topics is
   hurtful to some.

   In hindsight, if space limitations had allowed, I should have included
   a qualifying paragraph stating that I was not condoning rape,
   harassment or abuse of any kind, and that I did not intend in any way
   to place the responsibility for abuse on victims. But generally op-eds
   get right to the point. Also, if I had the opportunity to rewrite the
   piece, although I did refer to Morales's death as "tragic and deeply
   troubling," I would even further to underscore that my ideas were
   coming from a place of empathy.

   And now for a little bit about yourself: How long have you been living
   in D.C. and what neighborhood do you live in? What do you do here?

   I quit my 16-year career as a lawyer in 1998 to go to art school. While
   practicing law I represented plaintiffs in personal injury, product
   liability, unfair insurance claims practices, and civil rights cases.
   Just for the record, since so many have assumed I must have been
   drummed out of the legal profession, I was A.V. rated by
   Martindale-Hubbell (meaning the highest peer review rating for
   competence and ethics) until my retirement with no blemishes on my
   record. I am now a painter and live in Dupont Circle. I've also been a
   beginner at guitar for 30 years.

       Teachers DO NOT have sexual relations with underaged students.
       EVER. Under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. If you do not understand that, I
       want you NOWHERE NEAR a school or an underaged student. Period.

       You keep using that word, "consensual," I do not think you know
       what it means. A 14 year old cannot consent to sex with a 49 year
       old. The sex is inherently not consensual. I am not a parent, but
       if someone acting "in loco parentis" came onto my kid I'd do
       everything in my power to put them behind bars, not just get them
       fired. There should be dire consequences for them preying on
       children and stealing their childhood.

       Betsy... If you ever come and read this, please hear me out. I'm
       sure you've heard this before, but I want to talk about this...
       I quote from your WP article:
       "As protesters decry the leniency of Rambold's sentence... I find
       myself troubled for the opposite reason"
       You state very clearly that you are in favor for more leniency of
       his sentence. This clearly insinuates that you think a sentence of
       30 days for "sexual intercourse without consent" (otherwise known
       as Rape), is too harsh.
       The rest of your article is about a totally different matter about
       CONSENSUAL sexual relationships between a teacher and a student.
       There is no correlation. The only reasons I can think of for this
       is:
       1. You didn't fully understand the case. (in which case you
       shouldn't have even written about it in the first place)
       2. You truly think that these two things are the same. (in which
       case, I believe you deserve every bit of negative attention that
       you've received)
       You meant to tie your thoughts about CONSENSUAL sex in school with
       the case above in order to draw discussion. However, because of
       your mistake, everyone ends up misunderstanding what you say you
       "meant" to write about. Truthfully, if you truly say what you
       "meant" to say above, your article is horribly written. I advise
       you drop writing these articles before you publicly humiliate
       yourself again...

       "So although I have no way to corroborate this, I strongly
       suspected that the pressure of the criminal proceedings may have
       had a harmful impact on Ms. Morales' state of mind and helped push
       her to commit suicide."
       "No, I am not aware of any studies that examine the psychological
       effects of consensual sexual relations between teachers and
       students."
       Shorter Karasik: "Facts? I don't need no facts! I don't got to show
       you any steenkin' facts!"
       To sum up: Betsy Karasik writes an op/ed opportunistically using
       the tragedy of a girl who was raped and then committed suicide to
       suggest that her assailant's sentence was too lenient (as Charles
       points out above), and that consensual sex (which, by definition,
       is NOT rape) between students and teachers is not a big deal, based
       on the unsourced anecdotal evidence of some rhetorical devices, er,
       FRIENDS. Of course, we don't know if these friends were 14 or 21 at
       the time of these alleged encounters.
       Which is sort of the point when sussing out the difference between
       consent and rape. Children cannot give consent. That's why they
       don't sign binding contracts. (Something you'd think a former
       attorney would be clear on.) Do teens have sexual feelings? Sure.
       But ADULTS who are in a position of authority are not supposed to
       violate that trust by sleeping with underage kids. Why is this such
       a mystifying law for Karasik to understand?
       She then makes the completely
       unsupported-by-anything-but-gut-hunches claim that it was the
       prosecution of Cherice Morales' assailant that led to her suicide,
       not the fact that she was raped.
       Or possibly -- and this is just MY hunch -- perhaps Morales'
       assailant sensed some emotional vulnerability in her and, like many
       who prey on underage people over whom they have authority, such as
       Jerry Sandusky, he played on that to make assaulting her easier.
       But anyway, priests and politicians do it all the time, so why
       should we try to control educators who want to sleep with their
       underage students? I mean, a slap on the wrist and a loss of your
       job, but it's not a legitimate rape in Karasik's eyes. Nothing we
       have to get all jail-time about.
       And some people were mean to her on social media, so that means she
       was "distorted" and is the real victim here.
       Um, no. You weren't "distorted." You wrote an incoherent screed
       based on a dog's lunch of unsupported assumptions and offensive
       premises and rightly got called out for it. But maybe with 30
       years' more practice, you might begin to get a handle on this whole
       "thinking it through, backing it up with demonstrable data, and
       writing clearly and sensitively" thing.

       I was harmed by a 'consensual' sexual relationship with a teacher
       in my high school. I certainly didn't announce this to any of my
       classmates, so it is no wonder Ms. Karasik never heard any
       complaints from her classmates. I was ashamed and damaged and the
       events warped my life. Predators prey on the weak; it is part of a
       school's job to protect the students from victimization, especially
       by those whose salaries are paid with the students families' tax
       money. I am glad Ms. Karasik doesn't know what it is like to be on
