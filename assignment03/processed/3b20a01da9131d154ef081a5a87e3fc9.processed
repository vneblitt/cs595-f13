Lessons from Iraq, Libya loom large as diplomats ponder Syrian weapons probe

   [296][TS-Par7657788.jpg]

   Video: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister
   Sergey Lavrov reached an agreement Saturday on a framework for Syria to
   destroy all of its chemical weapons.

By [297]Joby Warrick, E-mail the writer

   When Moammar Gaddafi renounced chemical weapons in 2003, the Libyan
   dictator surprised skeptics by moving quickly to eliminate his
   country's toxic arsenal. He signed international treaties, built a
   disposal facility and allowed inspectors to oversee the destruction of
   tons of mustard gas.

   But Gaddafi's public break with weapons of mass destruction was not all
   that it seemed. Only after his death in 2011 did investigators learn
   that he had retained a large stash of chemical weapons. In a hillside
   bunker deep in Libya's southeastern desert, Gaddafi had tucked away
   hundreds of battle-ready warheads loaded with deadly sulfur mustard.

   [300]Fighting in Syria: Violence escalates between government and
   opposition forces in key Syrian cities.

   The story of Gaddafi's deception now looms over nascent efforts to
   devise a plan for destroying the chemical arsenal of Syrian President
   Bashar al-
   Assad, another strongman who, in a stunning reversal, [301]agreed in
   principle last week to give up his stockpile under U.S. and Russian
   pressure.

   Arms control experts say the experience of Libya and other former
   chemical weapons states such as Iraq could be instructive -- in ways
   good and bad -- as diplomats map out a path for finding, securing and
   destroying Syria's estimated 1,000 metric tons of chemical agents. Many
   also fear that clearing Syria of its chemical weapons could prove to be
   uniquely challenging, in part because the inspectors would be dropped
   into the middle of a war zone.

   "Never has there been an experience like this one," said Daryl Kimball,
   director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based nonprofit
   organization. "With Syria, you have a country that did not even
   acknowledge having chemical weapons until recently. It had no intention
   of giving up its arsenal until there was a threat of military force.
   The schedules are being accelerated. And there's a civil war going on."

   The task of eliminating weapons as dangerous as [302]sarin or [303]VX
   can be onerous even in the best of circumstances. The United States,
   which agreed 20 years ago to eliminate its vast, Cold War-era
   stockpile, still has not completed the task despite spending billions
   of dollars on state-of-the-art incinerators. Russia, too, is years
   behind schedule in eliminating an arsenal that once contained 40,000
   metric tons of toxic compounds. A handful of other countries, including
   Japan, India and Albania, have also destroyed their chemical arsenals.

   Yet weapons experts point to the successes in Iraq after the 1991 Gulf
   War and, ultimately, in Libya -- two countries in which inspections
   teams overcame obstacles on their way to destroying large chemical
   arsenals. Iraq's weapons programs were scrutinized by two separate
   U.N.-
   appointed inspections regimes, one from 1991 to 1997 and another from
   2002 to early 2003, before U.S. forces invaded the country in part
   because of a belief that Iraq still retained weapons of mass
   destruction.

   In what was perhaps a preview of events in Syria, weapons officials in
   Iraq managed to complete the task in spite of local hostility and
   widespread chaos in a country shattered by war, said Charles Duelfer, a
   leader of the Iraq Survey Group, which searched for weapons of mass
   destruction in Iraq after the 2003 invasion. The group found and
   secured a small quantity of abandoned and damaged chemical weapons but
   uncovered no evidence of ongoing programs.
