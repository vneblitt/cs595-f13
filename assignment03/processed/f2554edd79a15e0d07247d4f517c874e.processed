Saving For College: Graduating With the Least Amount of Debt

   By Katie Bryan, [56]America Saves

   By June most recent high school graduates know what college they are
   going to, but many of them may still not know how they are going to pay
   for it. We've heard the stats that the average debt students have upon
   graduation has skyrocketed to $35,200, according to a [57]recent
   Fidelity survey, and that the costs of attending college increase 6%
   each year. College is still a great investment for most students,
   especially with some planning ahead of time to help keep debt to a
   minimum. It's still true that those with a bachelor's degree will earn
   $1 Million more over their lifetime than those who only complete high
   school.

   The challenge is to graduate with as little debt as possible. Here are
   three ways to help keep student debt to a minimum:

   1.     Create a College Savings Plan

   Just like savings for retirement, it's good to save early and often.
   There are many ways out there to help you save, from a [58]529 account
   to [59]Savings Bonds. Tip to find extra money to save: If you can save
   an extra $300 a year ($25 a month at 5% interest, compounded monthly
   for 18 years) you will have an extra $8,766.43 to put towards tuition
   bills.

   Haven't created a college savings plan yet? [60]Pledge to Save with
   America Saves and you can set your savings goal and create a plan to
   reach it. You can even sign up for text message tips and reminders to
   help you reach your goal of saving for college.

   2.     Shop Around For Schools and Free Money

   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [61]created a tool to compare
   the costs of different colleges. Their tool will let you compare
   financial aid offers so you can see how all those numbers impact your
   payments down the road.

   Apply for as many scholarships as you can. $500 here and $1,000 there
   can go a long way to helping pay for college. Many students also stop
   looking for scholarships once they enter college, but keep applying
   each year. Need some inspiration? Check out the article "[62]How I won
   $100,000+ in college scholarships" by Ramit Sethi.

   3.     Find Ways to Reduce Spending (or Earn Money) While in College

   Live at Home - Living on campus can cost anywhere from $7,500 to $9,000
   per year. Consider living at home during college (if you can) and you
   can save nearly $40,000. You can still get a full college experience by
   joining clubs and being active on campus.

   Get a Part-Time Job - Look for a job on campus or a paid internship to
   supplement your income and pay for expenses like food, books, and
   incidentals while in college. The more you can pay upfront the less
   your monthly loan payments will be when you graduate. Need more ways to
   save? We've got a list of [63]54 ways to save here.

   America Saves, managed by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), is
   a non-profit research-based social marketing campaign that seeks to
   motivate, support, and encourage low- to moderate-income households to
   save money and build wealth. Learn more at [64]americasaves.org
