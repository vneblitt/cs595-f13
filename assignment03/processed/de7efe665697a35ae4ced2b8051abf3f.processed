   The Chicago Public Schools has 36,000 solutions to help its kids deal
   with the terrible heat: tiny portable fans.

   And a first-grader who used one of the fans ended up with a haircut.

   Shortly after the fans were distributed at Smyser Elementary School,
   where only the upper grades have air conditioning, a 6-year-oldâs hair
   got caught in her fan and her teacher had to cut it out, according to
   the girlâs mother, Suzanne Kusar.

   Not every CPS school is fully air-conditioned, so as this weekâs temps
   tied record highs, the district amassed 36,000 personal fans and handed
   them out to at least 33 schools that requested them, according to
   district spokeswoman Keiana Barrett.

   The foam-bladed fans, 17,200 of which were distributed, were donated,
   according to Barrett. She could not immediately name the donor.

   Smyser received about 480 fans and handed them out Wednesday morning,
   when the heat fell short of 90 degrees, slightly cooler than Tuesdayâs
   whopping 95 degrees, Kusar said.

   Kusar said her daughter told her that kids were putting the fans in
   their mouths and the fans were taken away.

   She told her mom that the teacher told kids: âKeep these at home
   tomorrow. Do not bring them back.â

   Kusar said the idea that handheld fans would be a solution to the heat
   was âevidence of CPSâ disconnect.â

   Boone Elementary also received 480 fans on Wednesday, according to a
   school staffer.

   The district handed out 800 regular-size fans to schools that asked for
   them.

   CPS said 330 schools are fully air-conditioned and 153 schools have
   partial air conditioning. Forty schools are not air-conditioned, but
   they can request fans.

   Boone is listed as having partial air conditioning, [81]according to a
   list CPS provided in December to the school utilization commission that
   recommended which schools to close. About 50 schools that received
   children from the 47 elementary schools and one high school program
   that closed in June were supposed to get full air conditioning over the
   summer.

   Meanwhile, CPS has provided heat protocol recommendations to all
   schools. Unlike some suburban districts, city schools have remained
   open on these unusually hot days.

   âWe encourage parents to keep their children in class to ensure they
   not only receive the critical instruction they need, but our schools
   provide a safe environment with the nutrition and hydration students
   need to be as comfortable as possible,â CPS spokeswoman Becky Carroll
   said in a prepared statement.
