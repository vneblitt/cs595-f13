   A joint publication of the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S.
   Department of Education

   An education beyond high school is an investment in your future. It can
   be expensive and often requires you or your family to take out loans to
   help pay for it.

   Student loans fall into two categories, federal loans and private
   loans.
     * Federal loans, which are subject to oversight and regulation by the
       federal government, include:
          + Direct Loans, where the U.S. Department of Education is the
            lender;
          + Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), where private lenders
            make loans backed by the federal government; and
          + Federal Perkins Loans.
     * Private loans, sometimes referenced as "alternative loans," are
       offered by private lenders and do not include the benefits and
       protections available with federal loans.

   Whether you're taking out a new student loan or consolidating existing
   education loans, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's
   consumer protection agency, and the U.S. Department of Education (ED),
   the agency that oversees federal student loans, want you to know how to
   spot potentially deceptive claims or business practices some private
   companies may use to get your loan business.

Private Loans

   Private companies may offer you loans and other forms of financial
   assistance for your education. They often use direct mail marketing,
   telemarketing, television, radio, and online advertising to promote
   their products.

   Paying for your education is a serious long-term financial obligation;
   that's why comparing the costs of different ways of financing your
   education is so important. Private loans tend to have higher fees and
   interest rates than federal government loans. Private loans also do not
   offer the opportunities for cancellation or loan forgiveness that are
   available on many federal loan programs. So it makes good financial
   sense to exhaust your federal loan options (as well as grants and
   scholarships) before considering loans from any private companies. To
   learn more about federal government loans, visit [16]StudentAid.gov.

How to Spot Deceptive Private Student Loan Practices

   If you are considering a private student loan, it's important to know
   whom you're doing business with and the terms of the loan. The FTC and
   ED offer these tips to help you recognize deceptive private student
   loan practices.
     * Some private lenders and their marketers use names, seals, logos,
       or other representations similar to those of government agencies to
       create the false or misleading impression that they are part of or
       affiliated with the federal government and its student loan
       programs. ED does not send advertisements or mailers, or otherwise
       solicit consumers to borrow money. If you receive a student loan
       solicitation, it is not from ED.
     * Don't let promotions or incentives like [17]gift cards, [18]credit
       cards, and [19]sweepstakes prizes divert you from assessing whether
       the key terms of the loan are reasonable.
     * Don't give out personal information on the phone, through the mail,
       or over the Internet unless you know with whom you are dealing.
       Private student lenders typically ask for your student account
       number -- often your Social Security number (SSN) or Personal
       Identification Number (PIN) -- saying they need it to help
       determine your eligibility. However, because scam artists who
       purport to be private student lenders can misuse this information,
       it is critical to provide it or other personal information only if
       you have confidence in the private student lender with whom you are
       dealing.
     * Check out the track record of particular private student lenders
       with your [20]state Attorney General, your [21]local consumer
       protection agency, and the [22]Better Business Bureau.

Special Considerations for Consolidation of Federal Loans

   Student loan consolidation is combining several loans into one with a
   new repayment term and interest rate. This is generally offered in
   connection with federal loans. Here's how to help identify potential
   problems related to loan consolidation:
     * Avoid lenders and marketers who use high-pressure sales tactics.
       Some marketers pitch that "your interest rates may go up if you do
       not consolidate immediately!" Whether and when interest rates for
       consolidating your loans will change depends on what type of loans
       you have. Look at your loan documents to determine whether the
       interest rates are fixed or variable:
          + If all of your education loans have fixed interest rates,
            there may be no deadline to consolidate.
          + If some or all of your loans have variable interest rates,
            when you consolidate into a fixed loan it may affect the
            interest rate of your loan. ED publishes new variable rates
            for some federal loans each July 1st. The annual rate changes
            can raise or lower the interest rate offered on a consolidated
            loan because the consolidation interest rate will be the
            weighted average of all loans consolidated.

   Whether or not you have a targeted timeframe, take your time to
   determine whether consolidating is right for you.
     * Some lenders impose restrictions on promised discounts. Some may
       disclose these limits only in the fine print. Read the fine print
       in your loan documents to find these types of conditions:
          + Some lenders lower the interest rate on your consolidated
            loan, but only if you opt for automated payments from your
            checking account.
          + Other lenders discount the interest rate on your consolidated
            loan, but only if your loan has at least a specified minimum
            loan balance.
          + Still others agree to lower the interest rate on your
            consolidated loan, but only if you remain current on your
            payments for the life of the loan. You may want to consider
            loans with more immediate discounts, a shorter on-time payment
            period for interest rate discounts, or an additional discount
            for signing up for automatic payments.
     * Some lenders sell consolidated loans to other companies. Because
       benefits of consolidated loans -- like promised discounts -- may
       not transfer, you may lose benefits if the lender sells your loan.
       Ask the lender whether the terms of your loan will change if it is
       sold.
     * Be cautious about consolidating federal loans and private loans
       into one private loan. The result of consolidating all loans into
       one non-federal private loan means that you lose all the benefits
       and protections provided in the federal loan programs.
     * Consolidating a Perkins loan may not be in your best interest. You
       may lose unique deferment and cancellation rights available to
       Perkins loan borrowers. For more information about these rights
       visit [23]www.myeddebt.com/borrower.
     * Frequent consolidation after borrowing may impact timelines you
       need to meet to qualify for these benefits.
