   House ethics panel extends Roskam case

   By Katherine Skiba Tribune reporter

   7:29 a.m. CDT, September 12, 2013

    WASHINGTON -- The House Ethics Committee said today it would continue
   its review of a $25,000-plus trip to Taiwan taken by Rep. Peter Roskam
   and his wife in 2011.

   Roskam, 51, a Wheaton Republican who entered Congress in 2007,  ranks
   No. 4 in his party's House leadership.

   The crux of the ethics review is who paid for an official, eight-day
   trip taken by Roskam and his wife, Elizabeth, at a time when their
   daughter, Gracey, was teaching in Taiwan.

   The committee announced on July 26 that the independent Office of
   Congressional Ethics had referred a "matter" pertaining to Roskam to
   the committee on June 13.

   Under the rules, the committee had 45 days from the July 26
   announcement to announce a course of action. That deadline was today.

   What is significant about today's announcement is that the ethics
   committee, so far, has not dismissed the Roskam case. Rather, its
   release today said it was gathering additional information necessary to
   complete its review.

   At the time Roskam's name surfaced in July, his spokeswoman Stephanie
   Kittredge said the lawmaker "fully complied with all laws, rules and
   procedures" governing congressional trips that are sponsored by private
   sources.

   Additionally, Roskam released several pages of the Office of
   Congressional Ethics in July.

   Roskam and his lawyers maintained in documents that the Chinese Culture
   University in Taipei sponsored the couple's trip, a mix of meetings
   with government officials and sightseeing.

   But the Office of Congressional Ethics, whose own investigation
   resulted in the referral to the House Ethics Committee, contended that
   the Roskam trip may have constituted an "impermissible gift" because of
   the involvement of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
   Office in the United States. TECRO is an arm of Taiwan's government.

   Under the rules governing official travel, foreign governments cannot
   pay for lawmaker trips except when the excursions are cultural
   exchanges authorized under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange
   Act, or MECEA. Under such trips, however, no travel money can flow to a
   family member of a lawmaker. Roskam's trip was not a MECEA trip.

   Roskam, who has regularly traveled overseas while in Congress, made the
   Taiwan trip with his wife Oct. 15-22, 2011, at a cost of $25,653.

   The couple flew first-class, Meagan Holder, another Roskam spokeswoman,
   told the Tribune.

   Gracey Roskam is now the assistant to the executive director of the
   National Republican Congressional Committee, said Annie Clark, an NRCC
   spokeswoman. The committee tries to elect Republicans to the House.
