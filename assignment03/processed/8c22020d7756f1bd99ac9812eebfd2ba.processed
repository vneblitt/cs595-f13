   North Wildwood, 8-27-2013. (Transcript Below)
   Governor Christie: Part of what I want I'm going to be doing this week,
   is to get out and around the state with two messages. First, is that
   for those folks who didn't believe that we could have a summer in 2013
   here in New Jersey, through all the hard work of people at local,
   state, and federal government, individual citizens, we've been able to
   have a really good summer on the Jersey Shore especially here in the
   southern part of the state. But secondly, to also remind people that
   because we had a good summer from a business perspective in many parts
   of the state, doesn't mean for a second that we're forgetting the
   people whose lives are still turned upside down by this storm. They are
   still thousands of people who are not back in their homes, people who
   are still trying to grapple with the damage and the loss from Sandy,
   and we're continuing everyday through the grant programs that we have
   to help those folks. And I won't rest until all those people are able
   to make their own decision about whether they want to get back in their
   home or whether they want to move on to something else. And we have to
   be able to do both at the same time everybody. If we waited for
   everyone to have their lives return to normal before we started to
   market our state and help these businesses, these businesses around us
   wouldn't be open. People wouldn't come. If we haven't had this tourism
   campaign that we've had, if we hadn't done the things that we needed to
   do to let people know that we can walk and chew gum at the same time.
   You know we can promote our businesses, and promote the good things
   that we've done while also acknowledging that there's more work to do.
