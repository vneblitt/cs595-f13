   You can conserve resources, save energy, and prevent waste by buying
   products that:
     * Are energy efficient
     * Are used or reusable
     * Are made with recycled content or are recyclable
     * Have no packaging or reduced packaging

Everything you buy affects the environment, but some choices are better than
others.

Did You Know?

   Since your parents were born, the amount of trash each American
   generates has doubled.*

   "Green purchasing" means buying smart. Shop with the environment in
   mind--that is, buy products that help conserve natural resources, save
   energy, and prevent waste. Green purchasing can also mean not buying
   things you don't need. By educating yourself about the products you
   buy, you can make a difference in protecting the environment.

   Green purchasing involves learning about all the ways that a product
   can affect the environment during the course of its "life cycle"--from
   the materials used to manufacture it, to how you use it, to what you do
   with it when you're finished with it--so that you can make smart
   choices.

   Use the tips and resources in this brochure to make yourself an
   educated consumer.

Shopping Tips

   Buy smart. Take some time to think before you buy something--maybe you
   don't really need it. Maybe you can think of an alternative to buying a
   product, such as renting a DVD instead of buying it or sending a free
   e-card instead of a paper birthday card. Shopping with the environment
   in mind will conserve resources, prevent waste, and save money.

   Buy durable products. Instead of buying disposable products, which are
   wasteful, buy things that will last a long time, such as rechargeable
   batteries and reusable plastic mugs for drinks.

   Avoid excess packaging. Look for products that have less packaging, or
   buy in bulk--you'll have less to throw away. You can also buy items
   with packaging that can be reused or recycled.

   Buy used. Buying things that have been used before means that your
   purchase doesn't use more resources or energy. If the item is still
   reusable when you're through with it, then the next person to use it is
   not using additional resources either. You can find authentic retro
   clothes, room accessories, and even sports equipment at your local
   thrift store. Shop online or at local stores to buy used CDs and books.

   Share with friends. Another way to save resources and energy is to swap
   with friends and family instead of buying brand-new products. Maybe you
   and your friends like the same video games. Why not share your games
   instead of each of you owning the same game? Or maybe you can rent the
   game first to see if you really want to own it.

   Buy energy-efficient items. Look for the ENERGY STAR® logo when buying
   electronics such as TVs, CD players, DVD players, and computers.
   [21]ENERGY STAR is a program designed to identify and promote
   energy-efficient products.

Did You Know?

   For every 42 notebooks made with 100 percent recycled paper, one tree
   is saved.*

   Buy recycled. Buying items made with recycled-content materials means
   that fewer natural resources, such as trees, were used to produce the
   products. Products made from recycled paper, plastic, and other
   materials are usually easy to recognize in the store--just read the
   labels. Try starting with school supplies. Many stores carry recycled
   notebooks, pens, and other products.

How do my purchases make a difference?

Did You Know?

   Young people spend or influence the spending of $300 billion a year, or
   about 1 in 3 dollars spent.*

   Buying "green" lets companies know that you care about the
   environmental impact of the products you buy. Why would a big
   corporation care what you think? Because your current and future
   purchasing power is extremely important to them. In fact, companies
   spend $12 billion a year marketing their products to you.* Shopping
   "green" sends a message to the companies--that you care about the
   environment, and you're not afraid to use your buying power to prove
   it.

Did You Know?

   67 percent of parents buying a new car base their decision on advice
   from their kids, who are not even old enough to drive.*

   Your purchasing choices affect what your parents buy. Your parents buy
   groceries and other items based on your likes and dislikes, and they
   might even buy a car input from you and your siblings. Your friends
   also listen to what you have to say when they decide what to buy. Use
   your influence to help others shop smart and protect the environment.
