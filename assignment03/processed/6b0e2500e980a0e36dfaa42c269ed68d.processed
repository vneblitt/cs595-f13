The Library of Congress Launches @TeachingLC, Its New Twitter Feed for K-12
Educators

   September 12, 2013 by [14]Stephen Wesson

   Sharing ideas is a critical part of all great teaching, and now the
   Library of Congress has a new tool for exchanging ideas with the
   nation‚s K-12 teachers: @TeachingLC, its new Twitter feed for
   educators.

   The Library‚s Director of Educational Outreach, Lee Ann Potter, hailed
   the launch. ‚Teachers and librarians use Twitter to discover new ideas
   and inspiration, and we at the Library are happy to be joining the
   conversation. @TeachingLC will be a great venue for educators to learn
   from each other and to explore the primary sources and teaching
   resources offered by the Library of Congress.‚

   Discover and discuss primary sources like this at @TeachingLC

   The new Twitter feed will highlight intriguing primary sources,
   showcase new tools for teachers, and spark discussion between the
   nation‚s K-12 educators and Library experts.

   ‚There is always something new to discover at the Library of Congress,
   and we‚re looking forward to working with teachers to find new ways to
   fuel student learning and encourage their discoveries.‚

   The Library of Congress makes available millions of digitized artifacts
   from across world history and culture, all for free. Primary sources
   like these have tremendous power to capture students‚ attention and to
   build their critical thinking and analysis skills.

   To help teachers bring these primary sources to life in their
   classrooms, the Library offers free teaching tools and professional
   learning opportunities on its Web site for teachers,
   [15]loc.gov/teachers.

   We hope you'll follow us and spread the word! Meanwhile, let us know
   what you'd like to hear about in @TeachingLC.
