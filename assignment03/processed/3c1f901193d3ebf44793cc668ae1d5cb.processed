Statewide ISAT scores plummet after bar is raised

Only 4th-graders notch passing rate above 60 percent

   School Report Image

   10:02 p.m. CDT, September 10, 2013

   State exam scores plunged to record lows across most grades after the
   state raised the bar for passing the spring 2013 exams for third-
   through eighth-graders, according to results released Tuesday.

   Overall, math scores took the biggest hit on the Illinois Standards
   Achievement Tests, which were given in March. The steepest drop was for
   third-graders taking the math test, state officials reported. Only 54.9
   percent of them passed, compared with 87.7 percent the year before.

   The percentage of students passing reading and math tests in each of
   the other grades fell to about 59 percent, compared with the
   mid-to-high 70s and 80s in prior years.

   Only one grade, fourth, posted a passing rate above 60 percent -- 60.2
   percent on the math exam, according to results released by the Illinois
   State Board of Education.

   The Tribune reported the big drops in scores in a story last week,
   based on information from local school districts.

   In a morning call with news reporters, State School Superintendent
   Christopher Koch stressed that the declines were expected because the
   state pushed up the scores required to pass each of the grade school
   exams in reading and math. The threshold to pass or "meet standards"
   varies by test and grade and is based on the number of correct answers
   that correspond to a particular score.

   After the scores required to pass were boosted by 13 to 30 points,
   thousands more students flunked.

   "The new expectations do not mean that our students know less or are
   less capable than they were in previous years," Koch said.

   Raising the bar to pass the grade school exams better prepares students
   for high school and keeps them on track for college, careers and daily
   life, he said.

   State officials said students have steadily improved their performance
   on most reading and math exams. That is based on an analysis that
   converts test results from prior years -- applying the new passing
   requirements -- so they can be compared with the 2013 exam results.

   Science exams for fourth- and seventh-graders were not affected by the
   new passing requirements. Fourth-graders improved their performance,
   with 81 percent of students passing, up from 79.8 the year before.

   The state board also released statewide passing rates for 11th-graders
   who take the Prairie State Achievement Examinations, showing about half
   of juniors passed in 2013. Passing requirements stayed the same for the
   Prairie State.

   The 11th-graders posted the largest gains in reading, with 54.8 percent
   of students passing, compared with 50.7 percent the year before. The
   passing rate in math was 51.8 percent, compared with 51.6 percent the
   year before.

   In science, performance dropped to a 49.3 percent passing rate,
   compared with 51.7 percent the year before.

   ISAT scores for local school districts are not made public by the state
   until the end of October, though districts may release them earlier.
   Districts distribute schoolchildren's individual score reports; the
   date for issuing those results varies by district.

   The state is moving to a new online testing system scheduled for
   2014-15; the ISAT exam, which debuted in 1999, will be shelved.

   In the spring of 2014, students will take the last but more rigorous
   ISAT, with questions based on a new and more difficult standards for
   what they need to know.
