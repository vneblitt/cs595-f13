UN will continue relief work in Syria despite dangerous conditions, top

   6 September 2013 - The United Nations humanitarian chief today
   reiterated the Organization's commitment to continue its relief
   operations inside Syria, as well as in neighbouring countries, adding
   that protecting civilians is paramount amid the spiralling violence.

   "Syria and its neighbouring countries are going through a humanitarian
   crisis on a scale we have rarely seen," Under-Secretary-General for
   Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos told
   reporters in New York in a teleconference from Beirut, Lebanon.

   "The fighting is having a terrible impact on ordinary people.
   Neighbourhoods have been shelled indiscriminately and entire towns have
   been besieged."

   Ms. Amos, who is just back from a visit to Syria, stressed that despite
   the "very difficult and dangerous conditions," humanitarian aid
   organizations are committed to continuing their work. The UN currently
   has some 4,500 staff in Syria working with non-governmental and
   community organizations to help people who need it the most in both
   Government and opposition-controlled areas.

   "Inside Syria, protecting civilians is paramount. The rise in the level
   of sectarian and sexual violence and ongoing human rights abuses are a
   major concern," Ms. Amos said.

   More than one third of Syrians urgently need humanitarian aid but the
   crisis is affecting everyone, she said, as the currency has
   significantly depreciated and essential infrastructure has been
   destroyed, including health facilities.

   During her visit, Ms. Amos met with members of the Government and
   humanitarian partners, with whom she discussed ways to improve aid
   operations.

   "I had positive meetings with the Government and hope we will make
   progress in addressing some of the administrative challenges we have
   faced in getting approval for field operations, convoys and visas for
   humanitarian aid workers," she said.

   Since fighting began in March 2011 between the Syrian Government and
   opposition groups seeking to oust President Bashar Al-Assad as many as
   100,000 people have been killed, more than 2 million have fled to
   neighbouring countries and a further 4 million have been internally
   displaced. In addition, at least 6.8 million Syrian require urgent
   humanitarian assistance, half of whom are children.

   Ms. Amos added that the refugee crisis is having a very damaging effect
   on the economy on the social structure of host communities and as the
   number of people fleeing the country continues to escalate, she urged
   the international community to boost their support for the refugee
   appeal.
