Inside the March on Washington: âOur Support Really Ran Deepâ

   August 26, 2013 by [14]Erin Allen

   (The following is a guest post by Guha Shankar, folklife specialist in
   the American Folklife Center and the Libraryâs Project Director of the
   [15]Civil Rights History Project, a Congressionally mandated
   documentation initiative that is being carried out in collaboration
   with the [16]Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African
   American History and Culture.)

   Fifty years later, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom
   triggers different memories for participants and observers.Â  It is
   safe to say that for most who witnessed it, in person or at home, the
   lasting images of the march are celebratory and triumphant. Popular
   accounts in the media reinforce those memories by centering on the
   determined and proud faces of thousands of ordinary people gathered
   peacefully in the nationâs capital to demand that the country live up
   to its founding principles of justice and equality. Similarly, Dr.
   Martin Luther Kingâs âI Have a Dreamâ speech has become part of our
   collective consciousness, given the frequency with which it has been
   quoted, cited and replayed over the last 50 years.

   Behind the scenes, organizers of the march and other notable figures in
   the movement experienced a complex range of emotions and confronted
   questions that became ever more pressing as the months and weeks
   leading up to the march dwindled to hours and minutes.Â  Apprehension
   and nervousness were present and so too were elation and euphoria.
   Mostly hidden from public view were the tensions among and between the
   coalition of civic and religious leaders and front-line activists as to
   how the march could advance their goals and meet their demands for
   social change and justice.

   This is the third in a [17]series of posts that provides audiences with
   the perspectives and memories of organizers about the march through
   video and audio interviews in the collections of the [18]American
   Folklife Center.Â  The series accompanies the Libraryâs photo
   exhibition, âThe March on Washington: A Day Like No Other,â opening on
   Wednesday, Aug., 28, 2013.

   In the first clip, edited from interviews in the [19]National Visionary
   Leadership Project collection, we hear the recollections of Rev. Joseph
   Lowery and Constance Baker Motley. Lowery was a Methodist minister in
   Mobile, Ala., when he became a civil rights activist in the 1950s.Â
   Along with King and other ministers, he founded the Southern Christian
   Leadership Conference (SCLC), a leading civil rights organization.
   Lowery recalls the unease and uncertainty that he and other organizers
   felt before the march and their relief upon its peaceful conclusion.

   Constance Baker Motley grew up in Connecticut and became a civil rights
   lawyer with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
   People's (NAACP) Legal Defense Fund. She worked with Justice Thurgood
   Marshall and other lawyers to argue cases at the Supreme Court,
   including Brown v. Board of Education. She also traveled extensively
   across the country to meet with plaintiffs, gather evidence and work on
   local cases of civil rights abuses. In this interview, she reflects on
   the astonishment of movement leaders at the outpouring of feeling and
   involvement of so many âordinary peopleâ who participated in the march.

   In the second clip, drawn from the [20]Civil Rights History Project
   Collection, sisters Joyce Ann and Dorie Ladner reminisce about the
   events of August 28. The Ladners helped plan the march at its New York
   headquarters as representatives of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
   Committee (SNCC, pronounced âSnickâ), a national coalition of
   college-age activists, and were on the stage at the Lincoln Memorial
   for the march. For them, the days started off with a protest at the
   Justice Department over the case of colleagues in Americus, Ga., who
   had been jailed, weeks earlier, on false charges of sedition. The
   charges against SNCCâs Don Harris, John Perdew and Ralph Allen, and
   Congress of Racial Equality activist Zev Aelony carried a maximum
   sentence of death and SNCC chairman John Lewisâs speech later that day
   at the March criticized the Kennedy administrationâs refusal to
   intervene in this and other deadly assaults on civil rights workers and
   community members in the South.Â  Joyce Ann Ladner recalls the
   overwhelming numbers of marchers and also the presence of several
   notable figures on the stage such as Marlon Brando and Lena Horne.

   of the civil rights movement available at the [21]American Folklife
   Center and other divisions in the Library of Congress.
