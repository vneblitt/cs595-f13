Sesame Workshop Announces Partnership with Teaching Strategies

   IFRAME: [35]http://www.youtube.com/embed/y93hinehT4U

   Today Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit educational organization behind
   Sesame Street, announced a multi-year partnership with Teaching
   Strategies, the educational company that publishes The Creative
   Curriculum and Teaching Strategies GOLD. The partnership will develop a
   series of educational offerings for the preschool classroom that
   utilizes Sesame Street's proven content. Over the next five years,
   Sesame Workshop and Teaching Strategies will work together to develop
   new ways to educate young children both at home and in school.

   "We are thrilled to be partnering with Sesame Workshop, an organization
   that shares our philosophy about the critical importance of early
   childhood education and our commitment to providing early childhood
   educators, children, and their families with research-based,
   high-quality content," said Diane Trister Dodge, Founder and President
   of Teaching Strategies.

   High-quality early learning experiences at home and in school provide
   the foundation for children's future academic success. From birth to
   age five, children are making giant developmental strides, more than at
   any other time in life. During this critical window, education is the
   key to unlocking their potential.

   Over the years, Sesame Street has improved learning outcomes for the
   millions of children viewing the show, but the United States is still
   facing an educational crisis. Studies show that one in three children
   who arrive at school is simply not ready. Today's kids are spending
   more time in preschool and other child-care settings, and less time at
   home. That's why Sesame Street is partnering with Teaching Strategies.
   It's time for the positive impact of Sesame's educational content to be
   felt in schools as well.

   "Our goal is to surround kids with learning opportunities wherever they
   are," said Tom Ascheim, Chief Strategy Officer at Sesame Workshop and
   EVP of Sesame Learning. "We will be using the power and appeal of
   Sesame Street content to connect homes and classrooms, coordinating the
   efforts of teachers and families, and working to achieve measurable
   gains for children. There, we'll continue to do what we've done so
   effectively for over four decades - marry education and engagement to
   teach kids."
