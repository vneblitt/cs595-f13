Pigskins Shame Spiral: ESPN

   Posted by [86]Mike Madden on Sep. 9, 2013 at 5:04 pm

   Pigskins Shame Spiral: Fingerwag The [87]Pigskins Shame Spiral is an
   occasional feature tracking developments related to the name of D.C.'s
   beloved football team.

   Who: ESPN, the sports media behemoth (and NFL partner), whose
   [88]ombudsman reported today on an internal "campaign to have ESPN stop
   using the name."

   Change the name? Maybe. Network execs have apparently resisted so far
   for one half-decent reason and two fairly craven ones. Half-decent: The
   network should be covering news, not making it. (Though that's [89]not
   always their style.) Craven: Owner Dan "Snyder would clearly not be
   happy at such a slap in his face and might make it more difficult for
   ESPN reporters to cover the team and its star quarterback." Also
   craven: "A gesture as aggressive as attacking a famous, long-standing
   team is antithetical to the ESPN business model."

   Why? Ombudsman Robert Lipsyte doesn't use what he refers to as "the
   R-word" himself in the post, though he does use it in quotes. He also
   quotes the ESPN vice president who led the campaign, Edmundo Macedo, on
   why he started trying to raise the issue: "Think about the name. Think
   about the stereotypical connotations around color. We would not accept
   anything similar as a team nickname if it were associated with any
   other ethnicity or any other race."

   Shame Spiral Rating: Finger wag. If ESPN actually followed through and
   stopped using the name, that might be enough to make Snyder and his
   employees think twice about [90]embracing it so passionately. In
   reality, you can expect to hear frequent racial slurs on
   tonight's Monday Night Football broadcast of the team's game against
   the Philadelphia Eagles, and not just from idiotic Eagles wide
   receiver [91]Riley Cooper. Still, the fact that the network--which
   recently withdrew from a documentary on concussions, [92]reportedly
   under pressure from the league--is even considering a change internally
   ought to shame Snyder a little bit. If, that is, such a thing is
   possible.

       Funny how the poll NBC did shows a big majority of American Indians
       DON'T CARE about the name "Redskins" and DON'T find it offensive.
       Just more crying by the politically correct liberal weenies.
