Bill Moyers Essay: The End Game for Democracy

   Bill Moyers says the parody and satire of Jon Stewart and Stephen
   Colbert pay Washington the disrespect it deserves, but in the end it‚s
   the city‚s predatory mercenaries who have the last laugh.

   BILL MOYERS: We are so close to losing our democracy to the mercenary
   class, it‚s as if we are leaning way over the rim of the Grand Canyon
   and all that‚s needed is a swift kick in the pants. Look out below.

   The predators in Washington are only this far from monopoly control of
   our government. They have bought the political system, lock, stock and
   pork barrel, making change from within impossible. That‚s the real
   joke.

   Sometimes I long for the wit of a Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert. They
   treat this town as burlesque, and with satire and parody show it the
   disrespect it deserves. We laugh, and punch each other on the arm, and
   tweet that the rascals got their just dessert. Still, the last laugh
   always seems to go to the boldface names that populate this town. To
   them belong the spoils of a looted city. They get the tax breaks, the
   loopholes, the contracts, the payoffs.

   They fix the system so multimillionaire hedge fund managers and private
   equity tycoons pay less of a tax rate on their income than school
   teachers, police and fire fighters, secretaries and janitors. They give
   subsidies to rich corporate farms and cut food stamps for working
   people facing hunger. They remove oversight of the wall street casinos,
   bail out the bankers who torpedo the economy, fight the modest reforms
   of Dodd-Frank, prolong tax havens for multinationals, and stick it to
   consumers while rewarding corporations.

   We pay. We pay at the grocery store. We pay at the gas pump. We pay the
   taxes they write off. Our low-wage workers pay with sweat and
   deprivation because this town ‚ aloof, self-obsessed, bought off and
   doing very well, thank you ‚ feels no pain.

   The journalists who could tell us these things rarely do ‚ and some,
   never. They aren‚t blind, simply bedazzled. Watch the evening news ‚
   any evening news ‚ or the Sunday talk shows. Listen to the chit-chat of
   the early risers on morning TV -- and ask yourself if you are learning
   anything about how this town actually works.

   William Greider, one of our craft‚s finest reporters, fierce and
   unbought, despite a long life in Washington once said that no one can
   hope to understand what is driving political behavior without asking
   the kind of gut-level questions politicians ask themselves in private:
   ‚Who are the winners in this matter and who are the losers? Who gets
   the money and who has to pay? Who must be heard on this question and
   who can be safely ignored?‚

   Perhaps they don‚t ask these questions because they fear banishment
   from the parties and perks, from the access that passes as seduction in
   this town.

   Or perhaps they do not tell us these things because they fear that if
   the system were exposed for what it is, outraged citizens would descend
   on this town, and tear it apart with their bare hands.

       Bill Moyers, you are awesome! You have spent a lifetime exposing
       corruption and abuse and fighting for the rights of those who have
       none. Even after decades of speaking truth to power you are still
       willing to do it with the bluntness and courage it deserves. So
       long as people like you have a voice in the world true democracy
       has a fighting chance.
     * Beverly
       Everything Gene Ogorodoz wrote is TRUE-Bill Moyers, you are a real
       American Hero! Thank you!
     * Chisholm
       Bill, that is an excellent summary. I could, should have written
       it. In fact I have tried to express those facts in the local
       papers. Yes, the TV reporters are simply vacuous, pretty and
       overpaid, all looking and speaking like clones of one another. Of
       course, they take no risk in losing those jobs and the celebrity
       exposure, all so superficial. Do we ever hear any really hard
       questions or direct, brief answers? Like many others, we don't
       watch the cozy reporters clutches, even on PBS any more. We read
       books and wait for the march on D.C. when we must risk everything,
       our lives, our souls to save our sacred honor and this country from
       itself.
     * Anonymous
       I agree. But where can a seriously interested citizen obtain the
       information that would answer the questions journalists should be
       asking? In other words, who is following the money? Who is tracking
       the power exchanges? Who is doing the detailed research and
       investigative work necessary to bring these culprits, who are
       literally stealing our nation, to justice? I find isolated spots of
       good journalism here and there, but nobody seems to take the
       responsibility for doing the full-blown research that needs to be
       done to empower us to actually do something about the power grab.
     * Austin Innovator
       Sir, with all the disgust and outrage you display in this
       commentary, I have to ask:
       How
       can we, the people, change this situation? Seriously, what changes
       would be effective in correcting this `revolving door' of
       well-connected
       millionaires and wannnabes, and of corporate purchasers of power?
       A
       friend suggested term limits, but also suggested representatives be
       selected by lottery from those who want to serve ONE TERM as a
       representative. (Put your name in the hat.)
       I offered that
       the 1/3 of new Senators then be selected from those
       currently-serving
       representatives BY the representatives themselves.
       Yes, this requires a Constitutional Amendment, and yes, it is one
       suggestion of the many I'm sure you've heard.
       But,
       within the existing `system', how can THE PEOPLE make ANY change
       that
       would be effective, and what mechanism can be employed to effect
       that
       change? We have so many Social Media methods, but they all seem
       like a
       babbling throng with no true voice emerging from the din.YOU, sir,
       stand
       out from the crowd I can understand as someone who knows how the
       system
       works, and how the `fourth estate' of news and media might be used
       in
       this change.
       I, and many others, need your knowledge, your
       voice, to step up to the plate and show us how to "tear this town
       apart
       with our bare hands". We need a leader-from-behind, an Eisenhower
       willing to take on the military, monetary, industrial farm,
       oil-energy
       complex that currently OWNS our government.
       Michael J. MIllerAustin, Texas
     * Jim Young
       Perhaps we should expand (full) disclosure to include following the
       finances of former legislatures and lobbyists forever.
     * Larry Baker
       You could not have spoke better. As we celebrate the Civil Rights
       March on Washington this week. We the people should go back to the
       streets as w did in the 60's and as Egypt and Brazil did today.
     * Andre
       While your essay is spot-on in many ways, the larger question, "Who
       can we really trust?" must also extend to those like yourself who
       position themselves as champions of the people. You mention Jon
       Stewart and Stephen Colbert's poignant satire, but Mr. Stewart
       creates trusts to separate him from his money to buy multi-million
       dollar Manhattan apartments and luxury mansions. And, to be frank,
       how do we trust someone like yourself, who played one of the
       biggest deflection roles in our government - press secretary - who
       then has transformed into a champion of the people? I can't tell
       anymore who might be sincere.
       Mr. Moyers, I'm a big follower of your programming throughout the
       years and I think you fill a very critical void in our media.
       However, you have to admit, if you were not you (let's not be naive
       here - you are very well connected and I'm guessing not middle
       class either) but rather on the other side like most of us, would
       you trust anyone at all?
     * A.O.W.M.
       I certainly agree with Mr. Moyers' as-usual cogent opinions here (I
       may as well call them fact); if I could, I'd like to add that IMHO
       in one way or another Mr. Stewart, Mr. Colbert, Lewis Black, the
       late George Carlin and new satirist Le Camp probably do some harm
       along with the good. It's hard to disagree that the absolute worst
       these pundits have said and do say about (put your favorite clay
       pigeon here) is richly deserved. The unfortunate bit is that (as
       Mr. Moyers says) we laugh at their jokes and for a moment we think
       `Well, that puts ____ in their place.' It doesn't, however; the
       latest lunatic, half-wit or troll to inspire the above comedians'
       ire just keeps plugging along. All that does take a hit is the
       target's image. Once the TV show is over, it decays to their
       afterimage, and our memory of the non-event decays as well. The
       next time we tune in we're just as ticked off -- and ready to laugh
       -- as last time.
       Not very productive! It also doesn't help that in the modern era,
       thanks to the horrendous mess we're all in, the satire of Walt
       Kelly (POGO) or Anatole France (PELICAN ISLAND, et al) has been to
       an extent superseded by the ridicule of Juvenal (his sixteen
       SATIRES of first century C.E. Rome smack more of Stewart and Black
       than Mark Twain). When does ridicule become popular? Often, when
       hope of positive change is past. Maybe we'd all better think twice
       about that part. Oh, pardon me, it's time for the DAILY SHOW.
     * JonThomas
       I am certainly not Mr. Moyers or Mr. Stewart, and I hope my
       comments would not in any way dissuade either from responding if
       they saw fit.
       I do think you raise a legitimate point. Who are YOU to trust? If
       you see a measure of hypocrisy, duplicity, or lack of integrity in
       anyone's actions, you have every right to question their words AND
       actions.
       You even have a right to bring your concerns to other people's
       attention.
       However, for me, I have to judge for myself.
       I know that no one is perfect. If you are waiting for some perfect
       messiah to come along and lead to you to some perfection of Utopia,
       I feel you have a long wait.
       I know that even a person who desires to obey traffic laws could be
       forgiven the speed limit in certain situations.
       I know that what a person does at one point in life could be vastly
       different from the choices they might make, or might have made at
       another point.
       "Who can we really trust?"
       Simple, whomever YOU personally want to trust. If you think it
       better to not trust anyone...then fine, your choice.
       If however, you engage your thinking facilities, and use your own
       judgement to weigh the words and the essence of what *ANYONE* says,
       you'll find that at times, even your most repugnant enemy might
       speak words of wisdom.
       Who are you to know? I suggest, if you haven't, you read Ayn Rand.
       Many, many people, including myself, find many things here and
       there to criticize in her works. However, she elucidated a point
       which, even those who find her ideas abhorrent, and that while it
       is in the extreme, well serves many people...
       "Who am I to know?"...
       "Thinking is man‚s only basic virtue, from which all the others
       proceed. And his basic vice, the source of all his evils, is that
       nameless act which all of you practice, but struggle never to
       admit: the act of blanking out, the willful suspension of one‚s
       consciousness, the refusal to think‚not blindness, but the refusal
       to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act of
       unfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the
       responsibility of judgment‚on the unstated premise that a thing
       will not exist if only you refuse to identify it, that A will not
       be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict ‚It is.‚
       Non-thinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate existence,
       an attempt to wipe out reality. But existence exists; reality is
       not to be wiped out, it will merely wipe out the wiper. By refusing
       to say ‚It is,‚ you are refusing to say ‚I am.‚ By suspending your
       judgment, you are negating your person. When a man declares: ‚Who
       am I to know?‚ he is declaring: ‚Who am I to live?‚
       Dropping below the level of a savage, who believes that the magic
       words he utters have the power to alter reality, they believe that
       reality can be altered by the power of the words they do not
       utter‚and their magic tool is the blank-out, the pretense that
       nothing can come into existence past the voodoo of their refusal to
       identify it.
       It is not any crime you have ever committed that infects your soul
       with permanent guilt, it is none of your failures, errors or flaws,
       but the blank-out by which you attempt to evade them‚it is not any
       sort of Original Sin or unknown prenatal deficiency, but the
       knowledge and fact of your basic default, of suspending your mind,
       of refusing to think. Fear and guilt are your chronic emotions,
       they are real and you do deserve them, but they don‚t come from the
       superficial reasons you invent to disguise their cause, not from
       your ‚selfishness,‚ weakness or ignorance, but from a real and
       basic threat to your existence: fear, because you have abandoned
       your weapon of survival, guilt, because you know you have done it
       volitionally."
       When you bring into question the words of someone, based on what
       YOU see as reason for mistrust, I do hope you realize that it in no
       way diminishes their right to continue to speak out, nor does it
       diminish another person's right to to think for themselves.
       As a matter of fact, if you aren't careful, you even place yourself
       in the position of bringing rejection to your your own words.
       So...educate yourself. Teach others to educate themselves. Educate
       others.
       Instead of always finding fault, do your best to look for what is
       good in all people. You may find that such imperfect humans, such
       as the 2 you cited, are incredible sources of illumination, even if
       YOU do not want to trust them!
       Oh, and I'm sure that I will get the opposite reaction for my
       quoting of Ms. Rand.
     * Anonymous
       A court jester can only do his job which is to alert you to the
       king's arrogance. It is up to the people as to what shall come
       next. If you laugh and kick back until the next show you have
       dishonored the jester, your country and yourself. It is not Mr.
       Stewart or Mr. Colbert who shall carry the blame for this mess.

       Connections and access are helpful in gaining information. One

       people like Bill Moyers to said it like it is.
     * Anonymous
       Perhaps it is something that you can take on yourself to do the
       research. Asking MSM journalists to look for the culprits only
       leads back to their corporate masters. They aren't going to risk
       their lively hood to condemn the people who pay them.
     * Ray
       This commentary strikes me as a summation, a final word to viewers
       to carry onward with them. You're not going to retire again are
       you, Mr M? Even if that is not on the horizon, for the sake of our
       country please keep going until your last breath. Your country
       needs you, every new day more than the previous.
     * Mary Whisler Maxwell
       Once again, I thank you Mr. Moyers, for telling it like it is.
       While I enjoy the humor of Stewart and Colbert, I feel your
       straight talk is what we really need. And yes, the people will
       eventually rise up against Washington, DC, and the scene will not
       be pretty! For now, the best we can hope for is the appearance of
       more people like Elizabeth Warren, who want things to improve for
       the people of this country. If you and others who do see the
       reality will just keep telling us what we need to hear, then we,
       the people, will hopefully use our votes to kick the greed out of
       our nation's capitol.
       Recently, it seems that the comedy news has been lampooning other
       news programs as much as it has been disrespecting lousy
       politicians. This, too, is an important step: if anybody is really
       unsure of who they can trust, they must not be suffering very much,
       or listening very closely.
       We can't hope to win against the power of greed! We can only hope
       to make a small mark each day on the minds of those who share our
       right to vote.

       I wonder how Moyers can still defend his old boss LBJ who history
       now records was the most corrupt politician Washington and Texas
       ever had.
     * Randy Hyle
       Yeah, but he got things done! LBJ was an insider who knew how to
       play the game. He did favors, and called favors in. He wasn't
       afraid to do a little arm twisting, or even threats, to get the
       votes he needed to pass landmark legislation like the Civil Rights
       Act. Compared to the crooks in Washington today, he was a saint.

       Mr. Moyers posits the label, "mercantile class," but does not
       elaborate on its members. The most powerful element controlling
       Washington is the military industrial complex with Dick Cheney as
       its prime icon. It has feeble-ized the antiwar movement, bought
       every political entity with the spoils of no-bid contracts and is
       firmly in control. The hedge funds and investment banks are funding
       technologies that operate this complex and, in turn, receive their
       funding from the mega-corps that benefit from eternal war. Ike
       Eisenhower's warning dissipated like smoke in the winds of a time
       long forgotten by a society mesmerized by vapid media and Kim

       It's always easy to describe a problem, and Mr. Moyers waxes

       This is mass hypnosis at play in our society now. The movie
       "Network" was the lighthouse that tried to steer us clear of these
       deadly reefs of social mediocrity and tolerance for political
       mendacity- in 1976. Peter Finch as the Mad Hatter expounding on the
       hypocrisy of the times-being used by Robert Duvall's blackhearted
       corporate hatchet man. Finch, in a moment of his character's
       clarity, tells the unvarnished truth to the American people on live

       Marches on Washington aren't enough. Nothing - absolutely nothing -
       is going to change until we camp out Egyptian style and refuse to
       go away until it does. People in the US are either in a
       high-fructose-corn-syrup/GM coma or look to others as saviors - or
       wait for Christ to come on the clouds. Save yourselves. Why would

       Now that was as honest and as depressing as we all have been
       telling ourselves. It would seem the fix is in and the victims are
       us. A well planned and currently executed initiative by global
       power elite which has the audacity, in concert with
       government/corporate/defense, to dismantle and shred the very
       fabric upon which our patchwork quilt of a country and world is
       sewn together. Ownership through privitizing over the land, the sea
       and coastlines, the schools, the cities (urban shrinkage),the
       energy sources, etc. Even to the sorting mechanisms of measuring
       and testing to distraction our children's minds for the sorting of
       the value added for a global workforce. Each of these working at
       odds with the other for the unraveling and final redesign of those
       that believe they have the entitlement to own and control
       everything and most exclusively us. Technology is their weapon of
       choice and robotics have become more important then humans. But
       robots do not have humor, or heart, or sensitivity, or morals or
       ethics, because they represent the input of those that have no
       shame and you can not shame the shameless whether human or robot.
       Those that would think themselves our masters. But in the end could
       be the distruction of all we hold dear if we as lemmings do
       nothing....and then they came for me!
       Thank you Mr. Moyers. You speak the truth and the warning.

       Keep voting for Republicans and you keep getting less restrictions
       on
       the banks, on regulations that protect the American people, on
       campaign
       laws and politicians that think that the need to destroy all the
       regulations put in place by President Roosevelt. We have lost our
       pensions and our jobs and our savings and our benefits and it was
       VP
       George Bush senior who put in the tax incentives to ship jobs
       overseas.
       And all this lessening of regulations for corporate donations and
       campaign laws makes it harder for democrats to do their job even if
       they
       want to do the correct thing, they have to bow to their donors now.

       We are taught that Athens was the home of democracy, but few of us
       know that the Athenian democracy was very different from ours -
       their representatives were selected by lottery rather than by
       elections, and they considered elections to be anti-democratic and
       subject to the corrupting influences of money and dynastic
       families. It was called "The radical democracy" because of its
       inclusiveness, and it survived for hundreds of years.

       march and, yes, punch lobbyists and scream at them to get out of
       town will we even stand a chance to getting back what's been taken
       from us by the corporations. And, the sad thing is, the rich, even

       Yeah, I agree. I wasn't really commenting on any questions of

       these comment boards people will correct someone who mentions
       `Democracy' with the "Republic" comment, but then not fully
       describe, and clarify the U.S. as a Democratic Republic.
       I mean if they are going to take the time to say `It's a Republic,'
       why not add the precise phraseology? It baffles me!
       I even wonder if it's an attempt to linguistically connect the word
       "Republic," as in Republican, instead of "Democratic," as in
       Democrat.
       I'm sure it's not so deep, but after the famous talking point's

       Spot on, Bill. It bears repeating. It's not a partisan issue at all
       because both Dems and Reps are in the pockets of the wealthy whose
       checkbooks buy them access to the levers of power. Democratic
       activists (rightly) cry out about voter ID laws and such, but
       that's peanuts compared to the real voter disenfranchisement taking
       place as a matter of business as usual in DC when all of our
       representation is bought out from under us. Until that changes, not
       much else will. Ordinary folks like me despair at finding a
       solution in the face of massive entrenched opposition but we dream
       of a day when our government acts in the interests of the people
       before the demands of profit.

       I've always liked Bill Moyers' antiquated humanism. He's a
       genuinely nice guy with genuinely Christian motives. But the
       ordinary citizen who fights the policies that would benefit him
       materially are often misunderstood. The AHA, for instance, which
       would insure all of us has become anathema, although it will cost
       much less in the long run than the current broken system. But the
       Tea Party and the rest of the low-information crowd aren't voting
       their best economic interests. They're voting their morality.
       Progressive thoughts are evil. They must be fought. Material
       considerations are an epiphenomenon. They don't really count. Wars
       require sacrifices.

       So true. Deeply ingrained racism and bigotry is what ails the US
       more than anything else. It allows right wing criminal scum to find
       a population of easily manipulated voters to get their self serving
       agenda passed.
       The 50th anniversary of the march on Washington has many patting
       themselves on the back but the fact is, not much has really
       changed. The main change is that those causing this are far more
       calculating in the ways that they promote their racist and bigoted
       agenda.
       In the same period, many countries, especially in Europe, have put
       behind them these idiotic right wing policies and ideas that have
       stalled progress in the US and driven most of the country into

       This all so true and upsetting. But your point that it can't be

       broken. So why do we keep looking to the political process to fix
       all these terrible problems? If there is any hope of a
       transformative revolution that might tackle and overturn this
       corrupt system, it will have to grow and change the world outside
       of the little self-enclosed, self-referential and self-serving
       bubble of power that you describe so clearly and relentlessly with
       each broadcast. The way out is by incrementally building a

       Our political democracy is at risk because there is no economic
       democracy in our society. Without the means to be educated, to be
       employed with enough time away from work, to have the motivation to
       participate, the economic totalitarians will call the shots. The
       ownership economy has excluded many from the money and the power in
       this country, leaving it to those with the bare ambition, and greed
       to insinuate themselves and write the rules so that they may retain
       their power and money.
       To get beyond this, the rest of us have to fight back,
       economically. By forming our own cooperative enterprises to meet
       our social, economic, cultural needs. Our Credit Unions, our Food
       Co-ops, our worker owned businesses are the nucleus for a future
       economy where we can take market share away from our present
       corporate overlords. It is only when their status quo is in

       the evening news, along with commentary and all the protest march
       information . What we have now is a media that will ignore
       important events if they don't match the agenda set for them. There
       is no free press, not really. The only thing that would make up for
       that is social media, and a focused message which is what the

       Community charity only works on the symptoms. Community investment
       in itself can be directed to the actual ill. Empowerment of people.

       Occupy Wall St's idea of direct action is chaining oneself to a
       desk in a bank. Pishaw!
       Cooperative enterprise (Credit Unions, Food Co-ops, Consumer and
       Worker owned businesses) can take market share from this economic
       system that pays for the political system. Our investment in our
       own communities is only a start on the road to refusing to keep the
       status quo.

       I don't know where this list originates from, but as something
       specific that citizens could fight for, is this list something we
       should be fighting for now? Is this a fantasy? Can these things
       happen now? Who would lead this charge? So many citizens are just
       struggling to keep their homes -
       1. No Tenure / No Pension. A Congressman collects a salary while in
       office and receives no pay when they are out of office.
       2. Congress (past, present & future) participates in Social
       Security. All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to
       the
       Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the
       Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American
       people. It may not be used for any other purpose.
       3. Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, just as all
       Americans do.
       4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise.
       Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%.
       5. Congress loses their current health care system and participates
       in the same health care system as the American people.
       6. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the
       American people.
       7. All contracts with past and present Congressmen are void
       effective
       1/1/15. The American people did not make this contract with
       Congressmen. Congressmen made all these contracts for themselves.
       Serving in Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding Fathers
       envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term‚s
       [sic],
       then go home and back to work.

       Independent studies also have noted that unemployment and wages for
       the 98% have been stagnant or dropping for the last decade, hitting
       the crisis point in 2007-2008. As corporations take advantage of
       the Great Recession to turn well-paying jobs here into part-time or
       lower-paying jobs, and also to send more jobs overseas, it is no
       surprise that there are more Americans needing SNAP. Walmart comes
       to mind, as they've built government help into their business
       model.

       While of course it's used as a dirty name we really need to look to
       the existing successful models of socialism, scandinavian style,
       for some answers.
       We have socialism now, of course, we just avoid calling it that,
       but there is the answer.
       If big business does not wish to be socially responsible then they
       aren't allowed to play the game. Greed is the enemy, and whatever
       kindness and responsibility still resides in those thugs needs to
       be tapped into.

       We all knew this when we voted for President Obama years ago. BUT
       we were unrealistic to think even one man leading could do it all.
       CHANGE, MUST COME FROM ALL OF US; AND the Congress and Senate.
       Everyone should take personal responsibility to make changes in our
       choices. It is not enough to complain.
       Do what you can to write representatives, use solar power, stop
       gassing up buy electric, use alternative means of power, turn off
       TV cable. It is brainwashing you to think "their" way. And vote!

       The game is already over. The only question is when do 99% attempt
       to do something seriously.
       Accroding to Mr. Hodges (truthdig,com) the history shows a feeble
       attempt is followed a real hard one 10 yrs later. This makes 2019
       to be the year after Occupy Wall Street movement peetered out.
       USA oligarchs are doing exactly what Britisher did to India. Keep
       the young & restless busy with "education" to get the coveted
       "Civil Servant Job". Once you have kids it is diffcult to partake
       in any movement against the establishment.
       The US education at HS level is mostly useless and many can't even
       write a proper sentence upon graduation. They are selectively
       infested with drugs dealers. Try asking HS principal that you are
       willing to pay $100 for every drug dealing student (not user) and
       you will be deined. College level is done in a way so majority
       takes a more than 4 yrs to graduate. By the time you graduate, you
       are 23-25 yr range when you may end up starting a family or
       obligated with loans on college education, house, car. Minimum wage
       jobs for college graduates and raised with classic American middle
       class values forces us into thinking that work hard first to PAY
       off DEBT. Thus keeping the young and majority of revolutionaries
       off balance.
       We continue to think in a lawful intervention. One MUST come to a
       conclusion that the change to the system which is rigged against
       you needs different ways to organize. They must be self
       propagating, small groups to attack the CANCER. Olden ways of
       organizing movement will simply not work. They will be infilterated
       very easily and made to fight with each other very easily.

       The growth of the middle class and prosperity expanded greatly from
       the end of WWII - big investment in education for vets and loans
       for housing - right up to the 1970's.
       The repeal of trust busting legislation and repeal of controls over
       financial institutions, trading stocks, deregulation of
       communications and utilities, has led to the totalitarian fascism
       we find ourselves in. Teddy Roosevelt gave us trust busting
       (breaking up the kind of monopolies we have again today) and from
       Reagan era onward, that has been undone and harmed the 98% while
       enriching very fewl
       "One of his first notable acts as president was to deliver a
       20,000-word address to Congress[62] asking it to curb the power of
       large corporations (called "trusts"). For his aggressive attacks on
       trusts over his two terms, he has been called a "trust-buster."
       In the 1904 presidential election, Roosevelt won the presidency in
       his own right in a landslide victory. His vice president was
       Charles Fairbanks.
       Roosevelt also dealt with union workers. In May 1902, United Mine
       Workers went on strike to get higher pay wages and shorter
       workdays. He set up a fact-finding commission that stopped the
       strike, and resulted in the workers getting more pay for fewer
       hours." he also expanded food inspection and health policiesl.

       health and well-being of the land, crops, water, conservatism,
       health and basic needs that uplift many and curb monopolies and

       country to prosper - we need to follow Teddy's lead again.

       Mr. Moyers blames present day Washington for this mess - but it all
       started in Philadelphia. When a few oligarchs in those colonies
       decided to rebel against those unjust British taxes the majority of
       the people living in those colonies (estimates range from 3 to 4
       million) had no `right' to say anything, to vote for the candidates
       (who wrote the Declaration of Independence), or even the First
       Constitutional Convention. These `great' United States did not
       start out as a Democracy ... and it never was (and this way it
       never will be). From an oligarchy to plutocracy, that's how far
       we've come.
       Ask some economists (or mathematicians): If everybody would put in
       `real' work to produce what this country (or the whole world) needs
       regarding food, clothing and shelter how many hours per week would
       we all have to work? In my humble estimation maybe 10-15 hours per
       person per week. The difference right now goes to pay for
       bureaucrats, bankers, brokers and other assorted `free-loaders'
       (lawyers) who are living off the back of the rest of the real
       workers who do the production today. (Talking about lawyers: Our
       population of 300 million + does really need close to the same
       number of laws we have?)
       Just a few observations ...

       One of the trademarks of fascism is when corporations rule the

       Thank you Bill Moyers for all you do to shine light on our
       government. As you mentioned, the mainstream news media is
       complicit in this scheme. It superficially reports on day to day
       tactics without any deeper analysis of the why. I am afraid for
       this country and what I see as the inevitable conclusion to this
       slow motion train wreck that is unfolding before our eyes.
       What the greedy corporatists and their political minions in the
       government refuse to recognize is that there comes a tipping point
       when the people will rise up and take control. It could be in 5
       years, a decade or two but it is coming. Declining wealth and
       standards of living for the working people will reach the breaking
       point and then the American Spring will happen. Look to what is
       happening in Syria and Egypt to see the future of America.

       Most disturbing is how peaceful the takeover has been. Few seem to

       movement was the single most brilliant and efficacious move on the
       part of the democracy marauders. No force to articulate and

       That is the point. Vote for who? The republicans and democrats are
       two sides of the same coin. There is no real democracy or choice
       for voters unless a 3rd party candidate gets elected. The vast
       electorate isn't even aware of what is going on.
     * Urbi et Orbi
       Bribes are old fashioned. No one takes them any more. Instead
       influence is bought through legal channels. Everyone in congress
       serves on "committees" like the finance committee. They are wined
       and dined by lobbyists, money is donated to their campaign fund by
       the big banks and financial institutions and in return favorable
       legislation is passed. When they retire, they become highly paid
       lobbyists or get a big fat job working for the very companies that
       bought them off. It is a revolving door.

       remembering our individual strength can be multiplied by acting

       I appreciate your continued positive take on the current situation.
       I do not like to fight a losing battle.
       The US president is a "Figure Head". Clinton, Obama, Bush are all
       spun from the same fiber. Corrupt to the core but have enough
       charisma to fool the public. The public has stopped thinking and
       almost on all counts is silent. Speaking out has consequences in
       USA just like Russia or E. Germany.
       You are still thinking of working the system. The System needs
       dismantling. We need somebody like Jesse Ventura. The most critical
       4th leg of democracy is the Press. We have very few journalist left
       to call it a press. The media is controlled and it is
       entertainment. FOX, MSNBC, CBS, NBC, ABC, radio, newspapers oh my
       what a sham.
       The more educated & polished a political candidate, the more inept
       he or she is. I voted for Obama and now feel like a fool. Naomi
       Wolf's book is a must read for all Americans. She lays out 10 steps
       process for a dictatorial form of govt deployment which has been
       followed to a tee in the history. We are already there. In my
       opinion, those who do not see this, are good people who believe
       that people in power will retreat to moral and ethical values they
       are raised with. But it has been proven over and over again, give
       any man (or woman ) power, the transformation to undesirable state
       of mind happens with in days! Power must be distributed, which it
       was in our presidential form of government with 3 branches +
       1(press). But when 2 of any 4 get in bed the game starts
       degenerating. When 3 out 4 come together, it is beyond fixing. And
       When 4 out 4 are in bed with each other, you have open form of
       autocracy. We are at 3.8/4.0 scale.
       Still have a lot of fight left. But writing like this, I am now on
       "track list".
       Are there any politicians I like? Yes, I do. The likes of Sen.
       Elizabeth Warren, Gov. Jesse Ventura & Sen Sanders come to mind
       immediately.
       It is a sad day as USA was the only BEACON of hope for people. And
       that hope was because of the middle class VALUES ( not
       economically). What a country full of philanthropic people and
       great modesty with absolutely no parallel in the history of
       mankind, for a nation, many times over powerful than rest of the
       world combined. USA was dismantled in a matter of last 3 decades
       starting with handful people. Carter was the last good president
       Sad saga for the rest of the human race. That's how important was
       the middle class of America. It is destroyed in front of my eyes.

       republic, join MOVE TO AMEND.
       Move to Amend is dedicated to amending the U.S. Constitution so
       that it clearly and unequivocally says that: 1) rights recognized
       under the Constitution belong to human being, only, and not to
       artificial entities like corporations and labor unions; and, 2)
       that money is not speech and, thus, political spending can be
       limited.
       Move to Amend's WE THE PEOPLE AMENDMENT, which you can read at
       [63]http://www.wethepeopleamendment.org, is the ONLY proposed
       Constitutional amendment currently pending before Congress that
       says the two things that need to be said - "Corporations are NOT
       People!" and "Money is NOT Speech."
       Passing and ratifying THAT amendment (and not one of the other

       are going to be able to re-claim the political power that the

       elected officials who refuse to do the job and opt to obstruct any

       I think that someone could get elected president running with that
       list as a platform. What politician would publicly be against one
       thing on the list. If those were the only things acted on in the
       presidency, our country would be changed in a positive way, and
       affect long term future results.
       It's no crazier than some of the other nut jobs that have recently
       run for that office. We should do the basic fixes first.
       Economically things are going to get worse for our citizens in the
       coming few years. This will make for a scarey election next time
       around. We are actually becoming a country where people do not
       believe they can have an effect on the government. I think the list
       just needs a voice.

       I have been listening to Bill Moyers for a long time now. He has an
       indepth social conscience that has inspired me and maintains my
       hope for humanity. There are intelligent people who have a social
       awareness and thoughtful, insight into how things are and how
       things should be. He always brings to my mind the words of RFK,
       "Others look at the way things are in the world and ask why? I look
       at how things in the world could be and ask, Why not?"
       Like every gilded age, those in power today will succumb to the
       future. How the future looks back at us is up to us. Those who have
       the responsibility to carry out the needs of the masses better keep
       in mind that ultimately they will answer to the people they serve.
       Money comes and money goes but the people will always be there.

       In North Carolina democracy is gone already. The legislature is

       Dismantling of Public Education, repeal of environmental standards,
       and attacks on voting rights all according to ALEC playbook.
       Privatization of infrastructure is also in progress, with the
       method of blatant theft of municipal assets key to maximizing
       profit. They have commandeered Asheville's water system and 22,000
       acre watershed, Asheville's airport and Charlotte International
       Airport---All with NO compensation to the cities that built these
       assets. (Lawsuits pending) There is no respect for State or US
       Constitutions, they just do whatever they want, legal or not. This
       is the future of our entire country, unfortunately started here.

       Thank you, once again, Bill Moyers. It is so tragic to see,
       especially now, how little voice we really do have. As the
       environment degrades and urgent action is needed to preserve any
       quality of life for the future, we have items like the "Monsanto
       Protection Act"........they feel so powerful now that they don't
       even need to make an effort to be transparent.
       And as we prepare to pay for yet another war in the Middle East
       (Syria), even as Iraq and Afghanistan bankrupted this
       country...........it matters not at all that most Americans
       (estimated 60%) do not want us to become involved.

       The US has by design never been a democracy. The aristocrat beauty
       pageant every two years is just to fool the rubes -- belief in the
       rightness of the aristocratic system is necessary to even enter
       that pageant.
     * Anonymous
       Representative democracy is neither representative nor democratic.
       Emma Goldman was right: if voting in aristocrat beauty pageants
       changed anything, it would be illegal. Audre Lorde was right too
       (pace Einstein): the master's tools will not tear down the master's
       house.
       The rot, unfortunately, is systemic, and lies in the incompatible
       incentives between the ruling class (and you bet there is one) and
       the citizenry. By voting for the winner you have simply thrown away
       any and all recourse you have ever had against them. You have
       elevated them to Mt. Olympus and freed them to act against your
       interests with nothing more than an ignored and incoherent prayer.
       Without the ability for a supermajority of voters in a district,
       perhaps 3/4, to summarily and immediately strip bad actors of their
       office and worry about a replacement later, what you've got is not
       democracy.

       Better to not vote at all. 50% turnout is worrisome, but 20%
       turnout in an on-year would provide strong evidence to other
       countries that the US is a failed nation with an all-too-successful
       state, and perhaps inform their response when the USG barges in
       somewhere and makes demands.
       It's a bit late to do anything about the USG destroying the
       evidence of its false flag CW op in Syria, unfortunately, but
       always remember: power does not exist without obedience, and the
       powerful need you more than you need them.

       "Outraged citizens will descend on this town and tear it apart with
       their own hands" Looks rather violent. Lenin's answer to the same
       question in 1909 didn't turn out very well. Can you, or Mark
       Leibovitch, offer a more specific promising, effective, and
       zero-violence but necessary and lasting revolution? We need just
       this. Urgently. Thanks.

       In
       social psychology there is a phenomenon known as the "fundamental
       misattribution error": roughly,
       when attempting to formulate an explanation for another person's
       anomalous behavior, to overemphasize the role of character and
       identity,
       and underemphasize or ignore the forces operating in the situation.
       It turns out that highly individualized cultures, such as the
       American mainstream, are much more prone to the error, which can be
       seen, for example, in their haste to blame the
       victim. This error also forms the basis of partisan politics and
       their simple, inconsistent, often situational narratives.
       The system itself is working exactly as designed: to keep citizens
       *away* from making policy, lest they tyrannize the only minority
       the Founders were concerned about, the landed gentry as a class
       above. If you think this is a problem, perhaps one ought to divert
       one's allegiance from the immortal king/parchment idol that
       empowers that aristocracy against you.

       Where do we turn for protection? To each other. The lack of class
       solidarity, artfully thwarted by the effects of political
       partisanship, consumer culture, "hustling culture" and identity
       politics, is a problem, to be sure. Solidarity is power, as can
       easily be seen in the breach: police interviewing co-suspects
       separately, the taboo against talking about compensation at work,
       the wolf splitting the weak animal off the herd, and in so many
       other places in nature and human culture I'm surprised the
       self-appointed masters were able to disappear it so cleanly. Yet
       people are a bit too happy to fight in pitched battle against each
       other, against their "other" of bad character or immorality or
       cooties or whatever, while those in the skybox snort your ticket

       Why do you think asking the aristocrats ever more nicely and
       submissively is going to get any better results than it has?
       Without force there is no power. Of course it doesn't have to be
       violent force -- there's a reason why general strikes are illegal
       and often answered with state violence, and that reason is because
       they are effective at denying the powerful the things they want.
       Business as usual requires the coordination and submission of
       untold millions of people. If enough people deny the business
       masters that submission and hold fast to the line, they'll either
       crawl to you begging or they'll start a war with you, neither of
       which looks good for *them*. It did work for Gandhi.

       No, not really. See marxmarv, above. Nonviolence worked in South
       Africa and India, but would probably not have worked against
       Hitler. It may be the only choice for us now, though, since Bill
       says that drones are being purchased by oil companies to protect
       their unholy pipelines. Nonviolence does not mean that no violence
       occurs, only that the violence which occurs is waged against the
       people by the tyrants. We need a new plan of action that stays
       nonviolent but captures power for the people once and for all, and
       makes urgently needed changes in governance.

       Bill Moyers is one of the only truly honorable, brilliant, and

       sure the US did not invest in solar so they could continue to choke
       every last bleeding cent out of us. China took advantage of that
       and sank billions into developing solar. By any rational

       can't make it in the free market or won't take the risk to try. DO
       THE MATH WITH SOLAR, it doesn't work. My neighbor put that stupid
       stuff on his roof, then his roof leaked, the panels get dirty and
       don't perform as well, they degrade each year and you get less out
       of them in the end you pay just as much for solar as you do to the
       electric company and if we didn't have to spend extra for
       electricity for the solar credits and if we'd let people freely
       compete to produce cheap oil and nukes (like France) solar would
       never pay for itself. The production went to China because it is
       cheaper to produce there and the producers hope to sell it there
       and China won't allow open free markets so companies do what they
       have to do for the cheap slave labor. You're living in a complete

       When an angry mob gathers outside, it would tend to bring anyone to
       a state of being more focused on what they are demanding. It must
       be anger that is peacefully and lawfully expressed - and the hard
       part is having the message be clear and focused. (We saw some of
       those problems in the one percent movement - not an easy task). The
       issues of fairness and corruption in the goverment are not partisan
       issues for the most part.
       The marchers during the civil rights movement were some of the
       bravest and most disciplined people ever, and were truly inspiring
       in expressions of their anger and dissatisfaction, and they were
       organized to an amazing degree. - but yes there were/are fine
       lines, and it does sometimes cost lives.
       Most of these people in power (politicians and the wealthy) are
       extremely out of touch with " we the people". We do need to be
       idealistic about our democracy because it will never be perfect. If
       you shoot for less than perfect, then it gets really bad. I am
       tired of people acting all relaxed and saying things like "at least
       it's not as bad as Mogadishu". (I've heard it a lot, especially
       when I start to get "passionate" on a subject.

       expresses it so well. He is as far from violent as it gets, and he
       is much appreciated by this listener.

       interview, which never really comes full circle for many of the
       same reasons both of these talking heads wax on and on about. As a
       reporter, I'm hard pressed to find any examples of where Mr.
       Leibovich has taken a "courageous" stand to hold any of the players
       he now lambastes accountable in his day-to-day reporting, where it
       counts-rather than saving it all to sell a book. As for Mr. Moyers,
       while he now disparages BP for the way the lobbied themselves
       through the oil spill but had no problems taking oil company money
       when it came to sponsoring his early programs. Both fail to take
       any responsibilities for the mess they have had a hand in creating.
       When are we going to find some people with relatively clean hands
       to REALLY explore and then address what's going on (and not) in
       Washington?

       No Maggie, we don't. It is illegal to fund abortions with tax
       money. Planned Parenthood has been very careful to separate funding
       for other women's health issues and contraception from abortions.
       They have survived many audits of their books, most of them
       prompted by conservatives, and they are correctly handling funds.
       If you think that contraception is the same as abortion, that's a
       separate discussion.
       But the "We're funding abortions with tax money" argument is either
       a lie or ignorance. So, are you lying or ignorant?

       From an occasional visitor's view it is apparent that Washington
       and its outlying environs are doing very well, and that it's
       because all the government employees and others attached to it can
       still afford plenty of goods and services. While the rest of the
       country has struggled with incredible hardships due to the decline
       of the housing market and rampant unemployment, the D.C. Metro area
       has been able to keep the very high standard of living it has
       become accustomed to. Construction continued unabated and
       McMansions rose in outlying suburbs as if there were no economic
       crisis. There are no boarded up businesses or homes in these areas
       and high end luxury cars are common in mall and shopping center
       parking lots. No wonder people in the rest of the country are
       resentful - we would love to have the same kind of cash cow the
       D.C. Metro area is privy to.

       ... to OWS folks "Direct Action" means chaining oneself to a desk
       in some powerbrokers office. Pishaw! Ok, it does capture some
       attention, just a half pishaw then.
       Our rallying cry ought to be "Market Share!" Yes, take away some of
       that from these corporate overlords and we'll surely have their
       attention. The way to do that is with cooperative enterprise,
       businesses that are owned by consumers and workers. The Mutual
       Insurance Companies, the Credit Unions, the Food Co-ops, the worker
       Co-ops are the nucleus around which we can build a new economy that
       is less dependent upon those at the top
       We must however be active in the governance of these cooperative
       enterprise or they can run off the rails into the same kinds of
       malfeasance we see in DC. We can start by self educating ourselves
       and participating in the growth of new enterprises and the
       expansion of existing ones. You want to get the attention of those
       economic totalitarianists? Then hit them in their pockebooks and
       take some market share away from them.
     * DavidW
       Cooperative enterprise on a parallel track to build an economy
       based on local ownership by consumers and workers to take market
       share away. Oh, there's been re-distribution of wealth alright, our
       money going to the rich in the form of "royalties" and the like. We
       can slow it or stop it by opening our eyes to the possibilities of
       what Credit Unions, Mutual Insurance companies, Food Co-ops and
       Worker owned Co-ops can do to keep our wealth in our communities.
     * DavidW
       Let's try economic power to force change by taking market share
       away to reduce the economic influence upon our political democracy.
       Cooperative enterprise can do what protests or violent revolution
       can't, preserve life and property while changing the status quo.
       Invest and shop in your local Food Co-ops, bank and save at your
       local Credit Unions, work at your mutual insurance companies,
       support your local worker owned cooperative businesses. This option
       will allow us to deny big business revenue and working capital to
       influence our political democracy.
     * DavidW
       Cooperative enterprise happens when communities rally to mutually
       support their own economic, social, cultural and potentially their
       political needs. It's a viable option in the form of Credit Unions,
       Food Co-ops, Mutually owned Insurance companies, and worker owned
       Cooperatives. Grow and expand this business sector that is governed
       by the people they serve (still gotta participate lest they run off
       the rails as well) and the corporate overlords will start to worry
       why their market share is shrinking. Take away their revenue and
       working capital and we can moderate their influence on the
       political democracy in this country.
       Cooperative enterprise is a way to help us build economic
       democracy, to bring that ownership culture to the people so that
       they can buy-in and invest their money in their own communities.

       Most of those gov. employees you blame have fixed salaries that are
       way below the salaries of corporate lobbyists, contractors,
       military procurers, and the vast networks of privatizers and
       corporations; or as you so loosely call them "others".
       When we start identifying those truly responsible for our state of

       the only entity powerful enough to rein in the special interests is
       the very government you blame. It's who we place in charge of
       government, that are to blame. History is replete with examples
       that by placing responsible people in charge of gov. we can solve

       "Or perhaps they do not tell us these things because they fear that
       if the system were exposed for what it is, outraged citizens would
       descend on this town, and tear it apart with their bare hands."
       There is something remarkable in these comments. I've watched this
       segment 3 times now and continue to come back to it again and
       again. I've listened to Bill Moyers offer controversial rhetoric in
       the past, somehow this seems different. A baptists minister
       presenting words this volatile, this inciting, it would seem a
       paradigm shift has occurred in the undercurrent of the nation's
       sentiments and in the disposition those who would speak to them.
       Indeed we are living in remarkable, perhaps bizarre, times. A city
       that use to represent the breadbasket of middle America declares
       the nation's largest bankruptcy. A former veteran and Vietnam war
       protester, and someone who's won the Nobel Prize for Peace are the
       2 leading voices beating the drums for war against the will of its
       own people its allies and against the will of the world at large.
       And one of main perpetrators that almost single-handedly crashed
       world economy is poised to become the Chairman of Federal Reserve
       Bank. Amazingly, President Carter has even said: "America no longer
       has a functioning Democracy".
       And this is the short list. Those even casually paying attention
       should have their jaws perpetually on the floor. Something is
       dramatically different, dramatically askew as we seem to have
       crossed some kind of Rubicon of no return. If these events haven't
       affected you on a profoundly deep level you either live in cave or
       need to check your pulse. A liberal man of peace of Moyers' stature
       heralding the day when its citizens rise up, storm the nation's
       capitol and rip to to shreds, surely this denotes some kind of
       watermark that has not been seen before.

       I think you see a cash register and guile-laden quid pro quo. I see
       a gift economy within a close-knit community. The pressures holding
       the aristocracy in their place are more than just financial. The
       consequences are more along the lines of "access", which is what
       happens when hard-skills technocrats get replaced by soft-skills
       meritocrats who define merit as whatever they happen to have done.
       Not writing that check until your requested legislation passes
       becomes the far more deniable neglected invitation to the
       "important" cocktail parties.
       There's an entire culture of proles as Eloi to which we, those
       paying for it, need to say no.

       A quid pro quo with whom, the elites? I would think that, yes a
       spontaneous denial to submit by 10% of the US population will
       happen with in my lifetime. Not going to happen.
       The people need alternatives that can capture their imaginations
       and offer real options to the current "royalty payments." There is
       also a realization that what I suggest may fail to build enough
       momentum and mass that can lead to change. But, I've got to try
       since I believe that for us to reach a point to basically not take
       it anymore as a group, we'd have to be in a really bad place and
       for all the complex pieces to come together for that to happen may
       take too long for me to leave it all up to chance.
       I think the more direct action of accumulating community wealth and
       power is a fraction of a step more effective than what OWS thinks
       is "direct action" and handcuffing oneself to a desk. In a bank.
       Is my thinking utopian, in a sense yes in a practical way. As I've
       written before, I want to fight fire with fire. Cooperative
       enterprise can give me access to that garden hose, and I hope to
       inspire others to bring their plastic beach buckets to help and I
       hope someone brings matches.

       Been asleep for a few decades? The impoverishment of America has
       been ongoing since the 1980s, moving the nation's collective wealth
       from the bottom up. We've been living in an almost surreal rerun of
       the years leading up to the Great Depression. Ordinary Americans,
       the poor and middle class, have been so deeply divided and pitted
       against each other that it isn't possible to push back. To update
       the old protest chant: "The people, divided, will surely be
       defeated."

       The race thing is so 1960s. The issue today is class -- middle
       class against the poor. The majority of our poor are women, and the
       majority of these are white. Nevertheless, the rich couldn't care
       less about the color of those they can exploit, and the middle
       class is glad to scapegoat the poor of all races equally.
     * Anonymous
       You exaggerate. Let me explain why I say this (it is not intended
       as an insult.) Think back to Occupy. What began as a historic
       people's movement that had the potential to change the course we're
       on was quickly redefined (often by media marketed to liberals) as a
       Middle Class Only movement. So the rest of us, the former-middle
       class/poor, walked away, and Occupy died. The word itself is merely
       a marketing term today. The poor are keenly aware of the degree to
       which middle classers support democracy -- but only for the middle
       class. That said, regarding your comment about a "man of peace:"
       Don't confuse peace with passivity. Jesus was so outraged by the
       greed and hypocrisy he saw in the temple that he trashed it. (John
       12:13)

       No. We've been in this situation before. In the past, each time the
       richest few took control over the country, the "masses" -- the poor
       and middle class -- united to successfully push back., to
       everyone's benefit. This time, we were pitted against each other,
       so we can't push back. Would you really expect the poor to "stand
       in solidarity" to protect the privileges of a middle class that
       decided that jobless are undeserving of basic food and shelter?
     * Anonymous
       I believe he has. Mr.Moyer's role is to provide information/ask
       questions that prompts constructive, adult discussions.) On the
       issue of 9/11, the bottom line is that there are currently a number
       of experts with the absolute truth that utterly contradict each
       other. We've hashed the old "fell into its own footprint" half to
       death, but the bottom line remains that the public doesn't have
       adequate information to know for certain. I'm personally amazed
       that so few have discussed the long, personal friendship of the bin
       Ladens and the Bush family. We can state our opinions, but it
       changes nothing.

       Yeah, the poor figured that one out years ago.

       We've tried for years, but very few have the public microphone.
       When it comes to American outrage, you have to keep in mind that
       what the rich are doing to the middle class, the middle class
       already did to the poor -- often with the same talking points
       (insults). No sympathy for the middle class -- those who chose the
       politics and policies that brought us to this point.

       To get a job in news broadcasting, of course the person is required
       to stick with the general script provided, and take care that what
       they report/how they report it meets the approval of station
       management. When it comes to journalism, if you want the job, you
       have to play by the boss's rules. Media marketed to liberals has a
       different problem: The issues they choose to cover, and the
       information that is included/excluded from reports, is determined
       on the basis of the interests of the focus group (i.e., middle
       class consumers). That's why those in liberal media, for example,
       have chosen not to report about how extreme our poverty crisis is
       growing. This issue does not interest middle class consumers.

       Yes, it is my understanding that while there was always a
       significant amount of poverty in DC, this generation of elitists
       drove them out like rats. If we don't see poverty, then it doesn't
       exist.

       The issue that accompanies the money game is the stunning ignorance
       (much of it, by choice, most of it due to laziness) of so many
       voters. Why do they vote at all when they are utterly clueless
       about the issues?
     * Anonymous
       On the other hand, while Americans shrug off the $700 billion, they
       will go into an outrage if they see a poor person purchase a little
       treat with food stamps. This generation can't have a revolution
       because govt won't let them buy a permit to revolt (they're a very
       obedient lot). It's actually much more complicated, but it comes
       down to the fact that we're far too deeply divided (by class)
       today. The middle class wants the poor to get on the front lines of
       a revolt to protect the privileges of the middle class.

       I'd love to see the "fell into its own footprint" concern hashed to
       death, but that hasn't been my experience. Posts denying controlled
       demolition of the three buildings in the World Trade Center usually
       stay far away from discussions of symmetrical collapse, buildings
       falling into their own footprints, and free fall...because the
       world has seen all those things on videos from that day making them
       very hard to deny. The three World Trade Center buildings were not
       destroyed by two plane crashes and localized fires. That is a fact,
       not opinion. Recent polls suggest that nearly 50% of the public
       does realizes that the government's story about what happened that
       day is incorrect. By speaking out about this miscarriage of justice
       we can change public perceptions and bring out the truth.

       Thank you for your reply. I do not agree that Occupy became a
       marketing ploy. Do not agree that violence is a legitimate vehicle
       for social change. Do not agree that the poor believe Middle
       America is only concerned about itself. Do not agree that I was
       exaggerating.
       The OWS movement has strengths and weaknesses. One of its sore
       points was that there were no official spokesmen, and broad social
       changes need to have its leaders. However this is also one of its
       strengths. OWS is an example of pure, distributed progressive
       values. Leadership can be coerced or co-opted, but you can't kill
       ideas. Those in the OWS movement haven't stopped working for social
       advancement. And neither has leaderless groups like Anonymous or
       the Arab Spring which are simultaneously everywhere and nowhere.
       The greatest efforts of social change in the 20th century were,
       like OWS, pacifist and non-violent. Gandhi took on the world's
       greatest power by himself without resorting to violence and won.
       MLK achieved dramatic accomplishments with peaceful, civil
       resistance. Violence has always been the implement of the
       oppressor, resorting to violence delegitimizes your movement.
       According to recent census data, most Americans are at or near
       poverty conditions. It is not accurate to suggest that that there
       is some profound ideological division between the abject poor and
       those who are at or near poverty levels. The problem in American
       society is economic disparity between the 99% and the 1%.
       And I don't agree that Moyers' words do not represent a paradigm
       shift in the sentiments of the American people or commentators like
       Moyers who speak to them. We are living in dramatic times with
       dramatic changes that are already upon us. Obviously these words
       are being used euphemistically to convey the seriousness of the
       moment. I doubt seriously armed insurrection and government
       overthrow is being advocated.

       it appears that American's suck at history because we have learned
       nothing from it.
     * Tarik Dean
       Let's also not forget the fact that history shows that the US is
       not above false flag operations and Operation Northwoods is a
       perfect example of that. Even the own words of the POTUS at that
       time help to provide some insight. Bush himself stated that "what
       we need is another Pearl Harbour", well it's common knowledge that
       FDR moved the Pacific Fleet out to Pearl to bait the Japanese into
       attacking so the US could enter the war.
     * Michael Glinsky
       Perhaps he's not ready to become a martyr to the cause of TRUTH.
       Certain people can be silenced by marginalizing and making them
       look like fanatics or lunatics, Others can be silenced by revealing
       or threatening to reveal seedy aspects of their personal lives.
       Still others can be pitted against the IRS or other arms of the
       government thus diverting their energies away from spreading the
       TRUTH. My guess is that none of these approaches would work on
       someone as highly regarded and as morally grounded as Bill. So the
       only avenue left would be the tried and true method of fabricating
       a
       fatal accident , or a previously unknown heart condition( subject
       found on a park bench) or the more expedient method of a lone
       gunman. My guess is Bill feels he can do more good staying in the
       game than becoming a martyr at this point.
