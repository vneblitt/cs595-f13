   Bradley Beach, August 30, 2013. (Transcript Below)
   Reporter: The recovery has been amazing. I mean even getting those
   boardwalks back up in time for Memorial Day...
   Governor Christie: 22 of 23 boardwalks by Memorial Day is a pretty
   amazing feat and it was a combination of the money we got from the
   federal government, but mostly the efforts of the local governments in
   conjunction with the state government to get the work done, get the
   permitting done and everything else. And a lot of good people from the
   private sector who came here and worked really hard to get this work
   done all through the winter and into what was a really lousy spring as
   we remember. And an awful June for that matter. So we haven't had the
   benefit of a lot of weather help this summer either, but August has
   been pretty good and this weekend's going to be great. So, I'll be down
   here and I hope everyone else comes too.
