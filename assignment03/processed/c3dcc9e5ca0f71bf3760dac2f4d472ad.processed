The Selling of Walmart How the world's biggest retailer won over D.C. without
a fight

   Walmart, so far, has no stores in the District. But Steven Restivo, the
   company's national director of community affairs, knows the area
   well--he's visited multiple times to open locations around the Beltway.
   And over the years, he's quietly moved the retailer into position for
   an eventual assault on the city itself.

   No other retailer requires an urban market-entry strategy, after all.
   In other metro areas, the behemoth's arrival has involved protracted,
   acrimonious fights with labor unions, community activists, and local
   politicians. Past experience has taught the firm that introductions, in
   particular, need to be handled carefully. So last fall, as executives
   let D.C. councilmembers in on their plan to open four stores in the
   District, Restivo had taken care to make sure the story went public on
   Walmart's own timetable--and according to its own script.

   What Restivo hadn't figured on, though, were the excited councilmembers
   who broke the news themselves.

   "Big box retailer coming to Ward 7? Stay tuned!" tweeted Ward 7's
   Yvette Alexander, around 11 p.m on Nov. 16.

   "Walmart's coming to D.C.," followed Ward 6's Tommy Wells, who let slip
   some details about the company's plans to pay "average" wages at "new
   urban model" stores.

   Restivo was on his way to Chicago as the news broke. When he saw the
   politicians doing his job for him, he turned right around, pushing the
   start button on a pre-planned marketing rollout. Two days later, a
   press release announced the plans, accompanied by a poll showing
   widespread support for Walmart. A [82]slick new website invited
   residents to sign a petition in favor of "more money for the city,
   support for local community organizations, fresh produce, job
   opportunities, affordable prescription drugs and investment in local
   businesses."

   The ambush approach made sense: Instead of a slow reveal that would
   give opponents time to gain traction, Walmart had asked landlords and
   developers to keep quiet until their sites were locked in, making the
   developments seem inevitable. Walmart had already seeded the ground
   with years of charitable giving. Now, with four actual stores to talk
   about, the image campaign kicked into high gear, complete with press
   events touting donations bigger than many local non-profits had ever
   seen.

   Six months later, with the four sites cruising toward approval, you
   might conclude that Walmart's strategy had won the day. And you
   wouldn't be wrong, exactly. But in other cities where the retailer used
   the same aggressive and determined campaign, like New York, Chicago,
   Los Angeles, and Philadelphia, opponents put up vastly bigger fights
   than in the District: [83]New York City councilmembers held
   anti-Walmart rallies; [84]Chicago's construction unions won increased
   wages for members building the stores.

   D.C.'s pols, though, treated anti-Walmart activism more like an
   annoying distraction than an opportunity to score populist points.
   Other than occasional demands that the corporation pay a "living
   wage"--$4 per hour above what the law requires--elected officials have
   mainly reassured constituents, celebrated the 1,200 jobs Walmart
   promises, and praised the retailer's apparent willingness to fund
   priorities that the District's strapped budget can't cover.

   The most sophisticated retail entrepreneur in the world brought its
   A-game to D.C. It probably didn't need it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   November's announcement of a plan for four Walmarts was a long time
   coming.

   Back in 2002, the company's real estate guy also wanted four stores in
   the District, including one at the old Convention Center. The city,
   though, was shooting for something better. "He was laser-focused on the
   CityCenter site downtown," recalls Michael Stevens, then in charge of
   the [85]Washington, DC Economic Partnership, which is charged with
   attracting business to D.C. "I advised him repeatedly that that was not
   going to happen."

   The next bid involved a site near the Rhode Island Avenue Metrorail
   station. But Walmart gave it a pass, telling then-Mayor Anthony
   Williams that there wasn't enough parking, and crime was too high.
   After that, [86]Walmart made noises about Poplar Point in Anacostia,
   and kept meeting with the city's economic development people, but made
   no commitments.

   In the meantime, D.C. started to prove itself as a retail market. A new
   Target thrived in Columbia Heights. Walmart began pondering ways to fit
   its typical big-box format into a city-sized shoebox. The chain's
   exurban stores can top 200,000 square feet. Maybe, officials thought,
   120,000 square feet--or even 80,000--was enough to achieve their
   economies of scale. At that size, a map of D.C. contains a whole lot
   more possibilities.

   Today, Walmart's four District spots have three things in common:
   They're in areas where grocery and retail options are scarce. They're
   privately controlled, meaning minimal regulatory hoops. And they have
   long trails of shredded plans behind them, making Walmart seem like a
   community savior.

   Take the [87]Ward 6 store, on New Jersey Avenue and H Street NW.
   Developer LuAnn Bennett got the rights to the parcel back in 1990. It's
   been empty ever since, passed over by potential tenants like the
   Department of Justice and National Public Radio. Now, nearby residents
   say they need an affordable grocery store. "We've been praying for food
   in this neighborhood for about 40 years," says Yvonne Williams, who
   chairs the board of trustees for the nearby Bible Way Church. "God has
   brought what was supposed to be here--a first-class, progressive
   thing."

   The [88]Ward 4 store, near Georgia and Missouri avenues, was a car
   dealership until 2007 and served as a mayoral re-election campaign
   office for Adrian Fenty last year. A deal with Costco didn't work out.
   Ditto plans for a mixed-use project. "We kept getting feedback like `we
   don't think that part of Georgia Avenue is ready yet,'" says Randall
   Clarke, past economic development chair of the Brightwood Community
   Association. "It's hard for me to wave the pitchfork about a retailer
   who came out of their own interest, without asking for city money or
   tax abatements or anything else."

   It's the same story at the [89]Ward 5 and [90]Ward 7 locations. The
   Ward 5 store, at Bladensburg Road NE and New York Avenue, will occupy a
   16-acre triangle of fenced-off lots and taxi depots where developer Jim
   Abdo's ill-fated housing, retail, and park project was supposed to
   rise. Ward 7's Walmart will sit near the Capitol Heights Metrorail
   station, on a site at [91]East Capitol and 58th streets NE that
   Shoppers Food Warehouse recently spurned. In each of these cases, the
   chain chose spots that missed out on D.C.'s economic boom, where a done
   deal seems better than a vacant lot.

   In fact, the willingness to accept Walmart as a catalyst for stalled
   developments extends all the way to the top. In the most public case of
   a pol trying to muscle the global giant, Mayor Vince Gray, at this
   year's Las Vegas retail convention, issued Walmart an ultimatum. But he
   wasn't looking for higher wages or local hiring, as he'd talked about
   publicly. Rather, [92]Gray demanded Walmart commit to a fifth location
   at Skyland Town Center, the run-down shopping complex near his own home
   in Hillcrest--or he'd kibosh the other four.

   It was a hollow threat, of course. But even if hadn't been, it wasn't
   exactly a case of a mayor playing hard to get. Walmart shrugged it off
   in a press release, and the city's economic development team quickly
   backed away.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Even though they'd picked sites that left few soft spots for opponents'
   grappling hooks, Walmart didn't skimp on its first line of defense.

   Superlobbyist David Wilmot had been on retainer since early 2006,
   collecting $290,000 over the next four years to lobby on legislation
   that affected Walmart's interests (like D.C.'s 2006 living-wage
   bill--which passed, but only applies to government-funded jobs). For
   the new push, the company hired a team including attorney [93]Claude
   Bailey, who handled legal matters for construction of the Walter E.
   Washington Convention Center, the Verizon Center, and Nationals
   stadium. He and consultant Brett Greene, who managed the finances for
   Gray's 2006 D.C. Council chairman campaign, worked community meetings,
   exchanging handshakes with local officials. For on-the-ground
   assistance in Ward 7, [94]Walmart brought on local Councilmember Yvette
   Alexander's campaign manager, Darryl Rose, and her campaign treasurer,
   Derek Ford. Restivo, Bailey, Walmart senior director of government
   affairs Bill Thorne, and Terry Lee from public relations firm Walker
   Marchant all showed up for meetings with councilmembers.

   Even though Walmart's people weren't asking for tax abatements or
   zoning changes, it was important to stay in the council's good graces.
   Elected officials could still make life difficult by fanning local
   opposition in ways that spooked developers--or by really pushing for
   legislation that would place restrictions on bigger retailers.
   (At-Large Councilmember [95]Phil Mendelson did introduce a bill
   requiring big boxes to pay living wages, but it hasn't gone anywhere.)

   In the old days of development, hiring the best lobbyists in town might
   be enough to pave a company's way. But given its controversial profile,
   Walmart also knew that it would have to wage a more public campaign
   addressing what Restivo calls "reputational issues."

   "We had to correct some misinformation that had gained some traction
   here, for better or for worse," he says. "I think not having a store
   here, and not having people be able to shop the brand, led to a lot of
   misperceptions about who we are."

   In the middle of last year, Walmart held a couple of focus groups at
   THEARC in Congress Heights, paying selected residents $100 and a boxed
   dinner to participate. According to Ward 8 community activist Phil
   Pannell, who was asked to take part, the subject was "economic
   development." But all the questions had to do with Walmart. Soon
   afterward, the company commissioned a poll of 800 District residents,
   finding 73 percent in favor of "one or more" Walmarts in the District
   (a [96]Quinnipiac poll found the favorability rating at 57 percent in
   New York City). Those results, in turn, were [97]printed on mailers
   that went out across the city, and given as talking points to T-shirted
   canvassers who are still out touting the benefits of fresh produce and
   cheap generic drugs.

   Walmart also worked the established media. The firm's national head of
   government affairs, Leslie Dach, met The Washington Post's editorial
   board; a [98]glowing editorial followed. Walmart bought ads everywhere
   from National Public Radio to The Washington Informer. Favorable clips
   from places like the extremist website NetRightDaily and Fox News were
   collected on the company's D.C.-specific website, which also contains
   rebuttals to anti-Walmart research, videos of D.C. residents excited
   about Walmart's arrival, and specifics touting the virtues of every
   different District location.

   The masterstrokes were subtler: Long-planned branding opportunities
   that just happened to reach fruition when the company needed to buff
   its image. In 2008, Walmart underwrote a traveling exhibit on the
   African-American experience, organized by NPR host Tavis Smiley. It
   happened to arrive in D.C. this spring. At a [99]black-tie opening
   reception at the National Geographic Museum, Smiley sang Walmart's
   praises to the leading figures in D.C.'s black community. Gray was on
   hand, posing for snapshots with top corporate execs.

   By then, the Walmart logo was everywhere. Walmart sponsored the
   warm-and-fuzzy "Choosing to Participate" multimedia exhibit at the
   Historical Society of Washington, D.C. On top of $200,000 doled out
   over the last five years, it pledged $50,000 to the Greater Washington
   Urban League, whose March gala featured Walmart regional general
   manager Alex Barron as honorary chair. A $400,000 gift to D.C. Hunger
   Solutions for fresh school breakfasts led to them pictures of tykes at
   a Trinidad charter school munching on grapes and bagels. In the biggest
   coup of all, [100]first lady Michelle Obama appeared on a
   Walmart-logoed stage to kick off an effort to make their house brands
   healthier.

   The Obama appearance put [101]avowed Walmart opponent Andy Shallal,
   owner of Busboys and Poets, over the edge. "Wal-Mart using
   #ShockDoctrine to enter DC market," he tweeted. "Their PR machine is
   amazing - Michelle Obama!? What next Jesus!?"
     __________________________________________________________________

   Around the same time Walmart was cozying up to the first lady, Restivo
   was also spinning less powerful people. Like me. He'd first asked me to
   coffee during an early-spring visit to D.C. In late May, he offered me
   a tour of Walmart's Alexandria store that opened eight months ago in a
   former Kmart. After that, he'd occasionally send emails on issues as
   they arose, or just direct my attention to the small number of "likes"
   on the union-backed anti-Walmart coalition's Facebook page.

   You can learn a lot about the company on a tour with a Walmart flack.
   It's about how the store is set up: "Action Alley," for example, is the
   wide aisle that has piles of stuff in the middle, so you can grab it as
   you walk. It's how the store is stocked: This location has a larger
   ethnic food section aimed at Hispanic and Asian populations, but
   managers figure that wealthier Alexandria residents also shop here, as
   evidenced by the high demand for ground turkey, which is more expensive
   than ground beef.

   Mostly, though, you learn that today's Walmart is actually very much
   like other grocery stores--just cheaper. "I won't say check out the
   prices and be self-promotional..." Restivo said, as we began. "But
   check out the prices." (Apparently this works: The journalist after me
   was conservative Washington Examiner columnist David Freddoso, who
   turned around a column the next day [102]praising Walmart's "bounty.")

   Maybe the bargains come on the backs of non-union workers and a
   crushing global supply chain. But when it comes down to it, the firm
   knows that plenty of shoppers are able to avoid focusing on that bigger
   picture. Walking into a town like you own it is a lot easier when you
   have the absolute confidence that market forces are on your side.
   Despite requiring more front-end effort than the Alexandria store, each
   of the four District sites stand to make much more money more quickly
   than a suburban location.

   No wonder Walmart wants in to D.C.: With sites on commuter
   thoroughfares, the chain can expect both to make money from local
   residents, and from suburbanites heading home. Right now, the commuting
   works the other way. In two of the community centers that hosted
   meetings about Walmarts, locals have long organized bus trips for
   residents to go to suburban locations of the store to stock up on
   bargain toilet paper. And in the Alexandria store, Restivo pointed out
   the other end of that phenomenon. Near the end of the tour, he told me
   to go check out all the D.C. license plates in the parking lot.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The rap on Walmart has long been its downsides for poor people: low
   wages, unattainable benefits, disrespect from managers, forced
   overtime, intimidation of attempts to unionize. In D.C., the company
   made a concerted effort to win over folks who might have the greatest
   problem with that--and turned a few into its most effective advocates.

   Late last year, Lori Kaplan, executive director of the Latin American
   Youth Center, was invited to the Walmart Foundation's downtown offices,
   where executives asked her to submit a grant application for her
   organization. She got it: $125,000 for youth summer enrichment, a
   lifeline at a time when the District's Summer Youth Employment Program
   had been slashed dramatically.

   At a February meeting at the Columbia Heights accounting firm Ayala &
   Associates, Kaplan and a dozen representatives from other Latino groups
   met Walmart officials including Tony Waller, the company's Puerto Rican
   senior director for corporate affairs and constituent relations. "I
   appreciate that they are willing to reach out to youth groups and the
   Latino community and sort of share their story, because since they
   never really were in Washington, my sense was stuff the press had said
   over the years," Kaplan says. "From the Youth Center's point of view,
   Walmart coming to Washington is a good thing. We would really like to
   develop a deeper partnership where we can be a source of employees, but
   also a place where employees won't just stay in the in the lowest-level
   retail position, but get the training to move up."

   In early November last year, several D.C. leaders were invited out to
   Walmart's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.--a couple hundred people
   all told, including delegates from the National Council of La Raza and
   other identity-based groups. It wasn't a high-budget trip. They stayed
   at a Hampton Inn and were fed boxed sandwiches and a buffet of barbecue
   and hush puppies. But Frankie Blackburn, a longtime community organizer
   with IMPACT Silver Spring, was won over.

   "I really did see a genuine commitment to changing the way they
   approach retail in a way that's responsive to these communities that
   are changing," she says. Blackburn was even excited by the possibility
   of having a new gathering point for the lower-income people she serves.
   "It's almost like a mini community center," she says. "Maybe they greet
   you and say `hey, would you like to know more about what's going on in
   the Shepherd Park neighborhood? Or maybe they host elementary school
   singing groups every Friday night, in the lobby of the Walmart. When
   you link it to retail, people are more likely to come out and see their
   neighbors singing and pick up toilet paper at the same time."

   In the end, Walmart's charm offensive even made a convert out of Manny
   Hidalgo, director of the Latino Economic Development Corporation, which
   has long recieved support from Walmart-owned Sam's Club. Hidalgo
   co-founded the District-wide business association [103]Think Local
   First with Shallal, but the two no longer speak. The restaurateur's
   anti-Walmart events and letters to the editor have made him perhaps the
   most prominent critic of the firm's arrival, [104]along with Yes!
   Organic Market owner Gary Cha, which irks Hidalgo.

   "I find that self-righteous approach to it shameful. That, to me, is a
   clear indication that you don't know the plight of hardworking poor
   people," Hidalgo says. "Is Andy Shallal going to bring a couple
   thousand jobs to the District? No. He lives in a beautiful home in
   Adams Morgan. Please get off the soapbox, come back to reality, and
   realize that this is a complex issue, and we owe it to the people of
   Washington to look at this."

   Shallal rejects that interpretation.

   "There's this idea that we're pitting people with means against people
   who don't have means, that these upper-middle-class people are
   dictating what lower income people can buy," Shallal says. "That's
   really a bunch of baloney. It's not about whether you're poor or rich.
   Most people who can afford to shop at Walmart can afford to shop
   elsewhere. It's really a choice."

   Hidalgo says an urban Walmart won't have the same baleful local impact
   as the rural version. "To continue to think of Walmart as the Walmart
   of before is a lost opportunity," he says. "You have to think about
   what Walmart can be...If all you do is oppose, oppose, oppose, what we
   call it in Spanish, you're viviendo del cuento--living off the story."

   It's easy to explain the support as a case of a firm buying loyalty
   with lavish spending. But Walmart's approach is more subtle: It's about
   character as much as cash. Rather than a cushy corporate junket,
   Hidalgo says the humble nature of his trip to Bentonville was what
   impressed him. "I realized, we're not talking about a monster, like
   everybody says. We're talking about America," he says, remembering the
   CEO jumping into taste-off for salmon sauces made by different
   wholesalers. "It's really a down-home corporation."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Walmart has spent many years and millions of dollars trying to sweeten
   its image among future collaborators and customers. As it turned out,
   even those who stand to lose from Walmart's presence didn't put up much
   of a fight.

   Take organized labor, which in other markets led the resistance. In the
   District, where private-sector unions have little muscle, organized
   labor accepted the premise that in a weak economy, nobody could stop
   Walmart from coming, no matter how hard they tried. When the United
   Food and Commercial Workers union [105]commissioned a poll last summer,
   it didn't ask, "are you in favor of Walmart?" It asked, "Would you
   support legislation to require big box stores to pay more than $12 an
   hour and hire from the surrounding community?" Some 76 percent of
   likely voters say yes, but the question itself was essentially an
   admission of defeat. Building trades unions joined the UFCW "Respect
   DC" coalition, which has proposed an 11-page city-wide
   community-benefits agreement. But they're more concerned about getting
   union members jobs on those construction sites than getting living
   wages for those who'll work within them.

   Another weak link in the Walmart resistance: small businesses. Despite
   Shallal's fiery activism, most of the sites are essentially commercial
   deserts. The only location with a real existing base of small
   businesses is the one on Georgia Avenue, but few have rallied to defend
   its junk shops and liquor stores. Especially when the firm has worked
   with nearby business groups to apply for federal grants--something the
   Beacon Brightwood Business Alliance needs a lot more than it needs
   living-wage regs. "They really just speak to regulating Walmart,"
   director Hasim Dawkins says, of Respect DC's demands. "They really
   don't talk about what we can do to revitalize a commercial district."

   Churches haven't acted in concert either. A meeting with Waller didn't
   win over the Wednesday Group, a fellowship of 30-odd social
   justice-oriented reverends and pastors. But other big blocs, like the
   Downtown Cluster of Congregations and the Washington Interfaith
   Network, didn't even add their names to the list of organizations in
   support, saying they were preoccupied with other campaigns.

   All that left a scattered opposition of ideologues--whose "Walmart-Free
   D.C." campaign didn't do its side any favors by showing up to
   grandstand and distribute hyperbolic literature at every meeting--and
   people concerned about things like traffic and drainage, which have
   nothing to do with who's on the lease. That's not a coalition that was
   going to tax all of Bentonville's fabled political power.

   Without any prospect of actually blocking Walmart, the only thing
   opponents have left is asking for concessions. And there, Walmart has
   done a great job of dangling the possibility of cooperation with
   various groups, while committing to none. At community meetings,
   Walmart liaison Keith Morris dances around questions about whether the
   chain will sign a document, saying that any package of benefits would
   need to be tailored to each neighborhood.

   Two of the neighborhoods already have community benefits agreements
   requiring the developers to kick back some money, both resulting from
   zoning processes unique to those sites. But neither of those agreements
   asks anything of Walmart itself. For concessions like a higher starting
   wage and local hiring, the Gray administration has drafted its own
   community-benefits agreement, but kept it under wraps. Walmart, after
   all, doesn't have to sign anything.

   And at every turn, Walmart has made the case that it in itself is a
   community benefit. Top politicians certainly seem glad to help spread
   that message. Just as Respect DC was staging a rally, Gray--who was
   elected last year with overwhelming labor support--announced that
   [106]Walmart had donated $665,000 for the city's summer youth
   programming. It's hard to demand more from someone while you're busy
   thanking them for their generosity.

   Even politicians on the council's left wing see little to dislike about
   the massive company, despite its small-business-stifling,
   workers-rights-trampling reputation.

   "The life has already been sucked out of downtown," says Wells. "We're
   trying to build it back. And America is used to shopping at discount
   retailers and we have a tremendous amount of leakage. So when we say
   `what are the community benefits before we allow you in here,' it's
   under that paradigm." The Walmart in Wells' ward contains 300 units of
   workforce housing and retail bays for small businesses fronting the
   street; he's also working with the chain to fund a training program at
   the University of the District of Columbia.

   Looked at one way, Walmart's cakewalk is an illustration of D.C.'s
   southern nature: Trusting of big business, grateful for investment,
   deeply skeptical of unions. Ward 5 Councilmember Harry Thomas Jr.,
   often a big labor backer, has been Walmart's biggest cheerleader. And
   in Ward 4, Councilmember Muriel Bowser doesn't think organized labor
   should get any special deference. "Dues-paying members are concerned
   that Walmart will drive down wages, and they won't be able to negotiate
   for as much," she says. "So that's as self-interested an argument as
   any." It may be true. But setting up consumers and workers as two
   different interests is classic anti-union boilerplate, and not the sort
   of argument Walmart's cadres usually hear in northern cities.

   Looked at in another way, however, it's just more evidence of D.C.'s
   division along the lines of race and class. Tracy Sefl, a Democratic
   strategist who helped found Walmart Watch, notes that the people most
   disposed to think about Walmart's global labor practices are less
   inclined to get involved at the city level. "The sort of cognoscenti
   that would have been and is engaged in this Walmart opposition
   intellectually as liberal activists hasn't translated here in the same
   way, because Walmart hasn't said we're going to put the stores in
   Spring Valley," Sefl says, referring to the rich, leafy Ward 3
   neighborhood. "Walmart would say, this was purely economics, and
   they're siting their stores where it makes sense to be. It still means
   they bypass that often white opposition."

   Over coffee at a café off U Street NW--not Busboys and Poets, which a
   P.R. rep laughingly declined--Restivo offered a made-in-Bentonville
   take, born of triumphs in much tougher environments than the
   District's. With dead-serious eyes, he predicted the future as if some
   higher being had clued him in.

   "When each of these stores opens in the District, there will be tens of
   thousands of customers who come in and out every day," he said. "Those
   are folks who probably never wrote a letter to the editor, never showed
   up at an ANC meeting, never went and voiced their opinion to their
   councilmember, yet they're going to vote for every day with their
   pocketbook. And that's a fact that our critics just can't dispute. And
   so as a result, they try to leverage lots of noise and misinformation,
   and that's taken to be opposition. But in reality, when those stores
   open, they will be extremely busy, and customers will be saving lots
   and lots of money."

   I hope Walmart will work directly with community groups and not just
   the Mayor and City Council to complete some community projects that are
   near and dear to local neighborhood revitilization. The Ron Moten
   Committee is working as "Friends to Woodlawn Memorial Park". The
   historical African American cemetry is the final resting place to such
   notables as US Senator Blanche K. Bruce (R-MS 1875-1881) and
   Congressman John M.Langston (R-VA 1889-1893). This site has been

   FUCK WALMART!!!
   THOSE ASSHOLES WAS RELUCTANT TO COMMIT WHEN W.D.C. WAS DOWN AND THEY
   DIDNT SEE PROMISE. NOW THEY WANT TO JUMP ON BOARD AFTER EVERYONE ELSE
   HAVE LAYED THE GROUNDWORK, IS DOING WELL AND WAS HERE DURING THE
   COME-UP!
   READERS GOOGLE WALMART LOCATIONS IN MD AND VA YOU WILL NOTICE THERE IS
   ONLY 1 IN MO COUNTY AND ONLY 1 INSIDE THE BELTWAY. ASK YOURSELF `WHY IS
   THAT?' THEN CONTACT THE BAMMAS AND ASK THEM WHY.
   THIS SHIT IS EQUIVALENT TO SOME JOKER GETTING A BROAD PREGNANT AFTER
   PROMISING HE WILL TAKE CARE OF HER AND HER 3 CHILDREN. AFTER HE WINED &
   DINED HER AND BOUGHT THE CHICKADEES A COUPLE OF OUTFITS HE GOT HER
   RIGHT WHERE HE WANTS HER. THEN BOOM~! HE'S ABANDONED HER, THE CHILDREN
   HE GASSED UP AND THE NEWBORN. SHE KEPT HER HEAD ABOVE WATER WITH ONLY 3
   CHILDREN BUT THE 4TH TOOK HER UNDER. NOW THE VICIOUS CYCLE BEGINS. THIS
   IS WALMART COMING INTO D.C. YA'LL AND WE ARE THE PREGNANT WOMAN.
   FOLKS DONT BE DUPED BY BEING PUT ON PROMISE STREET! WASHINGTON D.C.
   DOESNT NEED WALMART (ESPECIALLY IN WARD 4!). WALMART NEEDS WAHSINTON
   D.C.! OF COURSE ALL THOSE LATINO ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO JUMP ON
   BOARD. WE ALL KNOW WHY! SERIOUSLY WE DONT NEED OR WANT THE TYPE OF
   FOLKS WALMART ATTRACTS, THE NOISE, ACTIVITY, TRAFFIC AND EVERYTHING
   ELSE ASSOCIATED WITH FOLKS COMING FROM MO COUNTY, WARDS 2 & 3 AND THE
   VA. FOLKS SCARED TO VENTURE DOWNTOWN. ALL THE STUPID MOFO'S IN THEIR
   UNDERSIZED NEON SPANDEX, DRIVING ALL OUT THE WAY TO FORCE FEED THEIR
   GLUTTONY TO SAVE $1.50 ON SOME PROCESSED FISH PLANKS, A CASE OF NO-NAME
   PURIFIED WATER WHILE SUCKING DOWN 2 FOR $2 BIG MACS.
   ONE NEED ONLY TO LOOK AT TAVIS SMILEY'S SELL OUT ASS TO KNOW WALMART
   SUBTLE ATTEMPTS TO WOO BLACK MONEY INTO THEIR STOCKHOLDERS POCKETS. THE
   RURAL AND EXTREME SUBURBAN WHITE FOLKS ARE BROKE AND UNEMPLOYED. THEY
   ARE NOT SPENDING LIKE THEY USED TO DO. THEY KNOW THE BLACK URBAN DOLLAR
   HAS SUSTAINED MEDIUM TO SMALL BUSINESSES FOR DECADES DESPITE RIOTS,
   DRUGS AND BLACK ON BLACK CRIME. I'M SURE THEY'VE NOTICED THAT SAFEWAY
   AND GIANT HAVE NOT GONE UNDER. THAT IS WHY THEY ARE PUSHING THAT

   "Today, Walmart's four District spots have three things in common:
   They're in areas where grocery and retail options are scarce ... The
   Ward 4 store, near Georgia and Missouri avenues ..."
   There is a large, full service Safeway at the intersection of Georgia
   and Van Buren, less than a mile from the proposed Walmart site at
   Georgia and Missouri Avenues in Ward 4--according to Mapquest, it's
   0.61 miles--a bit over a half mile. Directly across the street from
   that Safeway is a CVS. Say what you will about Safeway and CVS, the
   fact is that this area of Ward 4 has a large grocery store and a drug
   store in close proximity to the proposed site, so in terms of groceries
   and pharmacy, it's not underserved. In terms of other retail options, I
   would agree that pickings are quite slim. I live very close to the
   Safeway and CVS and it puzzles me why reporters always say that there
   are not grocery options in this part of town in articles about the
   Walmart proposal, when Safeway and CVS are so close to the Ward 4 site.

   Ward 4...
   1) The Supreme Court has made it known that Walmart can not be
   successfully sued in their High Court. So, do not look to your
   Councilmember to fight your battle against Walmart should the retailer
   renege on a promise.
   2) I foresee Walmart doing a CVS and a Home Depot on your "trusting
   Citizens" at the cash register. That is, reduce the number of cashiers
   and replace them with self-service lanes.
   3) Don't forget the U.S. commerce policy to save and support [big
   business] Walmart...because they are "to Big to Fail".
   4) I see wooden boards on the doors and store front windows at Rite-Aid
   [Geo.Ave & Madison]; boards on CVS [Van Buren] and large boards at the
   Safeway [Piney Branch Rd.]
   5) A traffic mess at the Georgia Avenue and Missouri Road
   intersection...
   and everyday of the week including Church Sundays [day and night]
   TRAFFIC BACK-UP ON GEORGIA AVE. FROM THE MARYLAND STATE LINE south to
   New Hampshire Avenue, N.w.
   Ward 4 life is about choices...and deception and lies and trusting
   others at their word that will and can change whatever was promised in
   the past.
   Not a Sermon...just a thought.

   At a time when the city is facing budget cuts of at least 65 million,
   why wouldn't the get some funds to offset these cuts. Funds that would
   be sent directly to road improvement, schools or parks and recreation
   or summer jobs to get the kids off the streets? I guess another Walmart
   is better than a balanced budget.

   Please-
   1) the supreme court case was about getting class action status for the
   case. The Supreme Court made no ruling on the merits. There is a
   difference.
   2) Self service lines are in part a direct result of customer
   dissatisfaction with cashiers. It is all about convenience for the
   shopper. Why wouldn't a company implement a change that will save them
   money AND make the shoppers happier.
   3) Seriously? Big businesses fail all the time. Walmart would nit
   behaved if they mismanage and go bankrupt. What happened with the banks
   is SOOO not even comparable.
   4) Rite-Aid is dieing even without Walmart. They have been in the top
   10 businesses sure to fail stories for over a year now. CVS is all
   about convenience and being the only "quickie" mart up that way they
   are not going anywhere. People are still going to want the places where
   they can quickly get in and out to get what they need. Considering that
   Safeway is the only other full service grocer in Ward 4 ( and remember
   the other Safeway near the Petworth metro will be closed for a long
   time while they renovate)....I have a hard time believing that they
   will be driven to close.
   5) A traffic mess will occur at that intersection no matter what is put
   at that location and is no different from when the dealership was there
   or the Hechinger before it. Georgia is no picnic to drive down or up at
   any point of day. It is a main artery in the city and is expected to
   congested.

   Lazy journalism for putting forth the "bringing water to the food
   desert" canard.
   Walmart started waving its "we're the best thing to happen to the
   inner-city since indoor plumbing" banner shortly after it was glaringly
   obvious that the Feed DC Act was going to be passed passed. For those
   unaware, this is universally popular City Council legislation designed
   to provide subsidies to grocery stores and corner stores in blighted
   areas that seek to improve access to fresh produce. Yet not only will
   it have access to these taxpayer funds (it claims it isn't seeking
   subsidies and they're right in a sense - subsidies have found them) it
   will have an overall detrimental affect as academic study after
   academic study - those NOT funded by the retailer - show that new
   Walmarts lead to net job losses; never mind their horrible record on
   labor relations. More welcome grocery stores and corner stores -
   ventures that are less destructive and overbearing -will lose out to
   Walmart if nothing is done, and these neighborhoods won't live up to
   their potential.
   And sure, Walmart might donate money here and there, but how much in
   tax breaks does it earn them? And how did they get such massive sums to
   "donate" in the first place? They didn't become the biggest corporation
   - and the biggest retailer in the US by a factor of 5 - by writing
   checks and being community friendly.In fact, one of Walmart's policies
   is necessitating that store managers, when they are first hired, move
   to stores 100 miles from where they are from. And the reason for this
   is to install managers with a sense of detachment from the community
   that they are pillaging.
   Fuck these Bentonville Viceroys. This is going to be terrible for DC
   and shame on all our city councilors for selling us out without a fight
   (did they give you a free ride in a fully loaded SUV?) And shame -
   absolute shame - on The City Paper for this puff piece; for quoting
   Walmart issued surveys like they were gospel; and for not questioning
   why our notoriously corrupt city council is bending over backwards for
   these parasites.

   What is interesting about this story isn't just that it feels very much
   like a puff piece for Walmart (notice that the only quote from someone
   who opposed Walmart is discredited by someone who has been bought off
   by them), it's that the story has been written as though this is done.
   Not one permit or license has been issued, no Large Tract Review or PUD
   approved, no ground has been broken.
   Lydia is famous for snarky headlines that don't always match up to the
   story below, as this headline reads "How Walmart won over DC without a
   fight." Not "How Walmart Bought DC." Which is what the story really
   covers, though without any real analysis, is the politicians and
   organizations that accepted vast contributions (read: bribes). For
   example, Manny Hidalgo from LEDC, how much did his organization receive
   from Walmart? Why is that not reported here? Or how his organization
   surveyed small businesses in Ward 4
   (http://ledcmetro.wordpress.com/2010/12/21/so-what-do-small-businesses-
   think-about-the-walmart-store-in-ward-4/) and found that 57 % of the
   small businesses thought that Walmart would have a negative impact on
   the community. What amount of money has caused them to take such a
   strong pro- Walmart position and now call them a "down home
   corporation?" Give us some real numbers on these contributions.
   What about campaign contributions? How much did Mayor Gray and other
   councilmembers get from Walmart and Developers? Did you FOIA anyone or
   any agencies?
   Ending an article with a paragraph long quote from a Walmart PR person
   does not wrap up a story in a conclusive way. It is not the kind of
   analysis we hope to have from a cover story in the City Paper. It feels
   cute, but lazy. We know Lydia is one of the hardest working reporters
   in town, so why use this tactic?
   I will not hide that I am opposed to Walmart and am working with the
   community to make sure that IF they come to DC they should agree in
   writing to conditions that take care of our communities and don't leave
   our city devastated like we have seen in other places in Walmart's
   past.
   Many residents throughout the city are upset about the way our
   officials and others have been purchased by the corporation. They have
   bought silence from some, and pitchmen in others like Kaplan and
   Hidalgo. Will we be seeing Walmart ads in the City Paper soon?

   Hard choices. Yes we need jobs, but they need to be sustainable.
   Walmart is gonna pay a buck or so above minimum wage and very few of
   these 1,200 new employees will be able to afford the company's health
   insurance. A year after they open if 20% of employees are on the
   company's healthcare plan, I'll be shocked. So explain to me how this
   really helps DC? We do get sales and property tax revenues but those
   are partially or fully offset by other negative impacts.
   As an example there's research out there about the # of Walmart
   employees' kids on public health insurance (programs like Badger Care
   in WI; PeachCare in GA etc) and it's usually very high. So our DC or
   Federal tax dollars end up circling back around to provide health care
   of poor workers children. (Which incidentally is a subsidy to the
   company, just an indirect one.)

   I think I'm missing the "quality journalism" aspect folks are praising
   here. The headline makes it an op-ed over a supposedly done deal which
   hasn't actually closed yet.
   Maybe it's just me, but I think "quality journalism" would be taking a
   close look at the actual impact Wal-Mart has when it enters a
   community, and then assessing the claims Wal-Mart makes against
   results. Similarly, assessing the claims made by the anti-Wal-Mart
   contingent would help the reader to get a better understanding of
   what's at stake here, rather than just getting the P.R. from either
   side. I'm actually offended by the headline that implies the whole
   city's been won over, rather than a half dozen non-profits and a, shall
   we say, ethically challenged City Council.
   Here's where I went for info when I first heard Wal-Mart wanted in.
   Granted, it's an advocacy site, but many of the articles are
   peer-reviewed, and they didn't take me out for coffee:
   http://www.newrules.org/retail/key-studies-walmart-and-bigbox-retail
   I don't shop at Wal-Mart and don't miss it, so they're not bringing
   anything to town I need or want, except jobs for my neighbors. My
   conclusion is that Wal-Mart does not produce real jobs. Period. We, the
   citizens of DC, will supplement their low wages with food stamps and
   Medicaid. I'm not paying taxes to subsidize the world's biggest
   corporation.
   Please stay with this story. It deserves a lot of detailed attention.

   I am dismayed that this article repeatedly cites the Wal-Mart claim
   that the four locations will create 1200 retail jobs without also
   citing the opposition claim (and the result of numerous studies)
   indicating that 1.5 jobs are lost from small businesses closing once a
   new Wal-Mart opens for every job created by that same new Wal-Mart
   location. This is a shamefully unbalanced piece that fails to cite the
   empirical data cited by Wal-Mart opponents. There isn't even any
   mention of the massive sex discrimination case against Wal-Mart for
   which the Supreme Court decided class certification was not
   appropriate, without ruling on the underlying merits of the claims of
   scores of women who allege sex discrimination by Wal-Mart.
   I don't care about ad hominem attacks against Andy Shallal for the size
   of his house, I care about reporters sincerely making the effort to
   quote the empirical arguments of both sides of a contentious issue,
   statistics included.

   Good piece of journalism, but it would be better as a part of a series,
   exploring consumer opinions, history of commercial development in DC,
   and prospective economic impact.
   Once Walmart comes in, there will be no getting rid of it unless DC
   itself fails, and that's what concerns me. My neighborhood treasures
   its independent businesses, small storefronts, and minimal congestion.
   Local businesses keep local funds in local neighborhoods, and the
   patrons' dollars don't often make the trip to billionaire CEOs in
   Alabama or Chinese manufacturers with dire labor and environmental
   records.
   It saddens me when my neighbors choose not to see the bigger picture.
   Walmart's past has shown that promises often wither; whether it be
   relative to wages, community sponsorship, or environment. At the end of
   the day, a corporation expects to make a buck and the stock holders
   expect it to make a buck more than it did yesterday. Walmart will do
   that, and it will do so on the backs of the poor, the local businesses,
   and the environment.
   I know I'll never shop there, but I'm sad that my neighborhood will
   still see the negative impact of their presence.

   That Chicago study was worthless. The authors knew what they wanted to
   prove and used flawed methods to get them there. There are lots of
   effective rebuttals to it, just google it.
   Even if the conclusions about its impacts on the Chicago community were
   not cooked, there is no parallel with DC, at not least in Ward 4 where
   I live. The Chicago neighborhood had shoe stores and clothing
   stores--we have none. We have liquor stores, pawn shops, takeout
   restaurants, hair cutters and ethnic grocery stores. Plus we have a
   really lousy, lazy Safeway at Piney Branch that might have to improve
   were it to face more competition for its customers.
   I don't track the argument that Walmart jobs are not good enough for
   our unemployed workers in DC. Suppose we had a healthy mix of small
   businesses in that area. How many jobs would they generate and what
   kind of wages would they pay? Would they provide health insurance?
   Would our work force be better off?
   That section of Georgia Avenue is like a mouth full of rotten teeth,
   with a big gap where that empty car dealership stands. I never hear
   seen a viable alternative scenario from the development opponents.
   So the situation is complex. It deserves careful consideration, not a
   knee-jerk reaction.
   I thought the author of this article handled the nuances very capably.

   The Chicago study isnt the only one that shows Walmart to be bad for

   sounds like it came straight from a Walmart PR Sock Puppet.

   At the risk of ruing my credibility on this forum, I am going to defend
   LDP and this piece. LDP has been consistently critical and suspicious
   of Walmart and I hope that all criticizing the piece will dig deeper on
   her views. More importantly, I do not read this as a puff piece of
   Walmart. I actually read it as the opposite. To me, this piece
   highlights the scorched earth mentality and ruthlessness that Walmart
   unleashes when it wants into a market. The way this piece is written,
   it does not portray Walmart as a community friendly Pollyanna of a
   retailer - it merely demonstrates how Walmart feels that way about
   itself and is willing to launch a full PR and political assault to get
   its message out. I would urge all of you to read the piece again with
   that in mind.
   As for Walmart coming to DC. I have some comments or observations. One,
   I am reminded of the old Harlem and Bronx numbers rackets...which were
   run locally by Blacks and the Irish at the beginning of the 20th
   Century. When the Mafia decided that they wanted the Harlem numbers
   money for themselves, they swooped in, bribed people, killed people and
   either bought or took out the competition. I am not saying the Walmart
   is a criminal enterprise, but you get my point. Walmart wants in and
   they have the resources and the savvy enough to make it happen. It will
   happen. They are playing Bridge and everyone else is playing 52 Pickup.
   Geez, look at it folks. Second, Walmart targeted sites that had been
   undeveloped or underdeveloped for years - the most vulnerable places.
   It KNEW that no one had any viable alternatives for those sites because
   no one with deep pockets stepped up to complete development on those
   sites. All prior attempts had failed or never launched. It KNEW that
   the politicians in those wards (and District-wide) need a defining
   victory. It KNEW that the NIMBY factions and small business factions
   would not be a major threat because they cannot unleash the same
   resources and Walmart had already bought the politicians. Finally, it
   watched Target test the waters and make a killing in Columbia Heights
   (with significant City help) and it KNEW that JAWB would welcome it
   because Walmart did not have its hand out on the front end. All that is
   left to say is ... CHECKMATE!

   A retailer wanting to open a store here is a matter of right. To my
   knowledge there is no legal precedent that says that if a vocal
   minority objects, it won't get approved. DC officials are being accused
   of being "bribed" for following their own guidelines?
   Less emotional outrage, and more facts would be nice.
   Also, if people across town protest the stores, but most people in the
   areas themselves are fine with them, why should the first group feel
   they deserve more clout? Why do they think they're superior?
   Little wonder I can't stand you people. You got your Target with no
   friction at all, in an area that had almost no retail. Now let people
   in other areas remain stuck with empty lots becasue YOU don't like that
   particular store, and tell them they're better off for it. You're a
   bunch of self-righteous hypocrites.

   Look at that, Andy thinks that Walmart wrote this. Walmart was the
   first to tweet and repost this story. I guess they also felt like it
   made them look good. I'm clearly not the only one to think it's a puff
   piece.
   Walmart is the best store in Indiana, PA. Is Indiana a new foreign
   sister city to DC that I didn't know about?

   I find it ironic, even tragic, that the NGOs who minister to society's
   poor apparently do not realize that the ranks of the poor are swelled
   by the economic practices pioneered by Wal-Mart, and the social
   policies pursued by the Walton family. Lori Kaplan and Manny Hidalgo
   give cover to the corporation and the family even as they work to
   destroy the middle class.

   Indeed, the story wasn't about people who oppose Walmart's coming to
   D.C., six stores strong--we're merely ideologues.

   By the end of the story, the reader can tell that it would have taken a
   strong reporter to resist Walmart's well-oiled PR machine. By the end
   of the story, too, anyone who understands the significance of who a
   reporter quotes in their final paragraph, understands that LDP wasn't
   strong enough.
