Front Row to Fashion Week

   By Mike Bostock, Shan Carter, Erik Hinton, Cathy Horyn and Eric Wilson
   September 12, 2013

   Of the more than 300 collections shown during New York Fashion Week,
   here were the ones that created the most buzz and left the biggest
   impressions on fashion editors as they headed off to the next round of
   shows in London, Milan and Paris.

Calvin Klein

   A beautiful, innovative collection in which Francisco Costa layered
   references to urban tribes, â80s art, handcraft and even, seemingly,
   radical chicks of the 1920s. It added up to a modern expression of
   fashion.

   Read more: [5]Calvin Klein in Full Color
     * Sand-colored, orange-accented canvas wrapped into a dress and suit
     * A large emerald tweed coat with frayed, pronounced seams
     * A boxy black jacket fringed with multicolored confetti strings

Proenza Schouler

   A challenging collection, inspired by the notion of home and interiors,
   it nonetheless showed the designers in a simpler vein.

   Read more: [6]Pleats and Prints
     * Dresses vined with a flossy fiber print
     * Loose pants outlined in cream hand-painted strokes
     * Long skirts accordioned into fine metallic pleats

Michael Kors

   Sometimes fashion is all about timing. His conservative-chic clothes,
   including navy blazers, cuffed denim shorts and belted full-skirted
   dresses, sounded an optimistic note.

   Read more: [7]Michael Kors Doesnât Break a Sweat
     * A woven bag resembling a rolled-up doormat
     * A sky blue dress shirt ringed with cloudlike fluffy white fox
     * Superwide lounge pants
     * A grass-colored bikini was embroidered with white daisies

Narciso Rodriguez

   With new proportions, shorter hemlines and a simplified look, he
   refreshed his minimalist style. His proposal for layering was also
   modern â a trim wrap skirt over matching shorts.

   Read more: [8]Fragments of Beauty
     * Ultra-feminine Jacquards resembling brocades
     * The mollusk pink of a seashell's interior

Oscar de la Renta

   He presented a variety of styles and attitudes in one collection â
   snooty tweed suits, pretty lace separates, Spanish evening fantasies â
   but there was no feeling of role-playing. He made glamour seem natural.

   Read more: [9]Four Collections, Four Successes
     * A lanky, white-lapel coat over a checked wool skirt
     * Faille cocktail dresses in birthday-cake pastels
     * A ridiculous froth of sorbet pink tulle

Thom Browne

   Thom Browne continues to provoke. Ignore the Elizabethan silhouettes
   and focus on the incredible fabrics and the beautiful effect.

   Read more: [10]A Contemplation of Insanity at Thom Browne
     * Steampunk nurses in stiff white lace
     * White stuffed kittens on a leash of pearls
     * Frank Gehry-esque pleated silk constructions

Altuzarra

   It was just a skirt and a shirt, but done with sophistication. And he
   refreshed the idea of the practical, inspiring high fashion.

   Read more: [11]Altuzarraâs Imaginative Take on Humble Threads
     * Exceptional one-piece tops creating the illusion of layers
     * Enlarged prints of French ticking stripes
     * A tuxedo jacket closed by a single strap over a naked bust

Fashion Fingerprints

   Color is an important part of the ideas and trends that emerge during
   Fashion Week. Each look is broken into a minimal stack of color bars,
   then combined to abstract the collectionâs hues.
