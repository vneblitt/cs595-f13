Harvard's São Paulo office establishes connections in Brazil and Cambridge

   This is the fourth in a [83]series of stories about Harvard's
   engagement in Latin America.

   SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- At 6 feet 4 inches, Jason Dyett cuts an imposing
   figure as he navigates the chaos that is São Paulo traffic.

   "We need to be a little bit careful, but also aggressive," said Dyett,
   guiding visitors through a hectic crosswalk in Brazil's largest city,
   population 11 million, toward the local office of Harvard's [84]David
   Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies (DRCLAS), a regional hub
   that supports faculty and students in research, teaching, and learning
   throughout the country.
   rockefelleroffice_570

   Harvard students, an alumnus from the Harvard Kennedy School, and a
   lecturer at Harvard's Graduate School of Design gathered in the DRCLAS
   office in São Paulo to offer practical suggestions to two Brazilian
   scholars bound for Harvard this fall.

   Dyett's rush-hour calm also characterizes his approach on the job. With
   a mix of determination and diplomacy, Dyett, the office's longtime
   program director, helps link Harvard faculty and students to resources
   and collaborators in Brazil, while simultaneously facilitating
   connections across Harvard.

   "Harvard can help bring together different parts of Brazil," he said.
   "At the same time, we have a big focus in terms of trying to bridge
   opportunities wherever possible at Harvard. We are a University-wide
   office, which creates tremendous opportunities because there are
   important overlaps that exist between and within different
   disciplines."

   In the late afternoon, Harvard students and staff gathered to discuss
   their work and research in the office's conference room, a fusion of
   bright wood and windows on the 17th floor of a high-rise in the city's
   downtown. Efforts in public health and early childhood development were
   among the topics, as was the importance of the opportunity to branch
   out beyond Cambridge.

   Harvard College senior Shahil Mehta is working at the University of São
   Paulo on prenatal nutrition.

   The Brazil Studies Program at Harvard and the DRCLAS Brazil office,
   both established in 2006, together support a wide range of programs and
   student and faculty research in Cambridge and Brazil. Among their
   initiatives: annual collaborative field courses that unite students and
   faculty from Harvard and Brazil around issues in public health and
   environmental engineering, and ongoing research collaborations between
   the [86]Harvard School of Public Health, the Universidade de São Paulo
   Medical School, the Santa Casa de São Paulo Medical School, and other
   institutions.

   Harvard senior Shahil Mehta, an organismic and evolutionary biology
   concentrator on a pre-med track, described his work with a nutrition
   professor at the University of São Paulo, a mentor he connected with
   through the help of DRCLAS and a fellowship at the [87]Harvard Global
   Health Institute (HGHI). Mehta and fellow senior Jenny Zhang spent the
   summer exploring how a lipid-based supplement could impact preterm
   birth rates in the Amazon.

   As important as their work in the lab, they agreed, were their
   connections with Brazilian students, professors, and locals. During
   their two-month stay the undergraduates shadowed Brazilian medical
   students, becoming familiar with the practices and policies associated
   with the country's health care system. They also witnessed a piece of
   history as hundreds of thousands of Brazilians flooded the streets in
   June to demand the government spend more money on education and health
   care, and less on the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.

   Harvard College senior Miranda Mckinley Ravicz is working in Brazil as
   part of the David Rockefeller Center's early childhood development
   initiative.

   "It's been really important to see the protests, the way health care is
   practiced here, to talk to students here to see ... what their
   motivations are to go into health care," said Mehta. "It puts my
   motivations ... into a grander perspective. To be able to understand
   someone across the world, in an entirely different environment, with an
   entirely different medical philosophy -- to see the similarities and
   differences helps me understand why I want to be a doctor."

   As afternoon faded to evening, the conversation in the conference room
   shifted to counsel. An alumnus of [89]Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) and
   a lecturer at the [90]Graduate School of Design (GSD) offered practical
   suggestions to two Brazilian scholars bound for Harvard this fall,
   including valuable advice about how best to connect with people,
   programs, and initiatives at the University.

   Sam Downing, who received a master's degree in public policy and urban
   planning from HKS and now works in the [91]U.S. Consulate in São Paulo,
   encouraged businessman-turned-social activist Oded Grajew to scout out
   the School's [92]Roy and Lila Ash Center for Democratic Governance and
   Innovation. "That's a great place to get started, and I think you have
   a lot of similar interests. ... The [93]Center for Business and
   Government would be another logical place." He also urged Grajew to
   share his own intimate knowledge about Brazil with the Harvard
   community.

   "There is a huge appetite, both at Harvard and broadly in the U.S.
   right now in figuring out what has happened to Brazil over the past 20
   years, what has happened over the past two weeks. What did the protests
   mean? ... What kind of connections are there between Brazilian NGOs
   [nongovernmental organizations] and U.S. NGOs?

   Harvard College senior Jenny Zhang is working at the University of São
   Paulo School of Public Health, studying the effects of lipid-based
   nutrient supplements on preterm birth rates in the Amazon.

   "All of us in some way are trying to make the U.S. understanding of
   Brazil more nuanced, and I would encourage you to do that and seek out
   opportunities to talk about what's going on here."

   Gareth Doherty, a GSD lecturer studying Brazilian favelas for the
   summer, provided some advice on time management. Visiting scholars he's
   known, he said, have  "realized that if they went to every lecture and
   every event that interested them, that it actually becomes more than a
   full-time job. ... Make sure you have time for yourself, to carve out
   that space."

   Along with making introductions, Dyett and his team have developed a
   hyperconnected virtual world. Past a wall filled with photographs of
   students and faculty who have worked in the office, and a picture of
   Harvard President Drew Faust from her visit to São Paulo in 2011, sits
   Dyett's desk. There he proudly displayed the product of several years
   of work: a comprehensive database that resembles a 6 degrees of
   separation computer game.

   Isamar Vega '13 is working at the University of São Paulo on various
   initiatives to connect students and faculty at Harvard with students
   and faculty in Brazil.

   Names, pictures, and biographical and contact information flashed on
   his screen. With the tap of a button, a small subset of the thousands
   of the Brazilian and Harvard contacts in his system appeared, arranged
   in a circle and connected by interests and fields of study.

   "This is everything we have done since 2006, by categories and
   disciplines which map to Harvard," said Dyett of the database, compiled
   by a group of local programmers who worked part time in the office and
   now run their own startups in Brazil. "It's customized for what we
   need."
