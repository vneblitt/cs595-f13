   More and more people are making their homes in woodland settings - in
   or near forests, rural areas, or remote mountain sites. There,
   homeowners enjoy the beauty of the environment but face the very real
   danger of wildfire.

   Every year across our Nation, some homes survive - while many others do
   not - after a major wildfire. Those that survive almost always do so
   because their owners had prepared for the eventuality of fire, which is
   an inescapable force of nature in fire-prone wildland areas. Said in
   another way - if it's predictable, it's preventable!

   Wildfires often begin unnoticed. They spread quickly, igniting brush,
   trees, and homes. Reduce your risk by preparing now - before wildfire
   strikes. Meet with your family to decide what to do and where to go if
   wildfires threaten your area. Follow the steps listed below to protect
   your family, home, and property.

Practice Wildfire Safety

   People start most wildfires - find out how you can promote and practice
   wildfire safety.
     * Contact your local fire department, health department, or forestry
       office for information on fire laws.
     * Make sure that fire vehicles can get to your home. Clearly mark all
       driveway entrances and display your name and address.
     * Report hazardous conditions that could cause a wildfire.
     * Teach children about fire safety. Keep matches out of their reach.
     * Post fire emergency telephone numbers.
     * Ensure adequate accessibility by large fire vehicles to your
       property.
     * Plan several escape routes away from your home - by car and by
       foot.
     * Talk to your neighbors about wildfire safety. Plan how the
       neighborhood could work together after a wildfire. Make a list of
       your neighbors' skills such as medical or technical. Consider how
       you could help neighbors who have special needs such as elderly or
       disabled persons. Make plans to take care of children who may be on
       their own if parents can't get home.

Before Wildfire Threatens

   Design and landscape your home with wildfire safety in mind. Select
   materials and plants that can help contain fire rather than fuel it.
   Use fire-resistant or noncombustible materials on the roof and exterior
   structure of the dwelling, or treat wood or combustible material used
   in roofs, siding, decking, or trim with fire-retardant chemicals
   evaluated by a nationally recognized laboratory. Plant fire-resistant
   shrubs and trees. For example, hardwood trees are less flammable than
   pine, evergreen, eucalyptus or fir trees.

   Your best resource for proper planning is [107]www.firewise.org which
   has outstanding information used daily by residents, property owners,
   fire departments, community planners, builders, public policy
   officials, water authorities, architects and others to assure safety
   from fire - it really works. Firewise workshops are offered for free
   all across the Nation in communities large and small and free Firewise
   materials can be obtained easily by anyone interested.

Create a 30- to 100-foot safety zone around your home

   Within this area, you can take steps to reduce potential exposure to
   flames and radiant heat. Homes built in pine forests should have a
   minimum safety zone of 100 feet. If your home sits on a steep slope,
   standard protective measures may not suffice. Contact your local fire
   department or forestry office for additional information.
     * Rake leaves, dead limbs and twigs. Clear all flammable vegetation.
     * Remove leaves and rubbish from under structures.
     * Thin a 15-foot space between tree crowns, and remove limbs within
       15 feet of the ground.
     * Remove dead branches that extend over the roof.
     * Prune tree branches and shrubs within 15 feet of a stovepipe or
       chimney outlet.
     * Ask the power company to clear branches from powerlines.
     * Remove vines from the walls of the home.
     * Mow grass regularly.
     * Clear a 10-foot area around propane tanks and the barbecue. Place a
       screen over the grill - use nonflammable material with mesh no
       coarser than one-quarter inch.
     * Regularly dispose of newspapers and rubbish at an approved site.
       Follow local burning regulations.
     * Place stove, fireplace and grill ashes in a metal bucket, soak in
       water for 2 days; then bury the cold ashes in mineral soil.
     * Store gasoline, oily rags and other flammable materials in approved
       safety cans. Place cans in a safe location away from the base of
       buildings.
     * Stack firewood at least 100 feet away and uphill from your home.
       Clear combustible material within 20 feet. Use only wood-burning
       devices evaluated by a nationally recognized laboratory.
     * Review your homeowner's insurance policy and also prepare/update a
       list of your home's contents.

Protect your home

     * Regularly clean roof and gutters.
     * Inspect chimneys at least twice a year. Clean them at least once a
       year. Keep the dampers in good working order. Equip chimneys and
       stovepipes with a spark arrester that meets the requirements of
       National Fire Protection Association Standard 211. (Contact your
       local fire department for exact specifications.)
     * Use 1/8-inch mesh screen beneath porches, decks, floor areas, and
       the home itself. Also, screen openings to floors, roof and attic.
     * Install a dual-sensor smoke alarm on each level of your home,
       especially near bedrooms; test monthly and change the batteries at
       least once each year.
     * Teach each family member how to use a fire extinguisher (ABC type)
       and show them where it's kept.
     * Keep handy household items that can be used as fire tools: a rake,
       axe, handsaw or chain saw, bucket and shovel.
     * Keep a ladder that will reach the roof.
     * Consider installing protective shutters or heavy fire-resistant
       drapes.

Plan your water needs

     * Identify and maintain an adequate outside water source such as a
       small pond, cistern, well, swimming pool, or hydrant.
     * Have a garden hose that is long enough to reach any area of the
       home and other structures on the property.
     * Install freeze-proof exterior water outlets on at least two sides
       of the home and near other structures on the property. Install
       additional outlets at least 50 feet from the home.
     * Consider obtaining a portable gasoline powered pump in case
       electrical power is cut off.

When Wildfire Threatens

   If you are warned that a wildfire is threatening your area, listen to
   your battery-operated radio for reports and evacuation information.
   Follow the instructions of local officials.
     * Back your car into the garage or park it in an open space facing
       the direction of escape. Shut doors and roll up windows. Leave the
       key in the ignition. Close garage windows and doors, but leave them
       unlocked. Disconnect automatic garage door openers.
     * Confine pets to one room. Make plans to care for your pets in case
       you must evacuate.
     * Arrange temporary housing at a friend or relative's home outside
       the threatened area.

If advised to evacuate, do so immediately

     * Wear protective clothing - sturdy shoes, cotton or woolen clothing,
       long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, gloves, and a handkerchief to
       protect your face.
     * Take your Disaster Supplies Kit.
     * Lock your home.
     * Tell someone when you left and where you are going.
     * Choose a route away from fire hazards. Watch for changes in the
       speed and direction of fire and smoke.

If you're sure you have time, take steps to protect your home

   Inside:
     * Close windows, vents, doors, blinds, or noncombustible window
       coverings and heavy drapes. Remove lightweight curtains.
     * Shut off all utilities if possible, including bottled gas.
     * Open fireplace damper. Close fireplace screens.
     * Move flammable furniture into the center of the home away from
       windows and sliding glass doors.
     * Turn on a light in each room to increase the visibility of your
       home in heavy smoke.

   Outside:
     * Seal attic and ground vents with precut noncombustible coverings.
     * Turn off propane tanks.
     * Place combustible patio furniture inside.
     * Connect the garden hose to outside taps.
     * Set up a portable gasoline-powered pump.
     * Place lawn sprinklers on the roof and near aboveground fuel tanks.
       Wetting the roof may help if it is shake-shingled.
     * Wet or remove shrubs within 15 feet of the home.
     * Gather fire tools.

Emergency Supplies

   When wildfire threatens, you won't have time to shop or search for
   supplies. Assemble a Disaster Supplies Kit with items you may need if
   advised to evacuate. Store these supplies in sturdy, easy-to-carry
   containers such as backpacks, duffle bags, or trash containers.

   Include:
     * A three-day supply of water (one gallon per person per day) and
       food that won't spoil.
     * One change of clothing and footwear per person and one blanket or
       sleeping bag per person.
     * A first aid kit that includes your family's prescription
       medications.
     * Emergency tools including a battery-powered radio, flashlight, and
       plenty of extra batteries.
     * An extra set of car keys and a credit card, cash, or traveler's
       checks.
     * Sanitation supplies.
     * Special items for infant, elderly, or disabled family members.
     * An extra pair of eye-glasses.
     * Keep important family documents in a waterproof container. Assemble
       a smaller version of your kit to keep in the trunk of your car.

Create a Family Disaster Plan

   Wildfire and other types of disasters - hurricane, flood, tornado,
   earthquake, hazardous materials spill, winter storm - can strike
   quickly and without warning. You can cope with disaster by preparing in
   advance and working together. Meet with your family to create a
   disaster plan. To get started:

Contact your local Emergency Management Agency or your local American Red
Cross chapter

     * Find out about the hazards in your community.
     * Ask how you would be warned.
     * Find out how to prepare for each type of disaster.

Meet with your family

     * Discuss the types of disasters that could occur.
     * Explain how to prepare and respond to each type of disaster.
     * Discuss where to go and what to bring if advised to evacuate.
     * Practice what you have discussed.

Plan how your family will stay in contact if separated by disaster

     * Pick two meeting places:
         1. a place a safe distance from your home in case of a home fire.
         2. a place outside your neighborhood in case you can't return
            home.
     * Choose an out-of-state friend as a "check-in contact" for everyone
       to call.

Complete these steps

     * Post emergency telephone numbers by every phone.
     * Show responsible family members how and when to shut off water,
       gas, and electricity at main switches.
     * Contact your local fire department to learn about home fire
       hazards.
     * Learn first aid and CPR. Contact your local American Red Cross
       chapter for information and training.

Practice and review these steps!
