Assessment of garment factories to begin, to ensure building, fire and
electrical safety

Garment industry stakeholders agree need for common safety standards.

   Press release | 07 September 2013
   DHAKA (ILO News) - The adoption of common safety standards in
   Bangladesh's ready-made garment factories has come a step closer,
   following a meeting of national tripartite partners, the Alliance and
   Accord and other key stakeholders in the industry.
   The workshop, convened by the Ministry of Labour and Employment,
   Government of Bangladesh, and the International Labour Organization,
   brought together all key national and international stakeholders from
   the RMG sector, representatives from different ministries and agencies,
   employers' and workers' groups and technical specialists on building
   and fire safety.
   Participants attending the workshop at the Hotel Pan Pacific Sonargaon,
   Dhaka, agreed the need for a uniform approach to the setting of common
   fire, electrical and building safety assessment standards in the
   readymade garment industry (RMG).
   Secretary of the Ministry of Labour, Mikail Shipar, said this was
   critical because the assessments would be carried out by different
   initiatives.
   "We welcome the commitment made by the Accord and the Alliance to
   coordinate the development of the standards to be used for the
   assessments. The Tripartite Committee will, with the assistance of the
   ILO and in consultation with the Accord and the Alliance, organize the
   activities required to realize such coordination," the Labour Secretary
   said.
   It follows the Rana Plaza building collapse tragedy in April, in which
   1,132 people died and more than one thousand workers were injured.
   Several national and international commitments and initiatives resulted
   from the tragedy - all aimed at improving safety in Bangladesh's
   garment factories.
   These include the [31]Accord on Fire and Building Safety, the Alliance
   for Bangladesh Worker Safety and the Compact on improving working
   conditions and promoting the application of international labour
   standards, issued by the European Union, Governments of Bangladesh and
   the United States and the ILO.
   A [32]National Tripartite Plan of Action on Fire safety and Structural
   Integrity has been signed and is the basis for initiating assessments
   in garment factories.
   ILO Country Director, Srinivas Reddy, stressed that it will be vital
   for all parties to work together.
   "It is necessary to agree on a coordinated approach towards safety
   standards and assessment and inspection methodologies to avoid the
   duplication of inspections of the same factories and to ensure that
   the same basic standards are applied."
   Assessments of factories not covered by the Alliance and the Accord
   will begin towards the end of September and will be carried out by the
   30 engineering teams led by Bangladesh University of Engineering and
   Technology (BUET) and nine other technical universities, under the
   supervision of the National Tripartite Committee.
   The Labour Secretary urged the Alliance and the Accord to share their
   list of factories so that duplication can be avoided and the national
   effort can begin without further delay.
