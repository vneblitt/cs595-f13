                           Protecting Our Communities

      "When a new mayor, Cory Booker, got elected he did something very
     bold. What he did was that he promised to prioritize public safety.
      He promised the people of Newark that he would make the city safe
      and he staked his personal reputation and credibility on doing so.
      What is unbelievable, and truly what I would consider a miracle of
     government, is that today we sit here and Newark is a safer city. By
      all accounts Newark now leads our country in reductions in violent
                                   crime."

               -Former New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram
                               October 25, 2010

   My time as Mayor has taught me that we will never arrest our way out of
   New Jersey's crime problem.

   There will be a ceiling to our progress as long as economic opportunity
   is scarce, poverty is abundant, quality public education elusive,
   illegal guns are readily available, drug laws and enforcement
   priorities remain misguided, our justice system and prisons continue to
   put the warehousing of human potential before rehabilitation, and we as
   a society fail to treat crime as the multi-dimensional societal ill
   that it truly is.

   The story of our crime fighting efforts in Newark has been one of
   constantly pushing against this ceiling.

   Yes, we have driven down murders, rape, aggravated assault, theft, auto
   theft, and shootings, even when taking into account more recent spikes
   in crime. In 2010 Newark went a full calendar month without a murder
   for the first time since 1966, and saw 43 days without a murder in
   2008, which was the longest such stretch since 1961.

   But it is hard to take any bit of comfort in that progress when one
   homicide is one too many, and when there are still so many mothers
   grieving over lost children. It is even more difficult when you know
   that common-sense reforms to federal gun laws, smarter and more robust
   investment in education and anti-poverty programs, and a justice system
   that doesn't produce three-year recidivism rates of over 50 percent in
   New Jersey, may have prevented the tragedies we see everyday.

   As your Senator, these will be some of my priorities to help protect
   our communities:

Passing Common Sense Gun Safety Legislation

   It is plainly unacceptable that we don't have background checks for
   every gun sale in America, as well as bans on high capacity magazines
   and assault weapons that have no practical sporting use, and countless
   other reforms that will save lives.

   As Mayor, I did all I could to fight against gun violence:
     * I was deeply involved with Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition
       of mayors dedicated to bringing sanity to our gun laws;
     * I focused my police department's efforts and resources on gun
       crime;
     * I attracted private philanthropy to invest in cutting edge
       technology like an acoustic gunshot detection system;
     * I even travelled to Washington DC to personally appeal to the
       acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and
       Explosives for law enforcement access to crime gun trace data so
       that my department, and departments across New Jersey, could do
       more to understand and battle against gun trafficking.

   But now I know that to better protect Newark, other New Jersey cities,
   and our suburbs and rural areas (which are experiencing more and more
   gun violence), the fight is in Congress.

   Congress had the chance to get this right in the wake of Newtown. If
   elected to the Senate, I will start work on common sense gun reform on
   day one.

Reforming the Criminal Justice System

   Our criminal justice system is broken. New Jersey's prison population
   increased by 328% between 1980 and 2011, burdening taxpayers with
   billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs, and destabilizing
   countless families and communities. And that incarceration isn't
   working: 55% of those who go to state prison are rearrested within
   three years.

   In Newark, we didn't wait for the state or federal government to get
   their act together:
     * We launched ex-offender reentry programs that drove down recidivism
       rates;
     * We created a youth court, community court, and veterans court - the
       community court and veterans court are the first of their kind in
       the state, designed to connect low level offenders with specialized
       resources to reduce recidivism and better protect our
       neighborhoods.
     * We expanded mentoring programs, youth programing, recreation
       spaces, and youth employment opportunities to engage our kids in
       constructive activities that lead to productive pathways, not
       prison.

   We must do more to fix our cycle of arrest and re-arrest, and invest in
   money-saving, human potential saving, reforms.

Putting more first responders on our streets

   As an executive serving during the deepest economic downturn this
   nation has endured in generations, I did all I could to protect the
   ranks of my fire and police departments, and funding for emergency
   medical services.

   But it wasn't enough. Like most localities in New Jersey, and like so
   many across the country, we watched our ranks dwindle even as we
   searched for new revenue and cut everywhere else first.

   I witnessed firsthand the importance of federal support for local
   emergency services, and as your Senator will work to better fund
   Assistance to Firefighters (AFG) grants, Staffing for Adequate Fire and
   Emergency Response (SAFER) grants, Community Oriented Policing Services
   (COPS) grants, and do all I can to support the first responders who
   protect us.
