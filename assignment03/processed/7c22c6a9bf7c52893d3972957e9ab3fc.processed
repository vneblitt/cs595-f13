   The World Bank, headquartered a block from the White House, was founded
   after World War II to combat global poverty. But over the past year,
   fighting climate change has become the bank's new guiding principle, as
   economic evidence indicates that global warming will be a driving cause
   of poverty worldwide in the 21st century. The bank has become a big
   player in climate policy, investing billions annually into
   climate-related programs--and blocking money from projects such as
   coal-fired power plants. In a November report, the bank detailed the
   devastating economic consequences of a global annual temperature
   increase of 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100. In a
   June study, the bank projected that due to climate change, by the 2030s
   African countries could lose up 80 percent of cropland and major
   portions of Bangkok and Vietnam could be flooded. National Journal
   spoke with Rachel Kyte, the bank's vice president of sustainable
   development, about the economic impact of climate change.

   NJ: Why is the World Bank now putting so much emphasis on climate
   change?

   Kyte: We've come to the realization that we cannot achieve our mission,
   which is to end poverty, unless we slow the rate of climate change.
   Climate science now shows that we're on course for a 4-degree [Celsius]
   temperature rise by 2100, that we're going to be 2 degrees warmer by
   the 2030s. And that's going to have devastating effects on food
   production, how livable cities are.... It's going to be extraordinarily
   difficult for the poor, who are the least resilient, to be part of the
   growth and opportunity story over the next few decades if climate
   change is unabated.

   NJ: So climate change is now a driving force of the World Bank's
   mission?

   Kyte: Absolutely. There are countries in Africa experiencing drought
   every two years as opposed to every five, or every 10 years. If the
   economic impact of a crippling drought is 1, 2, or 3 percentage points
   of GDP lost in a year and this is happening every two years, these
   countries are going backwards rather than forwards. Climate change is
   absolutely central to our understanding of how we can help these
   countries grow and prosper.

   NJ: How does a financial-development institution do that?

   Kyte: It's a good question. We work with governments and the private
   sector ... to understand their aspirations around growth and
   competitiveness. We need to help them factor in the risks that they
   will face as a result of the climate impacts that can be
   predicted--increase of extreme weather events, sea-level rise,
   crop-production dislocation. We need to walk them through the risks of
   climate change and the need to invest in their own resilience and in
   low-carbon developments.... We need to walk them through the
   opportunities that come from avoiding the lock-in of a carbon-intensive
   growth model. And we need to walk them through whether there are
   up-front capital costs ... and where those costs can be met with
   mobilization of different financial or investment resources.

   NJ: For the developed world, particularly the U.S., how do you make the
   case that there's an economic cost to climate change?

   Kyte: The extreme weather events that we are experiencing globally ...
   bring enormous costs. The succession of storm events, droughts, the
   cycle of fires ... have enormous economic dislocation. Beyond just the
   extreme weather events, in which insurance costs can be calculated,
   there are costs in not planning to accommodate the increased intensity
   and frequency of some of these events. One superstorm is one thing, but
   if you now expect the superstorm to hit on a more intensive or more
   regular basis, not planning for that is an economic folly.

   NJ: In his climate-change speech in June, President Obama called for an
   end, globally, to public investment in coal-fired power plants, the
   world's chief contributor to climate-change emissions--a goal the World
   Bank has indicated that it will support. But in many developing
   economies, coal offers the cheapest--and sometimes only--way for poor
   populations to gain access to electricity. How do you justify this?

   Kyte: The way we square this circle is that we want sustainable energy
   for all. We want to close the energy access gap by 2030 ... but we
   would like the energy mix to become significantly greener over the same
   time period. There are 1.2 billion people who don't have access to
   energy today. They are mostly living in poor countries.... Extending
   energy to them, even if we did so with traditional fossil fuels, would
   only account for less than 1 percent of global emissions. Getting
   energy access is critically important. Economies don't grow, people
   can't run businesses, people can't get jobs unless there's energy. So
   we have to provide that. But at the same time, the burden of action in
   terms of making the energy system cleaner lies with countries that are
   fully developed.... The very poor, they should get access. They should
   get affordable energy. We'd like it to be clean, but we don't think we
   can balance the books on the back of the poor. And in middle-income and
   fast-growing and in developed countries ... it's about efficiency and a
   transition towards a cleaner energy mix.

   NJ: The U.S. is the largest historic climate-change polluter, although
   President Obama has said he'd now like to make the U.S. a leader in
   addressing climate change--starting with new regulations on carbon
   pollution from power plants. How is the U.S. doing as a leader on
   climate?

   Kyte: The short answer is that nobody's doing well enough. We're on
   track for 4 degrees [global average Celsius temperature rise] by 2100
   which is well over where we said as a global community we wanted to
   be..... If you're concerned about your children's health, your own
   health, your grandchildren's health, if you're concerned about the job
   your child's going to get, if you're concerned about where your
   grandchildren are going to live--this is front of mind. We all agree,
   whichever way we vote, whichever church, synagogue or mosque we pray
   in, or if we don't pray at all--we want the next generation to be
   better off than the current generation. The science is showing us that
   we are putting that in jeopardy every day we don't make decisions about
   clean energy.... The problem is that people imagine this is a world
   where we have to wear sackcloth, where there's no joy or opportunity.
   We don't think that's true.... We think it's perfectly possible, and
   we've produced the economic evidence to support it, to grow greener,
   and that there will be jobs, economic opportunity, and stability and
   safety if we do so.

   NJ: There's a lot of debate in the U.S. about the economic costs of
   climate policy. In particular, Republicans and the coal industry argue
   that regulations on coal plants or a carbon price will hurt the economy
   and the coal industry in particular, raising energy prices and costing
   jobs in coal country.

   Kyte: There is always a fear that environmental regulation drives down
   competitiveness, slows growth, and gets rid of jobs. In fact,
   environmental regulation poises countries towards continued
   competitiveness. Technically it is true, you need to make short-term
   decisions for long-term gain. There may be some short-term disruption
   in certain industries and certain parts of the economy. But there will
   be long-run opportunities elsewhere.... That's difficult to manage
   politically, but economically, that can be demonstrated.

   Finally, if carbon is the problem, which it is ... then we should be
   putting a price on something which is bad. And if we put a price on it,
   one has to wonder, within the economy, how much you want to have an
   exposure to a commodity which is going to have a significant price to
   it at some point in the near- to medium-term future. You don't have to
   believe economic theory for that. You have to look at how some major
   corporations around the world, including U.S. corporations, are
   factoring into their strategic planning a possible price on carbon and
   making decisions about how exposed they want to be to carbon-intensive
   industry.

   NJ: What about the role of China, which is the largest current carbon
   polluter, and also a growing, developing economy, hoping to lift
   millions of citizens out of poverty?

   Kyte: The new Chinese leadership ... is extremely focused on this.
   That's been revealed in the bilateral dialogue in the U.S. and in our
   conversations with them. They are working to understand the path of
   urbanization and the impact that has on emissions. They have a large
   population which they want to see prosper and grow. And they are moving
   away from their dependence on fossil fuels. They also have significant
   water scarcity. They have an extraordinarily complex situation with
   which to deal. But changing the path of growth to make it lower-carbon
   is central to the last [Chinese national] five-year plan.... Don't
   forget, they are piloting a domestic carbon-trading system with the
   commitment to having a national system. That's an aggressive move by
   them to try to find market-based mechanisms to drill carbon-efficiency
   through their economy.

   NJ: Anything else you'd like to add?

   Kyte: There isn't a situation where one end of the boat goes up and the
   other end goes down. We're all in this boat together. Climate change is
   a leveler. If we don't deal with it as an economic issue, it will get
   the best of us. The impacts of climate change are not partisan. They
   will hit you if you're in Staten Island or in Battery Park, and they'll
   continue to hit you, again and again and again. I don't think that has
   been fully understood in every developed country, and the sooner we
   grasp that, the better.
