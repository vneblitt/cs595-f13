   What a Week for Women‚s Health in Virginia

   Women‚s health took center stage in the Virginia governor‚s race this
   week ‚ which means it‚s been a bad week for Ken Cuccinelli.

   Here‚s a recap of all that happened this week:

   On Monday (Women‚s Equality Day):

   Women‚s health supporters from Charlottesville and Albemarle County
   spoke out against Ken Cuccinelli‚s extreme and dangerous record and
   agenda for women‚s health.

   Among them was Charlotte Brody, a registered nurse, who denounced
   Cuccinelli‚s history of interfering in the personal and private
   decisions of Virginians ‚ from our bedrooms to our exam rooms
   ‚¬ [21]saying, ‚I don‚t want Ken Cuccinelli deciding what I should do
   with my life, what my kids should do with their lives. That‚s personal,
   that‚s private, and I‚ll keep those decisions for myself.‚

   Cuccinelli‚s response? In a desperate attempt to avoid talking about
   his own extreme record and agenda for women‚s health, Cuccinelli dodged
   the question and asks why Democrats haven‚t denounced [22]Anthony
   Weiner.

   On Tuesday:

   Ken Cuccinelli [23]claimed he doesn't ‚think government should be doing
   anything about birth control or birth control devices‚ and that ‚[he‚s]
   never supported legislation that invades people‚s choices about
   contraception.‚¬ Even though he introduced extreme and dangerous
   so-called ‚personhood‚ legislation which, if enacted, could interfere
   with personal, private, medical decisions relating to birth control,
   access to fertility treatment, management of a miscarriage, and access
   to safe and legal abortion.

   On Wednesday:

   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe joined Planned
   Parenthood Virginia PAC Executive Director Cianti Stewart-Reid and
   former Virginia Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Remley at Women‚s Health
   Forum in Virginia Beach ‚ talking with Virginia women about the issues
   that matter to them.

   At the event, [24]McAuliffe said that as Virginia‚s next governor, ‚I
   will be a brick wall standing there firm to make sure that no bill gets
   out of the General Assembly that could impede or hurt a woman‚s right
   to make her own personal health decisions,‚ continuing to make the
   choice for women‚s health even clearer this election.

   On Thursday:

   Planned Parenthood Votes and Planned Parenthood Virginia PAC
   [25]announced grassroots voter outreach efforts, with a new web ad, to
   help keep Ken out of the governor‚s mansion by spreading the word to
   Virginia voters on his extreme and dangerous women‚s health agenda.

   Women‚s health supporters and volunteers plan to knock thousands of
   doors over the following months because Virginia women cannot risk Ken
   Cuccinelli as governor.

   On Friday:

   We‚re still reveling in the audacity of Ken Cuccinelli trying to run
   from his record, but we‚re not going to sit silently by. Today we‚re
   telling Ken Cuccinelli: we know your record on women‚s health and
   you‚re going to have to run on it. [26]Sign the petition and join us in
   telling Ken, ‚We‚re not fooled.‚
