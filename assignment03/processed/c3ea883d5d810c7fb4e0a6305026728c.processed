Virginia Tech among three universities to receive grant to launch National
Innovation Network Regional Node

   BLACKSBURG, Va., Feb. 22, 2013 - Three top universities in the
   Mid-Atlantic region are teaming to tackle an enduring challenge: how to
   translate $60 billion in research funding into new products and
   companies that benefit society.

   Yesterday, the University of Maryland, George Washington University,
   and Virginia Tech jointly announce they are teaming through $3.75
   million in funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to launch
   a regional Innovation Corps (I-Corps) node with one sweeping goal: find
   the best entrepreneurial student and faculty researchers and help them
   bring their discoveries to market.

   I-Corps takes researchers through a seven-week program based upon
   Stanford University's [160]Lean LaunchPad course, with additional
   elements designed just for I-Corps participants. The program's
   methodology draws upon decades of experience in Silicon Valley,
   emphasizing talking to as many potential customers as possible,
   pivoting in response to resulting insights, building low-cost
   prototypes to get customer feedback, constantly adapting, and building
   a scalable business model.

   Successful outcomes for I-Corps include a new startup, patent or
   technology license to a company. The program will also foster a culture
   of entrepreneurship among researchers and students.

   The new Mid-Atlantic I-Corps node is one of three announced today by
   NSF, with additional nodes supported in California and New York,
   through a total of $11.2 million in funding. These add to existing
   I-Corps nodes at Georgia Tech and the University of Michigan.

   Collectively, these nodes create the foundation of NSF's plan to
   establish a National Innovation Network designed to propel research to
   market.

   "I-Corps is aggressive, methodical, and just what our region needs,"
   said [161]Dean Chang, associate vice president for innovation and
   entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, lead institution for
   this program. "We live in one of the most fertile areas in the country
   for technology-based research, and our goal is nothing short of finding
   300 of the most talented research teams and guiding them through the
   best technology commercialization program available."

   Through the new Mid-Atlantic I-Corps Node, NSF will select up to 50
   research teams from across the country each year and send them to the
   area to be guided through I-Corps. The Mid-Atlantic Node will also
   offer I-Corps annually to an additional 50 teams of its choosing. With
   up to 100 teams trained each year for three years, the total could
   reach 300.

   Trainings will be held for seven weeks, up to four times annually.

   "Becoming an I-Corp Node is the highest acknowledgement a region can
   receive from NSF and we are honored to have been selected along with
   the University of Maryland and Virginia Tech," said Jim Chung,
   executive director of the Office of Entrepreneurship and Technology
   Transfer for George Washington University. "It is essentially a
   technology development incubator for the top scientists and engineers
   in the U.S. That incubator is now available to researchers in the
   Mid-Atlantic."

   In addition to training up to 100 teams per year, the Mid-Atlantic
   I-Corps Node will establish a mentor development program to attract,
   train and retain top-notch mentors. It will also create a post-I-Corps
   support program to help teams with follow-on activities such as
   continued customer development, minimum viable product (MVP)
   prototyping, technology transfer and licensing, fundraising, legal
   services, and hiring executive talent.

   Partners will include FounderCorps, Springboard, ACTiVATE and the
   Maryland Intellectual Property Legal Resource Center.

   A new online network created by the Mid-Atlantic Node will tie tools
   and resources together, while follow-on studies will be conducted to
   measure the effectiveness of the program.

   Expanding into the Mid-Atlantic region could create a 'perfect storm'
   of the right program meeting a region rife with opportunities.

   "Thirty-five of the top 200 U.S. universities in research and
   development expenditures are located within a four-hour drive of this
   I-Corps partnership," said John "Jack" Lesko, associate dean for
   research and graduate studies in the College of Engineering at Virginia
   Tech. "Those universities collectively conducted $14.3 billion in
   research in 2010. We will attract and train teams from these top
   regional academic institutions, as well as from the many federal and
   state research labs unique to the region, including NASA, NIH and
   ARPA-E."

   The University of Maryland, George Washington University and Virginia
   Tech pull together a wide and experienced collection of resources and
   personnel to make the Mid-Atlantic I-Corps Node a success.
   Collectively, the three institutions have already taken nine teams
   through the national I-Corps program.

   The new regional node presents a unique opportunity for the NSF to
   leverage the respective strengths of the three institutions, galvanize
   them as one, and catalyze the region.

   "These new nodes will significantly expand our reach in bringing
   innovation education to faculty and students," said NSF Program
   Director Don Millard. "The three consortia, with different and distinct
   industries in their region, are excited about the impact they will
   have, on and beyond their campuses. The addition of these nodes will
   significantly help advance the I-Corps program's National Innovation
   Network."

   "The Nodes are the foundation of a national innovation ecosystem and
   focus on the front-lines of local and regional commercialization
   efforts," said Errol Arkilic NSF I-Corps program director. "We are
   looking to them to provide long-term, critical education infrastructure
   and feedback to the programs that support the commercialization of our
   nation's basic research portfolio."

   "Over the decades, NSF-funded researchers have made a massive
   contribution to domestic economic growth," said Congressman Dan
   Lipinski (D-IL), a proponent of the I-Corps program. "But given the
   size of the federal investment in research--$60 billion annually--the
   American people should be getting even more new companies and jobs for
   their money. I-Corps represents a low-cost way to get us across the
   much-discussed 'Valley of Death' that separates laboratory discoveries
   from profit-making companies that boost economic growth and American
   competitiveness."

   The [162]College of Engineering at Virginia Tech is internationally
   recognized for its excellence in 14 engineering disciplines and
   computer science. The college's 6,000 undergraduates benefit from an
   innovative curriculum that provides a "hands-on, minds-on" approach to
   engineering education, complementing classroom instruction with two
   unique design-and-build facilities and a strong Cooperative Education
   Program. With more than 50 research centers and numerous laboratories,
   the college offers its 2,000 graduate students opportunities in
   advanced fields of study such as biomedical engineering,
   state-of-the-art microelectronics, and nanotechnology. Virginia Tech,
   the most comprehensive university in Virginia, is dedicated to quality,
   innovation, and results to the commonwealth, the nation, and the world.
