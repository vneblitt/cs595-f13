   We love what we see on Instagram, and we think there's potential for
   something deeper. Something more communal. So today we're starting
   something new with our friends at KPCC in Los Angeles: A collective
   storytelling project called Public Square. Follow us! @[23]npr +
   @[24]kpcc

   Each month will have a theme and hashtag. We'll ask you to share a
   glimpse of your life â but beyond that, to tell us stories.

   First Assignment: Hard Work (#PSHardWork)

   It's a dirty job, but, as they say, someone's gotta do it. Strike up a
   conversation with the person at the dry cleaner, the airline steward,
   the cab driver, the person who edits your writing â or fixes your
   company computers.

   Take their portrait, get all the info â name, age, story â put it all
   in the caption, and tag it #[25]PSHardWork

   How Public Square Differs:

   We're public media, and storytelling is in our DNA. For this project,
   we want more than just a pretty photo. Your words are equally
   important.

   Ground Rules:

   Please tag only one photo with #PSHardWork on Instagram between now and
   Monday, Aug. 19.

   Any image tagged before that date is eligible to be featured on
   Instagram, KPCC's [26]AudioVision and NPR's [27]Picture Show.

   Make connections, share your stories, and have fun.
