   Staff report

   8:13 p.m. CDT, September 13, 2013

   Chicago Police searching the South Branch of the Chicago River near the
   South Loop this evening after a woman was spotted jumping into the
   water found a woman's body.

   A Fire Department diver had to avoid dangerous debris while searching
   for the woman, who was believed to have jumped from the Roosevelt Road
   Bridge, 300 W. Roosevelt Road, around 2:40 p.m., authorities said. A
   woman's body was found in the river about 6:45 p.m., said Chicago
   Police News Affairs Officer Veejay Zala.

   The Fire Department diver searched in an area where the woman was
   believed to have been last seen, just south of the bridge, according to
   the Chicago Fire Department's media office.

   About 4:20 p.m., the Fire Department turned the search over to police,
   with the presumption that authorities were now searching for the
   woman's body rather than making a rescue effort, according to the Fire
   Department. Police used sonar equipment to look for her body.
