1st Anniversary of the Birth Control Benefit Cuccinelli Suggested We ‚Go to

   Today marks the one year anniversary since the Affordable Care Act‚s
   birth control benefit went into effect ‚ ensuring that all women have
   access to affordable birth control with no co-pay, no matter who their
   boss is.

   Expanding access to birth control with no co-pay can save women and
   families up to¬ $600 dollars¬ a year. It‚s no wonder a majority of
   Americans [24](70 percent) believe insurance companies should cover
   birth control without co-pay, but that hasn‚t stopped some politicians
   like Ken Cuccinelli from trying to chip away at women‚s access.
   Cuccinelli has called the birth control benefit a ‚sterilization
   mandate‚ and an example of tyranny ‚ even suggesting people should be
   willing to ‚go to jail‚ to fight it.

   It‚s no surprise that Ken Cuccinelli fails to recognize the health and
   economic benefits Virginia women and families see as a result of better
   access to birth control. Cuccinelli has shown throughout his entire
   career just how out-of-touch he is.

   As a senator, he voted ‚ twice ‚ against legislation clarifying that
   birth control was not a form of abortion, and he co-sponsored so called
   ‚personhood‚ legislation that if enacted could block access to some
   forms of birth control.

   Virginia cannot afford to move backward on women‚s health and economic
   security ‚ especially when it comes to something as basic as better
   access to birth control. Ken Cuccinelli has spent a career trying to
   turn back the clock on women‚s health, and Virginia must keep him out
   of office to continue to move Virginia and women‚s health forward.
