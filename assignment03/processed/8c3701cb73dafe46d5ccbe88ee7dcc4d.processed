Virginia Tech researchers unveil large robotic jellyfish that one day could
patrol oceans

   Student research team behind robotic jellyfish Left to right, robotic
   jellyfish research team members Alex Villanueva of St-Jacques,
   New-Brunswick, Canada, and a doctoral student; and Kenneth Marut of
   Washington, D.C, and Tyler Michael of Lexington, N.C., both masters
   students, all in the mechanical engineering program.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., April 3, 2013 - Virginia Tech College of Engineering
   researchers have unveiled a life-like, autonomous robotic jellyfish the
   size and weight of a grown man, 5 foot 7 inches in length and weighing
   170 pounds, as part of a U.S. Navy-funded project.

   The prototype robot, nicknamed Cyro, is a larger model of a robotic
   jellyfish the same team - headed by [160]Shashank Priya of Blacksburg,
   Va., and professor of [161]mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech -
   unveiled in 2012. The earlier robot, [162]dubbed RoboJelly, is roughly
   the size of a man's hand, and typical of jellyfish found along beaches.

   "A larger vehicle will allow for more payload, longer duration, and
   longer range of operation," said Alex Villanueva of St-Jacques,
   New-Brunswick, Canada, and a doctoral student in mechanical engineering
   working under Priya. "Biological and engineering results show that
   larger vehicle have a lower cost of transport, which is a metric used
   to determine how much energy is spent for traveling."

   Both robots are part of a multi-university, nationwide $5 million
   project funded by U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Center and the Office of
   Naval Research. The goal is to place self-powering, autonomous machines
   in waters for the purposes of surveillance and monitoring the
   environment, in addition to other uses such as studying aquatic life,
   mapping ocean floors, and monitoring ocean currents.

   Jellyfish are attractive candidates to mimic because of their ability
   to consume little energy owing to a lower metabolic rate than other
   marine species. Additionally, they appear in wide variety of sizes,
   shapes and colors, allowing for several designs.

   They also inhabit every major oceanic area of the world and are capable
   of withstanding a wide range of temperatures in both fresh and salt
   waters. Most species are found in shallow coastal waters, but some have
   been found in depths 7,000 meters below sea level.

   Partner universities in the project are Providence College in Rhode
   Island, the University of California Los Angeles, the University of
   Texas at Dallas, and Stanford University. Priya's team is building the
   jellyfish body models, integrating fluid mechanics and developing
   control systems.

   Cyro is modeled and named after the jellyfish cyanea capillata, Latin
   for "lion's mane jellyfish," with "Cyro" derived from "cyanea" and
   "robot." As with its predecessor, this robot is in the prototype stage,
   years away from use in waters. A new prototype model already is under
   construction at Virginia Tech's Durham Hall, where Priya's [165]Center
   for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems is based.

   "We hope to improve on this robot and reduce power consumption and
   improve swimming performance as well as better mimic the morphology of
   the natural jellyfish," Villanueva said, adding that the project also
   allows researchers such as himself to better understand aquatic
   creatures live. "Our hopes for Cyro's future is that it will help
   understand how the propulsion mechanism of such animal scales with
   size."

   A stark difference exists between the larger and smaller robots. Cyro
   is powered by a rechargeable nickel metal hydride battery, whereas the
   smaller models were tethered, Priya said. Experiments have also been
   conducted on powering jellyfish with hydrogen but there is still much
   research to be done in that area.

   In both cases, the jellyfish must operate on their own for months or
   longer at a time as engineers likely won't be able to capture and
   repair the robots, or replace power sources.

   "Cyro showed its ability to swim autonomously while maintaining a
   similar physical appearance and kinematics as the natural species,"
   Priya said, adding that the robot is simultaneously able to collect,
   store, analyze, and communicate sensory data. This autonomous operation
   in shallow water conditions is already a big step towards demonstrating
   the use of these creatures."

   The robot can maneuver in water by a rigid support structure with
   direct current electric motors which control the mechanical arms that
   are used in conjunction with an artificial mesoglea, or jelly-based
   pulp of the fish's body, creating hydrodynamic movement.

   With no central nervous system, jellyfish instead use a diffused nerve
   net to control movement and can complete complex functions. A parallel
   study on a bio-inspired control system is in progress which will
   eventually replace the current simplified controller.

   As with the smaller models, Cyro's skin is comprised of a thick layer
   of silicone, squishy in one's hand. It mimics the sleek jellyfish skin
   and is placed over a bowl-shaped device containing the electronic guts
   of the robot. When moving, the skin floats and moves with the robot,
   looking weirdly alive.

   "It has been a great experience to finally realize the biomimetic and
   bio-inspired robotic vehicles," Priya said. "Nature has too many
   secrets and we were able to find some of them but many still remain. We
   hope to find a mechanism to continue on this journey and resolve the
   remaining puzzles."

   The [166]College of Engineering at Virginia Tech is internationally
   recognized for its excellence in 14 engineering disciplines and
   computer science. The college's 6,000 undergraduates benefit from an
   innovative curriculum that provides a "hands-on, minds-on" approach to
   engineering education, complementing classroom instruction with two
   unique design-and-build facilities and a strong Cooperative Education
   Program. With more than 50 research centers and numerous laboratories,
   the college offers its 2,000 graduate students opportunities in
   advanced fields of study such as biomedical engineering,
   state-of-the-art microelectronics, and nanotechnology. Virginia Tech,
   the most comprehensive university in Virginia, is dedicated to quality,
   innovation, and results to the commonwealth, the nation, and the world.

   Virginia Tech College of Engineering researchers are working on a
   multi-university, nationwide project for the U.S. Navy that one day
   will put life-like autonomous robot jellyfish in waters around the
   world. The robotic creatures are called RoboJelly are being designed to
   operate on their own energy versus, say, sea crabs or mollusks.
