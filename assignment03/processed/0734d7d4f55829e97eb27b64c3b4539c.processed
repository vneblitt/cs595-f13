Welcoming the Class of '17

With convocation, freshmen begin their four-year journey

   Freshman residents of Greenough show their excitement as Harvard
   University welcomed students of the Class of 2017 to campus at this
   year's Freshman Convocation held in Sanders Theatre and Memorial
   Church.
   By Colin Manning, FAS Communications

   Before they began their academic lives at Harvard, the members of the
   Class of 2017 already experienced a taste of adversity, and
   demonstrated resiliency.

   In April, the manhunt for the second suspected Boston Marathon bomber
   forced the lockdown of Cambridge and surrounding communities, the
   closure of [83]Harvard University, and the [84]cancellation of Visitas,
   the Harvard tradition in which admitted freshmen arrive for their first
   exposure to campus life. Instead, Harvard College students and incoming
   freshmen connected through a "virtual Visitas" online.

   On Monday, Mother Nature forced the class to make a quick adjustment
   for another, newer Harvard tradition, Freshman Convocation. Because of
   the chance of strong thunderstorms, officials moved the convocation
   from outdoor Tercentenary Theatre into Memorial Church and Sanders
   Theatre.

   But challenges have a way of bringing members of a class closer
   together, which [85]President Drew Faust and the rest of the
   convocation speakers stressed is critical to success at Harvard.

   "The most important and powerful part of the next four years will be
   about being a part of this community and about being together," Faust
   said.

   She went on to tell the freshmen that every encounter at Harvard should
   be viewed as an opportunity.

   "One of the reasons Harvard has thrived for nearly 400 years is that
   this community has provided an environment in which individuals of
   talent, curiosity, and intellectual ambition have interacted,
   influenced, and taught one another in ways that could not have been
   scripted or predicted," she said. "We bring you here to create the
   conditions for serendipity."

   [86]Michael D. Smith, dean of the [87]Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
   also stressed the importance of making connections with people across
   the Harvard community.

   "Harvard isn't just a repository of history and knowledge, and you
   aren't here just to receive your quota of information. Harvard is a
   dynamic place -- a constantly evolving place -- because of its people,"
   said Smith, the John H. Finley Jr. Professor of Engineering and Applied
   Sciences.

   New [88]Harvard College interim Dean [89]Donald Pfister continued the
   theme of community building. He said that although the freshmen come
   from more than 60 countries and 49 states -- making the class "one of
   the most diverse groups ever assembled at Harvard" -- the students
   probably have more in common with their classmates than they realize.

   "In coming to this College, you have done more than enroll in a school.
   You have joined a community. Forming a real community from a wildly
   miscellaneous collection of strangers requires work, and a lot of
   thought," Pfister said. "Community, the sense of belonging and of
   sharing, will be fundamental to your life at Harvard."

   Dean of Freshmen Thomas Dingman opened the convocation, while the
   [90]Rev. Jonathan Walton, the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and
   Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church, delivered the invocation.

   In the student salutation, Erin D. Drake '14 recalled how what she
   believed would be her path as a freshman changed immediately once she
   experienced all that Harvard has to offer.

   "I was focused on what I want to do over the next four years, not who I
   wanted to be. Do what matters to you," Drake suggested. "The question
   for you is: What are you going to do with the privilege of going to
   Harvard College?"

   Students also heard from Harvard Alumni Association President
   [91]Catherine Gellert '93 and listened to performances by the Kuumba
   Singers, the Harvard University Band, and the Holden Choirs.

   Faust stressed that the connections and friendships made now and over
   the next four years will last a lifetime.

   "I can promise you, because I greeted the Class of 1963 on the steps of
   Widener Library during reunions back in May, you will still be
   important to each other -- maybe even more important to each other --
   50 years from now."
