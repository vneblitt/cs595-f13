Use a Rain Barrel to Save Money and Protect the Environment

   Some say when it rains, it pours, but regardless of your thoughts on
   precipitation, it can't be denied that rain is not only useful, but
   necessary for survival.

   Even if the rain forces your activities indoors, you can take advantage
   of it to save money on water costs and protect the environment at the
   same time.

   [56]Rain barrels, which have been popping up under gutter spouts across
   the country, are an environmentally-friendly, cheap and efficient way
   of collecting water that would otherwise be wasted as runoff to nearby
   streams, rivers, or storm drains.

   When used, the barrels provide a supply of free "soft water" - water
   that contains no chlorine, lime, or calcium - ideal for watering
   gardens, washing cars, or topping off pools, among other uses. They
   store and collect the water that gathers in your gutters, saving it for
   when you need to use it.

   During peak summer months, times of heat and possible drought, the EPA
   estimates that rain barrels could save the average homeowner about 1300
   gallons of water!

   Not only are rain barrels cost effective, they are also extremely
   environmentally-friendly. They help to filter runoff rain water, which
   often carries pollutants to bodies of water, save energy by decreasing
   the demand for treated tap water, and help to protect the environment.
   Not to mention, they allow people to take advantage of a natural
   resource in a safe, green way.

   Not sure where to find a rain barrel? Check your local hardware or
   garden supply stores, as many carry a pre-made product available for
   purchase.

   If you don't find one there, you can build your own, with a 55-gallon
   drum, a vinyl hose, PVC couplings, and a screen on top of the barrel to
   keep out debris or insects. For complete supplies and instructions,
   visit the [57]EPA's how-to PDF.

   Once you have your rain barrel, just place it directly under a rain
   gutter, and collect away!
