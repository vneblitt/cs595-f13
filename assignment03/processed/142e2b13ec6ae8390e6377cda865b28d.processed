Obama Has No 'Intention' To Strike Syria If Congress Says No

   From 'Morning Edition': White House adviser Tony Blinken talks with
   NPR's Steve Inskeep

   "The president of course has the authority to act" even if Congress
   does not support his plan for a military strike on Syria, White House
   deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken [30]told Morning Edition
   host Steve Inskeep earlier today.

   But Blinken also said of the president that it is "neither his desire
   nor his intention to use that authority absent Congress backing him."

   Blinken's reference to the president's intentions is getting attention
   because the question of [31]what happens if Congress says "no" has been
   much debated since Obama [32]asked lawmakers to give him the green
   light.

   On Wednesday, [33]as we wrote, the president said he did not ask
   Congress to authorize the use of force against Syrian President Bashar
   Assad's regime "as a symbolic gesture," but added that "I always
   reserve the right and responsibility to act on behalf of America's
   national security."

   Update at 10:35 a.m. ET. Obama Is Asked About Blinken's Comment:

   At a news conference now underway in St. Petersburg, Russia, a reporter
   just told the president that one of his advisers said today that it's
   "not your intention" to strike Syria if Congress opposes such action.

   "I don't think that's exactly what he said," Obama responds, as he
   again declines to give a yes-or-no answer about what he will do if
   Congress turns him down.

   Update at 10:22 a.m. ET. Will He Go Ahead If Congress Says No? Obama
   Doesn't Directly Answer:

   Asked [34]at a news conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, whether he
   still might order strikes against Syria even if Congress does not give
   him the green light, Obama says he knew it was "going to be a heavy
   lift" when he asked lawmakers for such authorization. Then Obama says
   it would "be a mistake for me to jump the gun and speculate" about what
   would happen if his request is rejected.

   Continuing on that subject, Obama adds that he didn't "put this before
   Congress just as a political ploy or as symbolism." But he does not
   give a flat yes-or-no in response to the question.
