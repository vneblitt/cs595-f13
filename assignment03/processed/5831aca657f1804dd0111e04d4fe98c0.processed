   [204]Official auction site for Sandi, Jesse Jackson, Jr. items

   Story Image

   Updated: September 17, 2013 9:56AM

   At the auction . . .

   It's a tour de fur auction starting Tuesday for former U.S. Rep. Jesse
   Jackson Jr. and his wife, Sandi, who are awaiting federal jail time.

   Db To wit: An auction preview of furs purchased by Sandi Jackson and
   paid for with campaign donations -- which earned her a year in prison
   -- went on the Internet on Monday.

   Db Fur lure: The Jackson's collection of fur coats, which ought to give
   the animal activist group PETA a conniption fit, is being offered by
   the Texas auction house of Gaston & Sheehan on behalf of the U.S.
   Marshals' office.

   Db Celeb items: The auction, which begins online Tuesday and lasts
   until Thursday, also includes nine pieces of framed Michael Jackson and
   Bruce Lee memorabilia belonging to Jesse Jackson Jr.

   Db Nice price: Sandi's red cashmere cape with black mink trim; brown
   cashmere cape with brown mink trim; sheared mink jacket with silver fox
   sleeves, and black sheared mink hooded parka, all from Beverly Hills
   furrier Edwards-Lowell and bought in a one-day shopping spree in
   November 2009, are up for grabs.

   Here are the prices Sandi originally paid for the furs:

   Db $1,500 for the black and red cape. Starting bid: $215.

   Db $1,200 for the parka. Starting bid: $260.

   Db $800 for the brown cashmere cape. Starting bid: $115.

   Db $1,500 for the black mink with silver fox sleeves. Starting bid:
   $260.

   Among Jesse's purchases up for auction is a guitar signed by Michael
   Jackson and Eddie Van Halen, which he purchased for $4,000, and eight
   other pieces of memorabilia.

   It is not known what happened to the elk heads.

   Pulling the plug . . .

   Getting dissed: Did you know that ABC's George Stephanopoulos was
   invited to interview President Bashar Assad in Syria last week -- only
   to have the interview abruptly canceled once he left the U.S.? Now you
   do.

   The three amigos . . .

   It's no secret that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vice
   President Joe Biden, who are old pals, are both eyeing the nation's top
   job in 2016.

   Db Soooooooo, Sneed hears, is Secretary of State John Kerry, who is
   hoping a successful job engineering the U.S. out of the Syrian debacle
   will steer him into the White House.

   Db The turn of the screw! Consider this comment made by veep Biden over
   the weekend in Iowa, the home of the nation's first presidential caucus
   -- where Biden made no mention of his good pal Hillary -- and referred
   to her successor, Kerry, as "one of the best secretaries of state so
   far in the history of the United States."

   Ouch.

   Will's way . . .

   A royal ranting: Prince William, the second in line to the British
   throne, was only obeying orders when he decided to leave the British
   military:

   Db Translation: Will's grandmother, England's Queen Elizabeth II, is
   the sovereign who is head of the armed services in Great Britain. "She
   now feels it is time for her grandson to start learning the ropes,"
   said a Sneed source. "Besides, it will keep him out of harm's way and
   give him a little extra time to spend with his new family."

   I spy . . .

   Da Bears' Robbie Gould and Jay Cutler stopped by Chicago Cut after the
   team's win Sunday, where they were applauded as they walked into the
   dining room. . . . Actress Michelle Pfeiffer, who is starring in the
   movie, "The Family," was in for dinner at Gibsons Steakhouse with her
   husband, David Kelley, on Sunday. . . . Former Chicago Cubs player
   Billy Williams, former White Sox coach Ozzie Guillen, former White Sox
   pitcher Steve Trout and the great Minnie Minoso had dinner Sunday at
   Gibsons . . . ditto singer Debbie Gibson.

   Sneedlings . . .

   Tuesday's birthdays: Phil Jackson, 68; Kyle Chandler, 48, and Nate
   Berkus, 42.
