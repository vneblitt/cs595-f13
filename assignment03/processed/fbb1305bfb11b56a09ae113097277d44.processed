   As an example blipfoto mails look like this to me:
  Subject: =?utf-8?Q?Blipfoto=20=2D=20Introducing=20the=20all=2Dnew=20Bli

   Clearly that's a UTF-8-encoded subject, and it needs to be decoded
   prior to display.

   Annoyingly calling convert on these will show a result like this:
   Subject: =?utf-8?Q?Blipfoto - Introducing the all-new Blipfoto newslett

   So we need to do two things:
     * Decode.
     * Remove the leading encoding charset and trailing "?="

 Subject: Re: [lumail] Mail subjects aren't decoded. (#66)

   (This from the mail notification I received on your comment.)

   I suspect here the issue is the terminal not matching ISO-8859-1 -
   since I don't set any character set / output encoding explicitly and
   all the mails I've tested are UTF-8 which matches my terminal.

   So there's two distinct steps we should have:
     * Decoding the header.
     * Encoding for display.

   I've only done the first.

   We should probably set the output explicitly UTF-8:

   [79]http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4703168/adding-unicode-utf8-char
   s-to-a-ncurses-display-in-c

   Then use iconv() and friends to convert to that prior to output.

   Ugh. I don't like character sets!

   Still not working :(
   You code assumes the RFC 2047 encoding starts at the beginning.
   Unfortunately, the encoding can start at any time. You can even have
   several encodings in the same header.
   The examples in [91]http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047 are telling.

   Reimplementing a complex thing like that seems a waste of time.
   Unfortunately, mimetic doesn't seem to handle RFC2047 :(

   A quick search shows that [92]http://www.vmime.org/ does.

   Ugh. Off the top of my head we either:
     * Jump ship away from mimetic entirely. (Hard. Annoying.)
     * Look at using an additional library for header-decoding. (Annoying
       too, but less so.)
     * Continue hacking up my almost-solution. Certainly handling the case
       of multiple repeats in a line, and starting in the middle wouldn't
       be hard. But it's probably not the solution to choose.

   I don't want to rely upon a library that is not packaged for Debian,
   but there are other MIME libraries out there, so I will have a look.

   vmime is in Debian.

   I think embedding a library is bad. Parsing is notably hard and prone
   to security bugs, which is problematic when libraries are embedded.

   The problem with hacking a solution is think mail clients are among the
   worst pieces of software ever written ... we're likely going to
   encounter every possible misinterpretation from the RFCs.
   Reimplementing hacks to handle all those cases one more time is a waste
   of time... and let's not forget the risks of getting it wrong and
   introducing vulnerabilities.

   Thanks for the correction on vmime. It looks like it is in squeeze/sid,
   but not stable. Which is where I looked. Which is a problem.

   Agreed on embedding a library, unless it is very stable/small/mature.

   I guess I'll need to look at using vmime for this purpose, then
   backporting for wheezy. Because I run stable on my mail-machines.

   Leave it with me.

   Proposed solution:
    1. Move to using vmime for header decoding. To solve this bug.
    2. Move to using vmime for header encoding to solve [116]#80 - We
       decode headers, but we don't encode them.
    3. Later look to see if we can rip out mimetic and use vmime for
       attachment retrieval/addition/body-content fetching.

   I will close this bug when 1. is complete. Leaving [117]#80 for the
   outgoing, and a future bug for mimetic removal if the first two parts
   work.

   Hi,

   I'm the author of GMime and I just happened to come across your recent
   blog post about rfc2047 header decoding (it was referenced from a
   recent notmuch mailing-list email that a friend just pointed me at).

   Solving this problem is fairly difficult as so many mail clients
   generate all manner of broken headers. I've spent years tweaking and
   rewriting the one in GMime to handle as many different cases as it
   does.

   Here's a short list of the problems you'll face:
    1. First off, there are technically 2 variations of header encoding
       formats specified by rfc2047 - one for phrases and one for
       unstructured text fields. They are very similar but you can't use
       the same rules for tokenizing them. I mention this because it seems
       that most MIME parsers miss this very subtle distinction and so, as
       you might imagine, do most MIME generators. Hell, most MIME
       generators probably never even heard of specifications to begin
       with it seems... which brings us to:
    2. There are so many variations of how MIME headers fail to be
       tokenizable according to the rules of rfc*822 and rfc2047. You'll
       encounter fun stuff such as:
       a) encoded-word tokens illegally being embedded in other word
       tokens
       b) encoded-word tokens containing illegal characters in them (such
       as spaces, line breaks, and more)
       c) multi-byte character sequences being split between multiple
       encoded-word tokens
       d) the payloads of encoded-word tokens being split up into multiple
       encoded-word tokens (IOW the encoder first base64 or qp-encoded the
       text and then decided it was too long to fit on a single line, and
       so split up the encoded payload and placed the resulting chunks in
       different encoded-word tokens with no regard for the idea that each
       encoded-word token is supposed to be able to be decoded
       independently of other encoded-word tokens)
       You can see some examples here:
       [141]https://git.gnome.org/browse/gmime/tree/tests/test-mime.c#n211
    3. Something that many MIME authors seem to miss is the fact that each
       encoded-word token is allowed to be in different character
       encodings (you might have one token in UTF-8, another in ISO-8859-1
       and yet another in koi8-r). Normally, this would be no big deal
       because you'd just decode each payload, then convert from the
       specified charset into UTF-8 via iconv() or something. However, due
       to the fun brokenness I mentioned above in 2c and 2d, this becomes
       more complicated...
       If that isn't enough to make you want to throw your hands up in the
       air and mutter some profanities, there's more...
    4. Undeclared 8bit text in headers. Yep. Some mailers just didn't get
       the memo that they are supposed to encode non-ASCII text. So now
       you get to have the fun experience of mixing and matching
       undeclared 8bit text of God-only-knows what charset along with the
       content of (probably broken) encoded-words.

   If you order in the next 5 minutes, we'll ship you not 1, but 2
   ShamWows! They can be yours for $19.95 plus shipping and handling! But
   wait, there's more! ...

   Seriously though, you probably won't want to write your own rfc2047
   decoders.

   Allow me to point you at GMime's rfc2047 decoders:
   [142]https://git.gnome.org/browse/gmime/tree/gmime/gmime-utils.c#n1769

   I'd recommend using GMime (duh, I'm biased) but even if you decide to
   stick with libmimetic, at least consider using GMime's code as a guide
   for getting this right.

   In any event, I hope that I have been helpful.

   I wish I had the time to respond more completely; but yes, that was
   absolutely useful.

   GMime is probably the biggest contender at the moment, but I really
   need to sit down and work out the API.

   I'd prefer to use only one library for all MIME-fu, whether vmime,
   GMime, or mimetic, but it seems that there are different areas of pain
   with each library which complicates things a little.

   If it were possible to write something "mostly good enough" I'd do
   that, but I'd rather avoid the pain if I can help it. That just seems
   like common-sense.

   I wonder if replacing mimetic is not the only option : no rfc2047
   support, more or less stalled development, strict header parsing...
   Then, you're the one to choose, while I'd gladly try to move to GMime,
   I must admit my C++ skills are rudimentary and the resulting code would
   probably be bad.

   It was the first MIME library I came across with decent examples for
   both "attachment saving to disk", and "adding outgoing attachments".

   I'd certainly rather go through the pain of migration to a new solution
   than depend upon two mime libraries. But as a starting point I'd
   probably suggest:
    1. Add a second library for header-decoding/encoding.
    2. Then transition to it entirely.

   I'm not familiar with either vmime, or gmime, from a development point
   of view, but I'm willing to learn. Ideally somebody would do the work
   for us, but I suspect that's unlikely ;)
