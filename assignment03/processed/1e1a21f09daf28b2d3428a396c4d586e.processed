   Remember running around the playground when you were a kid? Maybe
   hanging from the monkey bars or seeing who could swing the highest?

   It wasn't just a mindless energy burn. Many have called play the work
   of childhood. Play teaches children how to make friends, make rules and
   navigate relationships.

   But for kids whose disabilities keep them from using playgrounds, those
   opportunities can be lost.

   New federal requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act are
   changing the landscape for public playgrounds, requiring them to
   include equipment, materials and designs that provide children with
   disabilities the same play opportunities as typical children.

   But as NPR sought to explore the effects of the new rules, it found
   that parents and advocates are making the real difference â not the
   federal government.

   The higher cost of "inclusive" playgrounds means many local governments
   can't afford them. And in places that do offer the kind of shared
   playing experience contemplated by the ADA, a group of frustrated
   parents is typically behind it all.

   To understand the phenomenon, NPR visited a playground in Pocatello,
   Idaho.

   A yellow-brick road leads to its entrance. Inside there are a pretend
   John Deere tractor, a make-believe general store, a clock tower and a
   tall rocket ship.

   Seven-year-old Brooklyn Fisher plays while her dad, Jonny Fisher,
   watches.

   "I get scared you might run me over," he tells her. "You go flying down
   those ramps."

   Brooklyn says back: " 'Cause I let go of my wheels, that's why."

   The wheels she's talking about are on her wheelchair.

   This playground, a sprawling, colorful mix of whimsy and history, is
   named after her: Brooklyn's Playground.

   It's designed so that children like Brooklyn, who have disabilities,
   can more easily play alongside typical children. "You create a place
   where kids of any ability are going to be playing together," Fisher
   says. "So now those kids with disabilities are going to be shoulder to
   shoulder with their peers, who they normally cannot be shoulder to
   shoulder with."

   That's the same idea behind new federal requirements that require
   accessible playgrounds. Last year, the federal government made access
   to play areas a civil right under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

   "Play areas are not just places where kids have fun," says Eve Hill, a
   civil rights lawyer with the Justice Department, which enforces the
   ADA. "They are places where kids learn to interact with the world, and
   with each other." That places playgrounds in the same category as other
   civil rights touchstones.

   "Recreation was one of the places where the civil rights movement
   started, with desegregating pools and desegregating lunch counters and
   movie theaters. These were not unimportant," she says.

   Building Brooklyn's Playground

   In Pocatello â an old railroad town bordering the Fort Hall Indian
   Reservation â Brooklyn's Playground sits on a flat, often windy park
   with a view of the Rocky Mountains.

   That it's here at all goes back to a minor domestic squabble and a bump
   on the head.

   When Brooklyn was 3 years old, her dad took her to another playground,
   and put her in a regular swing. "I thought she could handle it," Fisher
   says, "So I put her in there, and my wife said, 'I wouldn't do that.' "

   Brooklyn was born with spina bifida and has difficulty controlling her
   muscles. With no back support, she flipped out of the swing and hit her
   head.

   "So it was at that time that my wife said, 'We need to do this. We need
   to bring a playground for her, for the other kids in our community, to
   Pocatello.' "

   Inclusive designs have been evolving for decades. Federal accessibility
   guidelines have been around since the 1990s. But in recent years there
   has been a bigger push by parents, advocates and designers, amounting
   to an inclusive playground movement.

   "We have the therapeutic swings," Fisher says. "These have got backs,
   so kids that don't have that muscle tone can get in there completely,
   and feel safe and secure and swing."

   One of the elements that legally define an accessible playground is
   literally the ground.

   "We have ramps leading up to all the play structures. You have the
   solid surfaces throughout the entire playground. With walkers or
   wheelchairs it's very easy to go around this."

   If the surface weren't smooth, if it were sand or those familiar wood
   chips, kids in wheelchairs might get stuck, or their parents would have
   to carry them.

   But ramps â and other inclusive playground features â drive up costs.
   For example, the smooth, resilient surface at Brooklyn's Playground
   cost more than $150,000.

   Also, at 15,000 square feet, this playground is something most
   municipalities wouldn't have the funding to build on their own.

   So the Fishers, with the help of a local civic group, started raising
   money.

   Over eight months, the money poured in from grants and hundreds of
   individual donations, bake sales and garage sales. "We raised $580,000
   and it cost $560,000 so we have $20,000 in the maintenance fund,"
   Fisher says.

   And when it came time to build the playground, 3,000 people showed up
   to work. In a week, it was done.

   But public playgrounds are generally the responsibility of local
   governments. So, couldn't the city of Pocatello have built it?

   "Absolutely not," says Mayor Brian Blad, "not on the budget we have."

   He and officials from other municipalities tell NPR that a weak economy
   has put many local governments in survival mode â providing basic
   services and not much more.

   "The resources just wouldn't be there for a playground like this," Blad
   says. "The money is needed in so many other places."

   But as of March 15, 2012, federal law requires that public play areas
   include wheelchair-friendly surfaces and equipment that help kids with
   physical challenges move around. So if a town does build or renovate a
   playground, it must meet specific accessibility standards. And,
   localities must provide their residents with "program accessibility,"
   which means there are equal play opportunities for everyone in the
   community.

   Brooklyn's Playground and the kids who use it were enough to inspire a
   woman who stopped in Pocatello last fall during a family road trip.

   "I was definitely tearful, and a bit overwhelmed," says Amanda Bakker,
   who visited from Salinas, Calif. "My heart was pounding out of my
   chest; I had chills all over. I knew that it was a pretty pivotal
   moment for me."

   Bakker had her daughter, Tatum, with her. Tatum, who was almost 2 at
   the time, has spina bifida and uses a wheelchair.

   area accessibility guidelines, which became requirements last year.

   * The National Center on Accessibility Access To Play Areas has a
   simple [39]FAQ guide for local communities.

   * U.S. Department of Justice information about [40]filing a complaint
   alleging disability discrimination by a government or public
   accommodation.

   "I put Tatum in a swing and kind of sat back and absorbed it all,"
   Bakker recalls. "I looked up and saw an older child, maybe 10 or 12, a
   little girl, in a motorized wheelchair, up on the pirate ship,
   surrounded by three or four friends her age who were able-bodied
   children, playing and laughing."

   After a minute, it sank in: "That's when I really was struck with this
   idea of this is what it means to be included," Bakker says.

   She wanted that back home.

   "It was literally the next breath where I just knew that we were going
   to have to find a way to make an experience like this possible in our
   hometown as well."

   The City of Salinas approved Bakker's request to build the playground
   in a public park. She has raised about $400,000 so far, and expects
   construction to begin next month.
