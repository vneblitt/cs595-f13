CFO Spokesman: No Moratorium on Tax Lien Sales Without an Act of Council

   Posted by [86]Aaron Wiener on Sep. 9, 2013 at 3:21 pm

   Gandhi_N-1 Mayor Vince Gray [87]called for a moratorium on tax lien
   sales this morning, following a Washington Post [88]investigation that
   found that a handful of investors had gamed D.C.'s system to deprive
   people of their homes for outstanding tax debts of less than $1,000.
   But absent a new law by the D.C. Council, his plea won't carry much
   weight: The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, which oversees the
   tax sales, has no intention of stopping the practice.

   "It's up to the mayor and the Council to draft and pass legislation,"
   says OCFO spokesman David Umansky. "Whatever they pass--and we're
   working with them on it--we will follow the law, as we've done
   consistently."

   Umansky says the Post stories neglected to mention a key fact: The most
   egregious cases, in which people lose their homes over small tax bills,
   haven't taken place since 2007, when a new policy dictated that tax
   sales could not take place for debts under $1,000.

   "All of the instances cited by the Post happened in the year 2007 or
   earlier, and that they could not happen today, because of changes made
   in the system by the Office of Tax and Revenue," Umansky says. "The
   Post story is talking about things that happened six, seven, eight
   years ago."

   D.C.'s chief financial officer (currently Natwar Gandhi, who intends to
   retire soon) is appointed by the mayor but operates independently of
   the mayor's office. "The mayor has his duties, and the CFO has its
   duties," says Umansky. Absent a new law to change the process for tax
   lien sales, Umansky says his office will continue to conduct them as it
   has.

       Didn't OTR stop doing tax sales for under $1k for administrative
       ease issues, not because it was ripe for p.r. disasters?

       The CO office Is a disaster that operates in the midnight.
       This is the same CFO that prevents a business from obtaining
       a clean hands stamp the same day to allow a business to apply
       for a license at DCRA, a policy that started in july of this year .
       You now must wait one to four weeks or longer to obtain online.
       Mr Grand Ghandi needs to leave now.

       I would like to comment regarding David Urmansky's statement that
       since 2007, properties delinqent under $1,000 could not be
       auctioned off. Mr. Urmansky's statement is incorrect. Clearly the
       D.C. Register, Title 9 of the DC Municipal Regulations, Section
       317, states that properties owing at least $800 would be advertised
       and sold at the 2010 tax sale auction; for properties owing $500
       would be advertised in the 2011 tax sale auction.
       Properties owing $200.00 or more were auctioned off in July 2013.
       Check the amount owed column(2013 tax sale list:
       [99]http://otr.cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/otr/publicat
       ion/attachments/2013TaxSaleNewspaper.pdf.
       And while Stephen Cordi, deputy chief financial officer of the D.C.
       Office of Tax & Revenue (OTR) and Dr. Natwar Gandhi try to collect
       back taxes of a few hundred dollars from low income, disabled,
       senior homeowners, last year, without any hesitation their office,
       the OTR, graciously reduced commerical property assessments by $2.6
       Billion.
       There was a turnover in staff in the Harriet Walter's scandal, and
       there needs to be another now. The first to go immediately? Stephen
       Cordi and Dr. Gandhi. I would be happy to help pack their bags.

       What a bunch smug jerks...Gandhi is asleep at the wheel, has been
       for a awhile. GOOD RIDDANCE!!
       Cordi- does he even live in DC? An out of touch overseer monkey who
       is just doing the bidding of the crooks that make out like fat rats
       off of DC government.
       Umansky- does he live in DC? Just another a hole monkey getting
       away with a DC salary and screwing the people over.
       There is no accountability at OTR!!!

       There is no accountability at OTR and no oversight from the
       council's Finance & Revenue Committee (2 of whom have declared
       their candidacy for mayor), which is duly charged with knowing what
       the hell is going on before we all read it in the press. The mayor
       and the council can't excuse themselves for not knowing, because
       OTR has been a runaway train for years, and they chose to not pay
       attention!!! They don't receive their high salaries to feign
       ignorance every time their is an embarassing disclosure.

       I know someone whose incapacitated elderly relative similarly lost
       her home and he has spent more than 10 years trying to get DC
       government officials and Del. Norton to investigate the wrongdoing.
       He finally gave up after being ridiculed and dismissed as being
       disruptive at ANC meetings, because no one cared to be bothered.
