Inquiring Minds: Alan Lomax Goes North

   August 16, 2013 by [14]Erin Allen

   (The following is a guest post by Guha Shankar, folklife specialist
   with the Library of Congress American Folklife Center.)

   A fall landscape of orange and red foliage rushes by a car winding down
   a long roadâ¦a stern-faced singer draws his bow across a
   single-stringed lute and sings a ballad in Serbian about the 1389
   Battle of Kosovoâ¦ an elderly couple softly recite Finnish hymns in the
   parlor of their homeâ¦a man and woman trade French song verses in call
   and response style by the fading light of day.

   These sounds and images are only a few of the astonishing range of
   roots music and cultural communities in the American Upper Midwest that
   were recorded 75 years ago this week for the Library of Congress by
   Alan Lomax, legendary folk song collector and then assistant in charge
   of the Libraryâs Archive of Folk Song.Â  It is just as eye-opening that
   the 23-year-old Lomax set out on his pioneering tour of Michigan, the
   âmost fertile sourceâ for folk songs in the summer and fall of 1938,
   alone in a Library car. He had with him little else but his recording
   kit, which consisted of an instantaneous disk cutting machine, dozens
   of blank disks and remarkably, a 16mm film camera.Â  He returned to
   Washington after three months on the road with nearly a thousand
   recorded songs and several hundred feet of motion picture images
   (sadly, several rolls of film were stolen on a stop during the
   expedition and never recovered).

   Now, on the 75th anniversary of that trip, the [15]American Folklife
   Center, which houses the [16]Alan Lomax Collection, and several
   institutions are jointly commemorating the journey. The two film clips
   below are excerpted from a longer documentary that, together with my
   colleague, Jim Leary, University of Wisconsin folklorist and noted
   cultural historian of the region, Â I produced and edited for the
   Library of Congress.Â  The documentary marries the all-too-brief silent
   film footage that Lomax shot to audio disk recordings of the same
   performers; the microphone can clearly be seen in the shot on several
   occasions.Â  But, given the absence of any recording logs or other
   notation about the filming and what music was being played at that
   exact moment, the choice of the audio track that I joined to the
   picture is based solely on reasonable conjecture, decided upon by
   Leary.Â  On several instances, I slowed the film frame rate severely in
   the digital editing system to accommodate a few more seconds of audio.
   Jim Leary is also producing a set of archival recordings of the
   region's musical communities culled from the Libraryâs Lomax collection
   that will include more than 40 full-length tracks from Lomaxâs 1938
   trip.

   In this first clip, Lomax filmed the Floriani family, a Croatian
   tamburitza group that also played more popular styles of music, in the
   front yard of their home in Ameek, Mich. It is a town in the âCopper
   Country,â which is a reference to mining, the main industry in that
   part of the state.Â  There are several shots of a mine in the first
   part of the clip under which the song â31st Level Bluesâ is playing.Â
   It is about mine work â â31st levelâ refers to the depths that miners
   have to descend to do their jobs â and the lyrics amplify the hard toil
   and weariness of the occupation and the antagonism that characterized
   relations between mine workers and bosses.Â  The second song highlights
   the groupâs facility as tamburitza performers and the track used here
   is a traditional Croatian ballad, âMajko Mojeâ (My Mother)

   'rtmp://stream.media.loc.gov/vod/blogs/lomaxdoc_florianis_bumper.mp4'}
   ], mediaType: 'V', autoPlay: false, playerSize: 'smallWide' }
   The second clip features Mose and Exilia Bellaire, French-Canadian
   residents of Hancock, Mich., singing âDites moi pourquoi un?âÂ  It is a
   version of âThe Carol of the Twelve Numbers,â which has been documented
   throughout Europe and North America as far back as the mid-nineteenth
   century.

   'rtmp://stream.media.loc.gov/vod/blogs/lomaxdoc_bellaires_bumper.mp4'}
   ], mediaType: 'V', autoPlay: false, playerSize: 'smallWide' }
   The 75th anniversary projects also include a series of podcasts
   produced by the Library, a potential e-book, âMichigan-I-O,â slated to
   be published by Dust to Digital Records, as well as public programming
   consisting of lectures and concerts, a traveling exhibition, and the
   dissemination of recordings to the communities in Michigan. In addition
   to the Library, participants in the projects include the Michigan State
   University Museum, Michigan Council for the Humanities, the Great Lakes
   Traditions Endowment; the Center for the Study of Upper Midwestern
   Culture at the University of Wisconsin, the Association for Cultural
   Equity (ACE), and the Finlandia Foundation.

   Keep an ear and an eye out for more such performances in the days and
   weeks ahead, drawn from the American Foklife Centerâs Archive.

       How beautiful it was for Mr. Lomax to have the forethought to
       capture those moments. A national treasure!
