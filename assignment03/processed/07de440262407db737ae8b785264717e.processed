The Incredible Shrinking VO

   Posted by [86]Ally Mutnick on Sep. 9, 2013 at 1:49 pm

   Councilmember Vincent Orange is sweating--and not just [87]because of
   the FBI. Orange has dropped 45 pounds thanks to a two-year regimen of
   diet and exercise, and hit his goal weight of 200 pounds this summer.

   "There's no secret," Orange says of his regimen. "It's nothing I
   invented."

   Orange's morning routine includes 150 jumping jacks, 50 sit-ups, 50
   push-ups, stretching, and some weight-lifting in his home gym in
   Brookland. Orange eats cereal for breakfast and salad for lunch.
   (Dinner, on the other hand, is always a "decent" meal, he says.)

   Some people made fun of his slow weight loss in the beginning, Orange
   says. To speed things up, Orange gave up alcohol for six months. The
   councilmember has since abandoned teetotalism.

   New suits and an improved golf game later, the at-large councilmember
   is just waiting for some abs. "I'm trying to get ripples in my
   stomach," Orange says.

       He must have been feeling frisky when he posted pics of him and his
       staffer/side squeeze earlier this year.

       Mayor??
