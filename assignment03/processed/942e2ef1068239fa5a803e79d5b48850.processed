Go to Where it all Began at Minute Man Historical Park

   [56]image

   Summer is a great time to take advantage of our national parks and
   monuments. Many offer free or low-cost admissions and programs perfect
   for families. So this summer we will be featuring one of our country's
   public lands every week and highlighting things you and your family can
   do there.

Minute Man National Historical Park

   Image description: Militia march at Minute Man National Hisorical Park

   [57]Minute Man Historical Park is where the Revolutionary War all
   began. Located 22 miles outside of Boston, the park lets you visit the
   iconic towns of Lexington and Concord. Start your trip at the Visitor's
   center and watch the film "Road to the Revolution" where you'll learn
   about Paul Revere's legendary ride as well as the famous battles at
   Lexington and North Bridge.

   Then walk along the five-mile Battle Road Trail. This trail connects
   Concord and Lexington and is the same path where many minutemen walked
   during the start of the Revolution.

   You could also take a guided tour to help you learn about the colonial
   men and women who played an important role in our nation's history.
   One tour is "Who Were the Minutemen?" where you join a ranger costumed
   as a minuteman as he explains what the militia did and also includes a
   demonstration firing of a 18th century musket.

   Another tour is the "Some Were for Making a Stand" tour. A ranger joins
   you at North Bridge and explains the April 19th, 1775 opening battle of
   the Revolution. There are many other scheduled tours available
   throughout the summer. [58]Find more information.

   Kids can also enjoy learning about the U.S. Revolution at Minute Man
   Historical Park. The Whitmore house lets children try on traditional
   colonial clothing, organize the day and help prepare a meal. Everyone
   has the chance to participate in the Hats Off! Homespun Tribute play
   where you and your family can learn why spinning thread, shopping and
   cooking were important to the revolution.

   Minute Man Historical Park is also full of historical reenactments and
   events that are not only interesting but also educational; to learn
   more about the park activities and to plan your visit take a look at
   the[59] schedule of events.
