Jefferson's Recipe for
Vanilla Ice Cream

   [13]Jefferson's Recipe for Vanilla Ice Cream
   Holograph recipe,
   1780s
   [14]Manuscript Division

   A passionate gourmet, Jefferson acquired a stock of standard French
   recipes for sauces, fruit tarts, French-fried potatoes, blood sausages,
   pigs' feet, rabbit, pigeons, and various other dishes. Among the most
   popular of these recipes at Monticello was this one for vanilla ice
   cream--written by Jefferson, with his own recipe for Savoy cookies to
   accompany the dessert on the back.
