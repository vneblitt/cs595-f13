‚West Side Story‚ Redux

   August 19, 2013 by [14]Erin Allen

   "West Side Story," 1958. Printed by Artcraft Litho. & Ptg. Co. Inc.
   Prints and Photographs Division.

   On August 19, 1957, ‚West Side Story‚ began its pre-Broadway tour at
   the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. About a month later, it opened
   on Broadway, changing the nature of the American musical and
   challenging the country‚s view of itself. The show dealt seriously with
   violence, adolescent gangs and racial prejudice‚themes rarely included
   in musicals‚and ended with one of the show‚s leads dead on stage. The
   integration of music, dance and script, as well as the theatricality of
   the staging were a revelation to audiences.

   The musical‚s success must be credited primarily to its creators.
   Composer Leonard Bernstein created his most memorable score‚complex,
   passionate, tuneful, shocking and bursting with rhythmic energy. Jerome
   Robbins, credited with conceiving the show, doubled as director and
   choreographer. Lyricist Stephen Sondheim, in his first Broadway
   musical, exhibited the wit, intelligence and craft that would make him
   the pre-eminent songwriter of his generation. Arthur Laurents staged
   the adaptation of William Shakespeare's ‚Romeo and Juliet‚ in
   contemporary Manhattan with a lean, concise libretto, which allowed for
   the integration of language, music, dance and movement. All of these
   elements came together to create a groundbreaking musical.

   If you missed the opening by a few decades, you can still see the
   [15]online exhibit. ‚West Side Story: Birth of a Classic,‚ drawn mostly
   from the Library‚s extensive Leonard Bernstein Collection, offers a
   rare view into the creative process and collaboration involved in the
   making of this extraordinary production. Included in the exhibition are
   unique items such as an early synopsis and outline of the script;
   Bernstein‚s annotated copy of "Romeo and Juliet"; choreographic notes
   from Robbins; two original watercolor set designs by Oliver Smith;
   original music manuscripts; a facsimile of a Sondheim lyric sketch for
   the song "Somewhere"; and amusing opening-night telegrams from
   celebrities such as Lauren Bacall, Cole Porter and Betty Comden and
   Adolph Green.

   Also included are notes that reveal actors who auditioned, such as
   Jerry Orbach and Warren Beatty, who was described as "good voice‚can‚t
   open his jaw‚charming as hell‚clean cut." As an added bonus, the
   Library has the very first prints made of several never-before-seen
   production photographs taken for Look magazine for a feature spread
   that never ran.

   The composer, conductor, writer and teacher Leonard Bernstein
   (1918-1990) was one of 20th-century America's most important musical
   figures. The [16]Leonard Bernstein Collection¬ is one of the largest
   and most varied of the many special collections held by the Library‚s
   Music Division. Its more than 400,000 items, including music and
   literary manuscripts, correspondence, photographs, audio and video
   recordings, fan mail and other types of materials extensively document
   Bernstein's extraordinary life and career.
