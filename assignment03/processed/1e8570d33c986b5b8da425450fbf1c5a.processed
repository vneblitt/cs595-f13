   Natalie Bomke has been named as co-anchor of "Good Day Chicago," on
   WFLD-Ch. 32. (Fox photo / September 11, 2013)
   By Robert Channick Tribune reporter

   9:28 p.m. CDT, September 11, 2013

   WFLD-Ch.32 has named Natalie Bomke as co-anchor of "Good Day Chicago,"
   filling the void left by the departure of Kori Chambers.

    Bomke will co-anchor the newscast weekdays from 5 to 7 a.m. alongside
   Dawn Hasbrouck beginning Sept. 30, according to a Fox spokeswoman.

    A Springfield native and University of Illinois graduate, Bomke comes
   to Fox 32 from KRIV-TV in Houston, where she served as morning anchor
   for the Fox-owned station for the past three years. Previously she was
   a morning news anchor and reporter for KTXL-TV in Sacramento, and
   before that worked for WICD-TV in Champaign.

    She replaces Chambers, who is headed to WPIX-TV in New York to become
   morning co-anchor beginning October 7, the Tribune Co.-owned station
   announced this week. Tribune Co. also owns the Chicago Tribune, among
   other media properties.
