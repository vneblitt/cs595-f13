Version Control System (VCS) Usage Survey

   Researchers at the University of Illinois are conducting a research
   project to learn about Version Control System (VCS) Practices. By
   answering this short survey, you can help us better understand
   developers' practices.

   This survey contains 18 questions and should take 5 to 20 minutes of
   your time. We will not ask for your email or any other identification
   information. Nevertheless, all replies are stored anonymously and we
   will only publish aggregated results once the survey is over.
   Participation will pose no risks greater than normal, everyday risks.
   You must be 18 or older to complete this survey. Participation is
   voluntary so, if you like, you can skip any and all questions.

   For more information about this study, or if you have a concern or a
   complaint, contact Professor Danny Dig at [1]dig@illinois.edu.
   If you have any questions about your rights as a participant in this
   study, please contact the University of Illinois Institutional Review
   Board at 217-333-2670 (collect calls accepted if you identify yourself
   as a research participant) or via email at [2]irb@illinois.edu.

   By continuing you agree to these terms.

   Thanks for your help and let's get started...
