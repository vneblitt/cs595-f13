   The National Zoo is located at 3001 Connecticut Avenue NW, Washington,
   DC 20008. You can get to the Zoo by [110]taking public transportation
   and [111]driving.

   There are pedestrian and vehicle entrances on Connecticut Avenue, at
   the west side of the Zoo.

   There are two entrances for pedestrians and vehicles at the east side
   of the Zoo, near Rock Creek Park. One is off Rock Creek Parkway, the
   other is at the intersection of Harvard Street and Adams Mill Road.

To get to the Zoo by public transportation:

   The Zoo's Connecticut Avenue entrance is equidistant from 2 Metrorail
   stops. There is a Metrobus stop directly in front of the Zoo.

   [112]Get details about taking Metro to the Zoo

To get to the Zoo by bicycle:

   [113]Capital Bikeshare has stations at the Connecticut Avenue
   pedestrian entrance (at 3000 Connecticut Avenue NW) and at the Harvard
   Street gate (Harvard Street and Adams Mill Road NW). [114]Find out more
   about Capital Bikeshare.

   Note: Biking is permitted only on public vehicle roads. Riding bikes,
   scooters, skateboards, and the like is prohibited on all pedestrian
   walkways. While in the Zoo, you must park or walk or carry your bike,
   scooter, skateboard, etc. There are bike racks near the Visitor Center
   and at Lion-Tiger Hill.

To get to the Zoo by car:

   You can enter the Zoo from Connecticut Avenue, Harvard Street, or Rock
   Creek Parkway. Parking in the Zoo and nearby is limited, so we strongly
   encourage you to use public transportation.

Parking:

   Parking at the Zoo costs $16 for the first 3 hours, and $22 for more
   than 3 hours. Every dollar you spend at the Zoo--for parking, food, and
   gifts--supports our education, research, and conservation efforts.

   Please note: The Zoo is a popular destination, and lots fill early in
   the day during spring break and summer, so we encourage you to take the
   [115]Metro. We are located in a city, and there is not a lot of street
   parking in the neighborhood.

Save Time and Stress--Reserve a Parking Spot

   The Zoo is a very popular destination, and parking lots often fill up
   early in the day, especially in spring and summer. Street parking in
   the neighborhood is quite limited. Reserved parking guarantees you a
   hassle-free experience while providing faster access to animal exhibits
   and Panda Plaza. The availability of spaces is limited; reservations
   may not be available on some dates.

   [116]Reserve your space now!

   Please note: You will leave the Smithsonian National Zoo website when
   you click the link above. Parking Panda is a third-party contractor.
   [117]Read Parking Panda's privacy policy.

Tour buses

   Tour bus parking is extremely limited. Tour buses may not drop off
   passengers on Connecticut Avenue. This is both unsafe and illegal.

School buses

   Parking is available most weekdays. On weekends and during the summer,
   bus parking is not available.
