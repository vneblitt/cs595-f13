   Point Pleasant, 8-29-2013. (Transcript Below)
   Governor Christie: There's nothing more Jersey than the Jersey Shore.
   Nothing more Jersey than our boardwalks. The first boardwalk in the
   country was built right here in New Jersey down in Atlantic City in
   1870, and ever since then boardwalks have been being built. 24
   beautiful light houses up and down our coast. And even seven presidents
   have vacationed on the Jersey Shore. The Jersey Shore has been a place
   for families more than anything else though, more than presidents, more
   than governors, even more than Snooki and The Situation. The Jersey
   Shore has been about families coming here and making memories with
   their parents and grandparents, with their children and grandchildren,
   with aunts and uncles. And so, when I came down here in the immediate
   aftermath of the storm and saw the destruction here in Point Pleasant
   Beach it broke my heart. You know, I wondered whether we were going to
   be able to recover, and recover quickly enough to be ready by Memorial
   Day. But you know already we've removed 96,000 cubic yards of debris
   from the state's waterways so people could swim and boat safely around
   the state. We've cleared debris from over 275 marinas, over 200 sunken
   boats, and the great news is -- and I could tell this when I was flying
   up here today, we flew up the coastline -- I've never seen the water in
   New Jersey look cleaner or better than it looks this summer and it's
   just great to see.
