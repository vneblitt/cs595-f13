   This was no ordinary debate in the Wisconsin Legislature.

   Rep. Mandy Wright (D-Wausau) shared publicly for the first time that
   she had been raped when she was 8. Rep. Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton)
   talked openly for the first time about the anguish she felt when told
   17 years ago that one of the twins she was carrying had died in utero
   and that she had to make a choice to "save the life" of her other son.
   And Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison) told the story of how, when 18 weeks
   pregnant with her second child, she ended up in the emergency room,
   where she was told the fetal heartbeat could not be detected. Then she
   was sent for an ultrasound.

   "I remember crying hysterically and wondering what I was going to see
   on that ultrasound," Taylor said during debate Thursday over a bill
   that would require women seeking an abortion to first have an
   ultrasound. It turned out to be a false alarm for Taylor, but she said
   the situation would have been much worse had there been problems and
   had she been forced to view another ultrasound before getting an
   abortion.

   "I cannot imagine going through that, finding out something was wrong,
   and [having to have another ultrasound] to terminate a pregnancy. You
   have no idea what you're doing to women. Please have some empathy and
   compassion for women."

   But these stories failed to sway Republican lawmakers, who rejected
   each of the 13 amendments offered by Democratic legislators and
   eventually approved the measure 56-39.

   After the Assembly adjourned, Hesselbein said she decided to share her
   story publicly after consulting with her son. "He said, 'Absolutely
   mom. Maybe it will change their hearts and minds.'"

   "It didn't work," she added. "But that was my hope."

   Over eight hours Thursday, Republican lawmakers passed not only the
   ultrasound bill but two other bills restricting access to abortion and
   contraception. One bans state health care plans from covering abortions
   and exempts religious groups from the state requirement to provide
   birth control insurance coverage. The other prohibits sex-selective
   abortions and imposes fines on physicians.

   The ultrasound bill also requires abortion providers to have admitting
   privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic, which Planned
   Parenthood of Wisconsin says could force the closure of its
   Appleton-area clinic.

   During a contentious floor session Wednesday, the Senate also
   [61]passed the ultrasound bill after Republican leaders cut off debate.
   Gov. Scott Walker has said he will sign the bill into law. The other
   two abortion bills now head to the Senate, where leaders say they might
   not get to them until this fall, after the summer recess.

   These bills are part of a [62]renewed push in Wisconsin and across the
   country to restrict access to abortion and birth control.

   During debate Thursday, Democrats railed against the "ghoulish" and
   "cruel" nature of the ultrasound bill and charged Republicans with
   playing politics.

   "It's about satisfying the base of your party that you need to
   survive," said Rep. Chris Danou (D-Trempealeau). The abortion bills are
   all top agenda items for Wisconsin Right to Life, the state's largest
   anti-abortion organization and a powerful force in state Republican
   politics.

   But supporters said their motives were pure.

   "This isn't about politics," said Rep. Joan Ballweg (R-Markesan). "It's
   about life."

   "We believe that somebody who may want to have an abortion may look at
   an ultrasound and ... see that what's living inside of them is not just
   a mass of cells and make a decision to have that child," added Rep.
   Joel Kleefisch (R-Oconomowoc).

   One of the amendments offered by Democrats that failed to pass would
   have specified that only an abdominal ultrasound could be required and
   not the more invasive vaginal probe.

   "No one is going to be forced to have the type of ultrasound they do
   not choose," said Pat Strachota (R-West Bend), Assembly author of the
   ultrasound bill.

   But Taylor noted that "a transvaginal wand is the standard of care. It
   provides better images than [an abdominal ultrasound]. Most places are
   not going to offer [a woman] a choice because this is the standard of
   care. This is government intrusion at its absolute worst."

   As debate was winding down, Rep. Debra Kolsta (D-Janesville)
   acknowledged that it had been a hard day with "three anti-choice bills"
   that want to "chip away at Roe v. Wade," the U.S. Supreme Court
   decision that legalized abortion in 1973.

   Supporters of the bills, who made few comments during the debate, did
   not dispute that. In fact Strachota told the stories of two women who
   decided to keep their babies after seeing ultrasounds.

   But these stories did not pack the same emotional punch as the
   first-person narratives from Democratic women lawmakers. A tearful Rep.
   Sondy Pope (D-Cross Plains), who has one child, shared how she went
   through five pregnancies in all. During her second pregnancy she was
   told by her doctor that the baby would not be born alive. "He said, 'I
   can admit you or you can wait until nature takes its course.'"

   Pope said she and her husband chose to have an abortion even though it
   was a child they wanted desperately.

   "These are not choices we like," she said. But they are ones that
   should not be dictated by politicians, she added.

   "I'm just appalled that you feel your morals [get] to play out in my
   life," said Pope in remarks meant for bill supporters. "Some decisions
   don't belong to you."

   Hesselbein and Taylor said they decided to share their personal stories
   in part to encourage other women to tell theirs. "I owe it to the women
   across Wisconsin, especially the women who elected me, to tell these
   stories," said Hesselbein. "I wasn't elected to be silent."

   What is happening in this country? How can we keep legislating one
   group's morality? And how can women keep voting in men who are making
   these kinds of decisions about women's bodies? Think, people, think!
