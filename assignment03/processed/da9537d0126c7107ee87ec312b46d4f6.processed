[25]Virginia GOP Gubernatorial Candidate: The Government Shouldn't Put
Restrictions On Birth Control

   Speaking at an event in Loudoun County, VA, on Tuesday afternoon,
   Virginia's Republican candidate for governor indicated that he does not
   support any new restrictions on birth control. Attorney General Ken
   Cuccinelli [27]said that "government legislation shouldn't address
   contraception" -- despite the fact that his record says otherwise.

   A woman in the audience asked Cuccinelli whether he would "support and
   sign personhood legislation that contains restrictions on birth control
   medication and birth control devices" if he is elected as governor. "I
   don't think government should be doing anything about birth control...
   so no I would not," Cuccinelli [28]responded. "Government legislation
   shouldn't address contraception."

   The woman pressed him on the issue, pointing out that supporting
   [29]far-right personhood measures would "automatically" threaten access
   to birth control by defining life as beginning at conception. She
   wanted to know whether to believe the "rumors" in TV ads that claim
   Cuccinelli favors placing those restrictions on women's reproductive
   rights. Cuccinelli [30]responded sharply: "I wouldn't call them rumors.
   I might call them lies."

   At a press conference following the event, the Republican candidate was
   even firmer. "I've never supported legislation that invades people's
   choices about contraception," Cuccinelli [31]asserted.

   In fact, those comments are a sharp departure from Cuccinelli's actual
   record on the personhood issue. In 2007, Cuccinelli [32]co-sponsored a
   unsuccessful measure to define life as beginning at the moment of
   conception, which would have outlawed all abortions and some forms of
   birth control. In 2012, in his role as Attorney General, he
   [33]endorsed legislation that would have updated the state constitution
   to grant personhood rights to fertilized eggs. Speaking in support of
   that proposal, Cuccinelli [34]noted that the fight for personhood "is
   going to last for all of our lives."

   And even outside of personhood, the attorney general hasn't exactly
   proven himself to be a strong supporter of sexual health resources. An
   outspoken opponent of the health reform law, Cuccinelli [35]filed a
   lawsuit against it in 2011 -- even though repealing Obamacare would
   obviously eliminate its birth control provision that ensures
   [36]thousands of women can access contraception through their
   employer-sponsored health plans without an extra co-pay. And in 2005,
   Cuccinelli attempted to [37]censor a safe sex event at a university
   because he considered booths with information about preventing
   unplanned pregnancies and STDs to be a "soft core porn show." He has
   also waged wars against [38]abortion clinics and [39]oral sex.

   Back in 2003, Cuccinelli even [40]opposed a bill to make it clear that
   contraception isn't a form of abortion, which could have helped protect
   women's birth control access from falling victim to anti-abortion
   attacks.

   Women's health advocates were quick to criticize the attorney general
   for attempting to obscure his far-right record on reproductive rights.

   "Ken Cuccinelli is trying to muddy the waters on issues important to
   women and we're not buying it," Cianti Stewart-Reid, the executive
   director of Planned Parenthood Virginia PAC, said in a statement. "The
   truth is, he is one of the most extreme candidates Virginia has ever
   seen, and that's why we'll be working double time to educate Virginia
   voters about the high stakes for women's health this November."
