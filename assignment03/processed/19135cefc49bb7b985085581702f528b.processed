 Secretary-General's Mechanism for investigation of alleged use of chemical
                           and biological weapons

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ----------------------------------------------

   For more information on the current investigation into the alleged use
   of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, click [85]here

   alleged use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, concerning
   the incident which occurred in the Ghouta area of Damascus on 21 August
   2013, click [86]here

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ----------------------------------------------

   The Secretary-General's Mechanism to carry out prompt investigations in
   response to allegations brought to his attention concerning the
   possible use of chemical and bacteriological (biological) and toxin
   weapons was developed in the late 1980s. Triggered by a request from
   any Member State, the Secretary-General is authorized to launch an
   investigation including dispatching a fact-finding team to the site(s)
   of the alleged incident(s) and to report to all United Nation Member
   States. This is to ascertain in an objective and scientific manner
   facts of alleged violations of the [88]1925 Geneva Protocol, which bans
   the use of chemical and biological weapons, or other relevant rules of
   customary international law.

   The roster of experts and laboratories provided by Member States and
   the Guidelines and Procedures for the conduct of investigations
   constitute the key elements of the Mechanism. Member States encouraged
   the Secretary-General in September 2006 to update the roster of experts
   and laboratories, as well as the technical guidelines and procedures,
   available to him for the timely and efficient investigation of alleged
   use.

   The Office for Disarmament Affairs has been working with Member States
   to update the roster of experts and laboratories and the technical
   appendices of the guidelines and procedures so that they fully
   correspond with the rapid and substantial developments that have
   occurred in the biological area since the 1980s and also take into
   account the entry-into-force of the [89]Chemical Weapons Convention
   (CWC) and the establishment of the [90]Organisation for the Prohibition
   of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in 1997.

   The Office for Disarmament Affairs organized, in 2007, two meetings of
   a group of experts with the participation of representatives of a
   number of relevant international organizations. The group discussed the
   update of the 1989 Guidelines and Procedures. It decided to leave the
   main document from 1989 unaltered and recognized that a broad review
   process would necessarily entail the direct involvement of Member
   States. The group prepared revisions of the Appendices associated with
   the guidelines and procedures, in particular taking into account the
   developments in the biological area. The [98]updated Appendices focus
   on relevant technical biological aspects of investigation of alleged
   use.

   In accordance with the current Guidelines and Procedures "any
   interested Member State may designate to the Secretary-General relevant
   specialized training or courses available to qualified experts in
   support of their possible role on his behalf in carrying out
   investigations of possible use of chemical, biological and toxin
   agents, in order to facilitate achievement on a common basis of
   understanding and operation." The first-ever training course for
   experts was offered by the Government of Sweden and was conducted in
   cooperation with ODA in Umea, Sweden from 25 May to 5 June 2009.

   In order to further cooperation and enhance technical capabilities of
   investigation of alleged use, the United Nations and the World Health
   Organization (WHO) signed a [99]Memorandum of Understanding concerning
   WHO's support to the Secretary-General's mechanism for investigation of
   alleged use.
