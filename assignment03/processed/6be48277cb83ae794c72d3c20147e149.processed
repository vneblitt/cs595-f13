You've Tracked Down Hundreds Of Accessible Playgrounds. Help Us Find More!

   When NPR launched a national [29]guide to accessible playgrounds two
   weeks ago, we knew it wasn't perfect.

   It's not perfect because there isn't an official, comprehensive
   database of playgrounds with components designed for kids with special
   needs available to use as a source.

   So we asked you, our audience, to help us improve the [30]Playgrounds
   for Everyone guide by directly adding playgrounds and describing their
   features â from wide ramps to play components for kids who use
   wheelchairs, for example.
   [31]An accessible swing provides extra back and side support to help
   children with physical disabilities.

[32]Database

[33]Search For An Accessible Playground Near You

   The guide launched with nearly 1,290 locations cobbled together from a
   variety of sources, including the generous folks at
   [34]AccessiblePlayground.net. Since launch, more than 400 locations
   have been added, with another 200 edited or deleted. The result is we
   have a more useful guide for parents searching for inclusive places for
   kids to play.

   So, thank you!

   We received submissions in 41 states and hundreds of cities, from
   Aiken, S.C., to Worthington, Ohio. Parks in the Buckeye State received
   the most updates from users, followed closely by Texas, California and
   Missouri. Ten playgrounds apiece were added or edited in Houston,
   Seattle and Washington, D.C. (where NPR has its headquarters).

   This map shows the locations of playgrounds added or edited by npr.org
   readers since Aug. 27.

   We've also received scores of emails from our audience about the guide.
   Some folks had trouble adding playgrounds, so we are planning to
   improve that experience in a future update. Others offered thanks or
   shared stories about their experiences with accessible playgrounds,
   like this listener in Missouri:

   Playgrounds sound so simple but for families like mine a day at the
   playground is priceless.... For just a few moments Zach gets to forget
   the limitations he faces and everything this disease has taken from
   him.

   The guide remains incomplete, and we still need help improving it. You
   can help in several ways. If you already know of a place that has
   accessible play components (there's a [35]primer in the guide) search
   to see if we have the location. If not, add it.

   Also, we encourage you to share the [36]guide with friends â and maybe
   even your City Council member or parks department administrator â so it
   can keep growing.
