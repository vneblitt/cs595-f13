On Another Continent, Beautiful Swimmers Chat About D.C.

   Posted by [86]Joe Warminsky on Sep. 3, 2013 at 1:06 pm

   IFRAME: [87]http://www.youtube.com/embed/5-5Vo56hYhU?feature=oembed

   D.C.'s Ari Goldman and Andrew Field-Pickering, aka idiosyncratic DJ and
   production duo Beautiful Swimmers, did a swing through Europe in late
   August, including shows in Germany and an appearance at the
   [88]Dekmantel [89]Festival in Amsterdam. At that gig, they recorded a
   [90]video interview for Fact magazine, commenting on the limits of
   D.C.'s nightlife culture ("We don't usually DJ till seven in the
   morning back home," Goldman says), the wonders of the go-go PA-tape
   market, and the upcoming releases by the Swimmers' label, Future Times
   (namely, a [91]Protect-U album and 12-inches from Vancouver's [92]Mood
   Hut DJs). Field-Pickering also riffs on the vinyl-record-pressing
   industry in the United States, half-joking that "people buying Led
   Zeppelin records for the fifth time on Record Store Day" have an effect
   on smaller labels' ability to issue music on vinyl in a timely way.

   While in Amsterdam, they also [93]participated in a mix (with buddy Ron
   Morelli of [94]L.I.E.S., and Traxx from the [95]Nation label) for
   online station Red Light Radio. Coming up is an appearance at the
   [96]Basecamp Music Festival Sept. 27-29 at Camp Ramblewood in
   Darlington, Md. The Swimmers' new album Son is available [97]digitally,
   and vinyl copies indeed have been spotted at [98]D.C. stores. And in
   case you missed it, here's my City Paper [99]cover story from July
   about Future Times.
