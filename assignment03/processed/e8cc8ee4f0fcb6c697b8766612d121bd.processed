Hulk joins Northlake Public Library

   The 9-foot-tall statue of the Incredible Hulk will be officially
   unveiled at a reception on Thursday, at the Northlake Public Library,
   Wednesday, September 11, 2013 in Northlake. (Chuck Berman, Chicago
   Tribune)
   By Vikki Ortiz Healy, Chicago Tribune reporter

   September 12, 2013

   A 9-foot statue of the Incredible Hulk will be unveiled Thursday at the
   Northlake Public Library, thanks to a real-life hero who swooped in and
   saved a fundraising project in distress.

   Library officials and community members were about to give up after a
   campaign to raise money for more graphic novels, comic book-creating
   technology -- and a giant Hulk statue to draw attention to it all --
   yielded less than a sixth of the $30,000 needed to pay for the
   additions.

   "We were sort of feeling disappointed and thought, well, at least we'll
   have some money for some graphic novels," said Allison Parker, youth
   services librarian.

   But word of the Indiegogo.com campaign had spread through the Geek
   World -- with mentions in dozens of popular comic blogs, websites and
   even Maxim magazine.

   Steve Williams, owner of L.A. Boxing in Orange, Calif., heard about the
   campaign and happened to have a giant Hulk statue he was looking to
   discard.

   Williams called Northlake library officials, who got help from local
   companies willing to donate the cost of the Hulk's transportation and
   refurbishing.

   BAM! The project was saved. When the statue is unveiled, visitors can
   also begin using a new iMac, CintiQ design tablet and MakerBot 3D
   printer. Library officials hope the additions will attract new visitors
   while spreading the message that libraries are fun and open to new
   things.

   "Some people have called it the greatest thing to happen to Northlake
   in years," said Tom Mukite, an avid comic book lover who helped dream
   up the campaign.

   Mukite likens Williams' action to that of Professor Xavier from X-Men,
   who has the ability to read minds.

   In true superhero fashion, Williams is not expected to attend
   Thursday's celebration, although he plans to fly in to see it later.
