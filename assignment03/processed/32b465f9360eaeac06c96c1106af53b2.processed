Help Hold Ken Cuccinelli Accountable for His Extreme Record

   Accountable for His Extreme Record

   Last week, Ken Cuccinelli [24]claimed he doesn't ‚think government
   should be doing anything about birth control or birth control devices.‚
   And when a voter asked him whether he would ‚support and sign
   personhood legislation that contains restrictions on birth control
   medication and birth control devices,‚ Cuccinelli denied his own
   record, claiming that he‚s ‚never supported legislation that invades
   people‚s choices about contraception.‚

   But we aren‚t fooled. We know that throughout his entire career, Ken
   Cuccinelli has tried to prevent Virginia women from accessing birth
   control and other preventive care. He even introduced extreme and
   dangerous so-called ‚personhood‚ legislation which, if enacted, could
   interfere with personal, private, medical decisions relating to birth
   control, access to fertility treatment, management of a miscarriage,
   and access to safe and legal abortion.

   Dr. Wendy Klein, a women‚s health care provider in Virginia, responded
   to Cuccinelli‚s false claims saying:

   ‚As a physician, I can tell you that the policies being pushed forward
   by Ken Cuccinelli are profoundly concerning ‚ whether he admits so or
   not‚¶Ken Cuccinelli doesn‚t trust women and their doctors to make these
   personal, private decisions ‚ he needs to stay out of the examining
   room, and stay out of private medical decisions.‚

   There is no question that the Republican ticket‚s record on women‚s
   health is the most extreme that we have ever seen in Virginia. That‚s
   why we‚re seeing Ken Cuccinelli attempting to muddy the waters on
   issues important to Virginia women and our health. Well guess what,
   we‚re not buying it. That‚s because his record tells a different story.

   [25]Join us and tell Ken Cuccinelli: We‚re not fooled by your false
   statements on birth control.
