To market, to market

   "This is my chance to connect with people in Harvard Square," said Erin
   Nelson of Freebird Designs (photo 1), who is taking advantage of the
   Friday open-air market in Science Center Plaza. Bringing her cloth
   creations was Natalie LeChall of Jamaica Plain (photo 2), who waited
   for customers as they descended on the plaza (photo 3).

   The sweet scent of Vietnamese spices and harmonious, a cappella voices
   drifted through a bustling crowd, as visitors examined handmade
   necklaces and skirts stitched from colorful imported fabrics. The
   exotic-looking scene took place right in the middle of the Science
   Center Plaza at Harvard.

   For the next several Fridays, dozens of local artists, crafters, and
   designers from Boston's [83]SoWa Open Market will be at the plaza.

   Local jewelers, seamstresses, artists, and other crafters premiered
   their work under the tent last Friday as Harvard students serenaded the
   lunch-hour crowd at the Cambridge Open Market.  The open-air arts
   market is the newest addition to the growing suite of activities --
   from giant chess and checkers sets and food trucks to oversized outdoor
   beanbag chairs -- that are drawing hundreds of people to the area on
   any given day.

   "The [84]Common Spaces Program creates vibrant open spaces
   with activity and programming that serve the Harvard community and our
   neighbors," said Lisa Hogarty, vice president of campus services, which
   oversees the Common Spaces Program. "Like the Harvard Cambridge farmers
   market, the Cambridge Open Market is a great fit for the
   plaza's flexible space next to Harvard Yard. It will draw campus and
   community together, while promoting local artists and artisans."

   Surrounded by unusual necklaces built from the natural stones that
   inspired them, Erin Nelson of [85]Freebird Designs of Arlington said,
   "This is my chance to connect with people in Harvard Square."

   Sara Hartmann, co-owner of [86]Secret Ships, a new e-commerce
   import/export business, said she was delighted to have a spot at
   Harvard. A regular commuter through the Yard, she said, "The plaza is
   taking on a life of its own."

   Harvard Common Spaces teamed up with SoWa Open Market, Harvard Square
   Business Association, and the Cambridge Artists Cooperative to bring
   the market to the plaza.

   The SoWa Open Market at Harvard will be open Fridays through Oct. 18
   from 11:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
