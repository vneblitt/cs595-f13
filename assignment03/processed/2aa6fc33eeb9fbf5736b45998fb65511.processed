Encouraging Financial Literacy at a Young Age

   IFRAME: [31]http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/21213861

   On Tuesday, Dr. Jeanette Betancourt, Sesame Workshop's Senior Vice
   President, Outreach and Educational Practices, had the opportunity to
   participate in the Financial Literacy and Education Commission Public
   meeting at the Department of the Treasury in Washington, D.C. During
   her presentation (embedded above) we were able to share some exciting
   information about the impact our financial literacy outreach
   initiative, For me, for You, for Later, is having on young children and
   their parents across the country.

   We discovered that families using our financial literacy outreach
   materials experienced significantly less stress when discussing
   financial education as a family. Parents were equipped with strategies
   to introduce basic concepts of financial education to their children
   and were increasingly focused on financial awareness themselves. In
   addition, educators who used the kit were increasingly willing and able
   to introduce financial education into their curriculum.

   For me, for You, for Later is just one of the many ways Sesame Workshop
   is using the power of our beloved characters to help young children
   achieve their highest potential. To take a look at our financial
   literacy outreach materials, click here. To learn more about our
