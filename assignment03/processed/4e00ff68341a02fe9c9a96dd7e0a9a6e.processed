   Summary

   Representatives of the northern Utah business community expressed
   frustration Monday to Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, about the impact of
   partisan politics on federal immigration reform.

   "The bottom line is, partisanship does play a role but not what people
   think it does. There are not votes in the House to pass the Senate
   bill."

   Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah

   BRIGHAM CITY -- Representatives of the northern Utah business community
   expressed frustration Monday to Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, about the
   impact of partisan politics on federal immigration reform.

   "It should not be a partisan issue," said Tim Wheelwright, speaking on
   behalf of the Ogden/Weber and Davis chambers. He said the differences
   between Republicans and Democrats need to be set aside for the
   "economic prosperity" of the country.

   "That's what for business, I think, gets so frustrating is to see the
   partisanship that just pervades Washington and is really holding this
   up right now," said Wheelwright, a Salt Lake-based immigration
   attorney.

   Bishop, who met with the group in his Main Street office near the
   city's archway sign, stopped Wheelwright after he claimed that the
   Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill could pass in the House
   if leaders allowed a vote.

   "Let me interrupt you because you're not helping your point," Bishop
   said. "The bottom line is, partisanship does play a role but not what
   people think it does. There are not votes in the House to pass the
   Senate bill."

   First elected to Congress in 2002, Bishop said the split in Congress
   "is really not Republican versus Democrat. It's House versus Senate.
   ... It is a chamber issue. It's not a political issue."

   He said the bill passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate "is really
   a bad bill. It should not be passed under any condition. Either do it
   right or you don't do it at all."

   The GOP-controlled House, Bishop said, is attempting to individually
   tackle the major immigration issues, including border control and
   establishing a pathway to citizenship or legalization for immigrants
   living in the country illegally.

   Jim Smith, president of the Davis Chamber, said the jockeying between
   the House and the Senate is equally frustrating. "We've got to get over
   that," Smith said. "Effectively, nobody is talking to anybody."

   Warning that the debate is becoming ever more shrill, Smith asked the
   congressman what the business community can do to help make progress on
   the issue of dealing with immigrants in the country illegally.

   "You want me to be painfully honest? There's nothing you can do,"
   Bishop said. He also said he saw the tone of the immigration debate in
   Washington differently, especially after years of refusing to even
   discuss the issue.

   "I don't hear the language as more shrill at all. I hear the language
   as more accommodating than ever before," Bishop said. "You hear that
   more as a media point of view than it is reality."

   Border security has to be dealt with first, Bishop said, to create
   momentum to deal with the tougher issues. He said the focus needs to be
   on granting access to patrols on environmentally sensitive federal
   land, not building a bigger fence.

   "There is a still a great deal of anger and anxiety out there," Bishop
   said, about not only the workers but also the drug dealers, criminal
   cartels and human traffickers crossing the U.S.-Mexico border
   illegally.

   Addressing what he called the porous border will soothe that anger and
   anxiety, said Bishop, the sponsor of legislation opening up the
   protected lands to patrols. "That's why that piece is so significant."

   Wheelwright asked whether it was practical to expect the House and the
   Senate to find solutions one bill at a time, especially when it comes
   to the "elephant in the room," providing for immigrants in the country
   illegally to stay.

   Bishop said there are not members of Congress who simply hate
   immigrants. "Maybe in society there are, but in the halls of Congress,
   you're dealing with a different issue," he said.

   Any proposed reform that does not include mandatory jail terms for
   employers of illegal aliens will be a complete failure just as the '86
