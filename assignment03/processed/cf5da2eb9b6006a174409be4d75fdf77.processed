Michael Hastings National Security Reporting Fellowship, 2013-2014

   In an effort to extend the legacy of Michael Hastings, who died
   tragically on June 18, 2013, BuzzFeed will sponsor an annual, yearlong
   fellowship for national security reporting that honors Michael's
   fearless example. The first fellowship will be awarded this fall.

   The Michael Hastings Fellowship is aimed at proven journalists with
   strong sources and major stories to their credit who are interested in
   focusing for a year on a single subject and producing a series of
   stories on that topic. Proposed topics may include American foreign and
   national security policy; federal or local counterterrorism policy; the
   U.S. military; whistle-blowers; government secrecy; federal law
   enforcement; the military-industrial complex; veterans; human rights in
   conflict zones; and other related topics.

   The fellow will also have a demonstrated ability to challenge powerful
   institutions, and a clear vision for a project that tells stories that
   those in power have no particular interest in having told. The
   reporter's background may be in investigative journalism; or it may,
   like Michael's, be in powerful narrative journalism; or it may be a
   combination of the two.

   The product of the fellowship - which can be as few as a half dozen
   stories, or as many as dozens, and which could also ultimately result
   in a book - will appear on BuzzFeed. The reporter will work with
   BuzzFeed's political team and foreign editor, as well as other editors
   as needed, and will report to BuzzFeed's editor in chief.

   The fellow will receive a stipend of $100,000, plus benefits and
   related expenses for one year.

   Michael Hastings, who died at the age of 33, wrote stories that would
   not otherwise have been written, and found emotionally gripping ways to
   tell stories about vital policy decisions. He wrote for a wide range of
   new and old media outlets, from Newsweek to Gawker to GQ. His
   best-known piece, 2010's "The Runaway General" in Rolling Stone, raised
   questions about the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan, prompted the
   dismissal of the top American commander there, and sped the end of the
   U.S. engagement in that conflict. He then covered the 2012 election
   campaign and Hollywood for BuzzFeed. He was the author of three books.

Application Procedure:

   Please submit the following materials by September 1, 2013, as
   attachments or links to [332]hastingsfellowship@buzzfeed.com.
   Applications will be considered by BuzzFeed's editors and the grant
   will be awarded by October 1. The fellowship is a full-time position.
   Current and former BuzzFeed employees may apply but will not be given
   special preference. Applicants must be authorized to work in the United
   States.

Application Materials:

    1. Résumé or CV
    2. Five stories you feel are representative of your best work
    3. Project proposal. Please explain in detail, in separate sections:

    1. The broad outline of the topic you propose approaching.
    2. The specific stories you intend to write, how many, and on what
       schedule.
    3. Why this project will consume a full year.
    4. How this project can be completed in only a year.
    5. Why you are qualified and capable of doing work others haven't or
       can't.
    6. How this project is consistent with Michael Hastings' legacy.

     Three letters of recommendation. Please have your referees email
   their letters directly to us at [333]hastingsfellowship@buzzfeed.com
   using the subject line "Candidate's Last Name Reference." Your referees
   should attest to your knowledge of your subject matter and your
   professional abilities, and your capability to do work that enlarges
   readers' understanding of the chosen topic.
