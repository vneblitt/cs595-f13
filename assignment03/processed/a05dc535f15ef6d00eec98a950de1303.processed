   NASCAR driver Joey Logano previews this weekend's race at Chicagoland
   Speedway, making the Chase for the Sprint Cup for the first time, and
   NASCAR's investigation into his team's radio communications. (Posted
   September 12, 2013)
   By Jack McCarthy, Special to the Tribune

   6:09 p.m. CDT, September 12, 2013
   NASCAR's 12 finalists gathered at Navy Pier to talk Sprint Cup racing
   Thursday even as clouds lingered over incidents last Saturday at
   Richmond International Raceway that altered the final field.
   The stock car governing body issued a statement early Thursday
   following published reports of alleged collaboration between teams for
   drivers Joey Logano (Penske) and David Gilliland (Front Row Motor
   Sports) that allowed Logano a better finish at Richmond  to lock down a
   berth in the Chase for the Sprint Cup.

   "NASCAR is continuing to gather all the facts from last Saturday
   night's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event at Richmond International
   Raceway," according to a statement released just after 7 a.m. Thursday.
   "NASCAR will have no further comment until all the facts have been
   examined."
   According to published reports, radio chatter suggested that Logano be
   permitted to pass Gilliard in the final Richmond laps. Logano
   eventually finished 22nd in the race and secured a spot in the Sprint
   Cup top 10 qualifying field.
   Jeff Gordon finished out of the running, one point out of qualifying
   for the Chase top ten.
   The 10-race Chase opens with Sunday's Geico 400 at Joliet's Chicagoland
   Speedway.
   The new reports come after NASCAR issued unprecedented penalties
   against Michael Waltrip Racing for allegedly manipulating the outcome
   at Richmond Race.
   Three MWR drivers were penalized points, costing Martin Turex Jr. a
   12th place wild card qualifying slot. He dropped to 17th in the final
   standings. Newman, who drives for  Stewart-Haas Racing, moved up to
   12th and replaced Truex.
   NASCAR also fined MWR $300,000, indefinitely suspended MWR general
   manager TY Norris and placed crew chiefs for the three MWR cars on
   probation until Dec. 31.
   Top NASCAR officials have been unavailable for comment since Richmond
   fallout grew.
   In the days leading up to NASCAR drivers and officials arriving in
   Chicago for the start of the chase, NASCAR public relations contacts
   offered the Tribune an interview with CEO Brian France for Wednesday,
   with time and place to be determined. Following the events at Richmond,
   that interview was canceled by NASCAR, though racing officials contend
   the interview wasn't a certainty to happen.
   On Wednesday, NASCAR public relations staff confirmed a Thursday
   morning interview with Steve Phelps, NASCAR's chief marketing officer,
   with a request that questions be submitted in advance. The Tribune
   would not adhere to that condition and the interview with Phelps was
   canceled Wednesday. NASCAR cited a change in Phelps' schedule as the
   reason.
   The 12 Chase drivers gathered for media day and a later public
   appearance at Navy Pier, the first official events in activities
   leading up to Sunday's Chase for the Sprint Cup opener.
   Matt Kenseth enter the Chase as points leader followed by regular
   season runner up Jimmie Johnson, a multiple champion who is cast as
   Sprint Cup favorite.
   Chicagoland Speedway will also host a Camping World Truck Series race
   on Friday and  its second Nationwide Series of the season on Saturday.
