   Camden, 3-25-2013 (Transcript Below)
   Governor Christie: We cannot fail these children any longer. When I
   finally came to the point of making this decision sitting in my office
   in Trenton and I just said to myself after sitting in a meeting with
   the Commissioner and a number of members of my staff who were taking me
   through the pros and cons, after they left me I was sitting in the
   office by myself and I said two things to myself in making this
   decision, one enough is enough. Enough waiting, enough excuses, enough
   of the blame game, enough. And secondly, that this is why I believe
   people gave me the chance to do this job. Not to take on the little
   things, but take on the big challenges. When you take on big
   challenges, you run the risk of failing. But life is not a dress
   rehearsal everybody. We don't get another shot at this. Not just of
   having a job like this but of trying to mold a community and I don't
   want to look back on my time as Governor and say that I should have
   done something differently. I should have acted more aggressively, I
   should have done more for the people and the children in particular of
   this city. There will be some who will be critical. There will be some
   who will throw stones. An old story for me everybody, I'm happy to take
   them. The fact is that what no one will be able to say about the people
   assembled behind this podium and many others in this room who are
   willing to take this endeavor with us, they will not be able to say
   that we didn't act. And I believe that failure to act in this instance
   is a greater sin than any other mistake than we could make.
