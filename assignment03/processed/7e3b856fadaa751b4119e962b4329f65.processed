Marijuana Activists Withdraw Their Referendum for Now

   Posted by [86]Will Sommer on Sep. 4, 2013 at 12:11 pm

   Facing opposition from the District's attorney general, supporters of a
   referendum to decriminalize marijuana withdrew their proposed ballot
   initiative today. But according to Adam Eidinger, one of the
   referendum's backers, that was all part of the plan.

   The initiative includes language offering drug treatment and awareness.
   That runs afoul of the District's prohibition on referendums
   appropriating city money, according to an Aug. 27 letter from attorney
   general Irv Nathan. Eidinger says he was testing the city to see what
   its reaction would be.

   He plans to resubmit by the end of next week.When he does, the
   initiative will have language legalizing marijuana possession in the
   District, instead of just replacing criminal fines with possession with
   civil ones. Unlike Councilmember Tommy Wells' [87]decriminalization
   bill, which is expected to pass the D.C. Council sometime in the fall,
   Eidinger's initiative also legalizes home marijuana growing.

   "This initiative is going to look very different when we resubmit it,"
   Eidinger says.

   Update: Eidinger plans to resubmit his initiative by the end of next
   week, not this week.

       Adam Eidinger is known for very extreme positions. He ran for
       office. He is involved in extreme issues: libertarianism, anti-IMF
       protests, etc.

       Nice job but a minor correction is in order as DCMJ.org doesn't
       plan to re-submit this Friday but the next. This is a holy week for
       Jews, so we will need more time to prepare.

       So you don't like Adam, therefore the referendum ____? Whatever you
       think about Adam Eidinger, this is a good idea and I hope the
       referendum backers write it carefully to avoid legal challenges.
       This would have a profoundly positive impact on the lives of many
       DC residents.

       I don't dislike you, Adam. (I know it's you, Adam, due to the
       avatar, extreme, and due to the timing of the two posts.)
       I don't know you personally, but I follow local affairs. I have
       seen your campaign signs and your efforts to garner attention to
       for yourself.
       Seriously, any effort lead by anarchists won't have much
       credibility.

       ward2guy -
       Your comment about someone being an extremist simply because they
       are a Libertarian is way off base. Note, Libertarianism doesn't
       mean anarchist as it once did, the modern version is much different
       these days.
       I don't know much if anything about Adam Eidinger beyond what I've
       just read, but your statement is ignorant of what many of us hold
       as the base of our principles these days. If simply having a set of
       beliefs as listed below make us extremists, does that mean you
       consider someone radical simply because they differ from your
       viewpoint?
       To clarify what a modern Progressive Libertarian believe in:
       Constitutional Law & Proper Role of Government
       Local, from the ground up policy
       Consumer Info Regulations
       Sound Monetary Policy
       Electoral Reform & Voter Activism
       Peaceful Foreign Policy & Friendly Trade
       End the War on Drugs
       Gun & Privacy Rights
       Promoting Adoption & Contraception Education
       Alternative Energy & Sustainability
