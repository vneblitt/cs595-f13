   Suzuki is recalling nearly 200,000 vehicles in the U.S. to fix an
   airbag sensor that could cause it to deploy improperly during an
   accident.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the recall
   affects 193,936 Grand Vitara SUVs from the 2006 to 2011 model years and
   SX4s from the 2007 to 2011 model years.
   At issue is an airbag sensor in the front passenger seat that could
   fail, causing the airbag to deploy during an accident, regardless of
   whether an adult or a child is sitting in the seat.

   Should the airbag deploy at full force with a child in the seat, it
   could potentially injure the child, the NHTSA said. The malfunction
   could also cause the airbag to refrain from deploying, even when an
   adult is sitting in the seat.
   The recall is an escalation of an issue [129]the safety agency first
   started investigating in June, after 128 owners had filed complaints
   saying airbag warning lights were indicating the seat was empty when in
   fact it was occupied.
   No injuries or accidents have been reported as a result of this issue.
   Owners of affected vehicles will be notified by Suzuki in October,
   although due to a parts shortage, a second note will be sent out when
   dealers are ready to fix the vehicles. Any repairs would be done free
   of charge for the consumer.
