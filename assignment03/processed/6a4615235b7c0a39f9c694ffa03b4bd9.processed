   Seaside (Transcript Below)
   GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE: So to all the men and women, some of whom are
   behind me, who were here on the ground last night, on behalf of the
   people of New Jersey I say thank you.
   Yesterday we saw what it means to be from our state. We are tough and
   we stand together in a crisis.
   To the firefighters, police officers, EMTs, the volunteers who showed
   up with coffee and food to help to feed those who were fighting the
   fires, I want to thank you too.
   We once again showed what resilient communities Seaside Park and
   Seaside Heights are. You came to help those who were helping you and
   you showed your toughness and I appreciate seeing that again.
   We honor the courage and the service of those people who fought the
   fire last night because you didn't hesitate when the call went out
   throughout the entire state to step up and help. When New Jerseyans
   call New Jerseyans they don't think twice. They come to help. That's
   what it means to be from our state, which is why I know that while we
   lost a place that has provided generations of memories to our citizens
   we will rebuild. We'll make new memories for our families because
   that's what we do.
