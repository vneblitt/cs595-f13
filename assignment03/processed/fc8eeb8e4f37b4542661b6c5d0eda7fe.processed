Obamacare Insurance Costs Affordable, Kaiser Survey Finds

   By Alex Wayne - 2013-09-05T04:01:00Z

   A 25-year-old [58]New Yorker earning $25,000 a year will pay as little
   as $62 a month for health insurance next year, and a peer living in
   Vermont may pay nothing, according to a 17-state survey of premiums
   under the U.S. health-care overhaul.

   The Kaiser Family Foundation [59]report is the broadest look yet at
   what consumers will pay for health insurance when the [60]Affordable
   Care Act takes full effect next year. The cost issue has been a top
   concern for President [61]Barack Obama's administration, which is
   trying to persuade at least 7 million Americans who now lack insurance
   to sign up for coverage starting Oct. 1.

   [62]California and [63]New York are among the states that have
   announced rates for the plans to be sold through marketplaces called
   exchanges. Republican officials in states including Ohio, Indiana and
   [64]Georgia have released partial information on premiums, emphasizing
   big increases for some customers.

   "There's obviously intense interest in what the choices are going to
   look like for consumers and what they're going to have to pay in 2014,"
   Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at [65]Menlo Park,
   California-based Kaiser, said in a phone interview. "For the most part
   insurers seem to find this market attractive and they're pricing
   accordingly."

   The health law sets up a system of state-based online and telephone
   exchanges that will sell insurance from companies including
   [66]UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) to people who don't have coverage at
   their jobs. The law makes government subsidies in the form of a tax
   credit available to discount monthly premiums for people with low- to
   moderate-incomes.

Law's Requirements

   About 25 million people are [67]expected to enroll in exchange plans by
   2018, according to the [68]Congressional Budget Office. Insurers are
   barred from denying coverage or raising premiums for people in poor
   health, or charging women more than men, common practices now. Under
   the law, they can charge their oldest customers a maximum of three
   times the price for their youngest ones, a narrower difference than in
   many states today.

   Rand Corp. researchers, looking at 10 states, said in an Aug. 29 report
   that predictions of sharp increases in premiums were overstated. "Our
   analysis found no widespread trend toward sharply higher prices in the
   individual market," Christine Eibner, a Rand senior economist, said in
   a statement with the report.

   The lowest monthly premium for a 40-year-old in the 17 states surveyed
   by Kaiser would be $146 in Baltimore. If that 40-year-old had an annual
   income of $29,000, government subsidies would reduce the monthly cost
   to $111, according to the report from the nonprofit health-research
   group.

Bronze Plans

   Those are the prices for the least-generous level of health coverage,
   called bronze. Bronze plans cover about 60 percent of medical costs and
   may cost a participant $6,350 out of pocket in deductibles and
   co-payments, in addition to premiums.

   "What has surprised me is how inexpensive some of these bronze plans
   will be," Levitt said. "They'll come with high deductibles and
   significant out-of-pocket costs for consumers, but for those who are
   looking for catastrophic protection there will be some inexpensive
   options out there, particularly if you're eligible for a tax credit."

   For $214 a month, the same Baltimore 40-year-old may upgrade to a
   "silver" plan that covers about 70 percent of medical costs and reduced
   out-of-pocket expenses. A $35 monthly subsidy would discount the
   premium to $179.

   The highest premiums in the Kaiser survey are in [69]Vermont and New
   York, where the states require insurers to charge the same amount to
   people of all ages. That helps older people, who get a break on their
   premiums, at the expense of younger people, who pay more.

   A 40-year-old in [70]New York City would pay at least $308 a month for
   a bronze plan and $336 in Burlington, Vermont. Those who qualify for
   subsidies will see greatly reduced costs. For the same person earning
   $29,000 a year, the premium is cut to $111 in New York and $116 in
   Burlington.
