   Drive-in theaters haven't disappeared from American soil, yet, but many
   of the smaller ones may go dark in the coming months.

   Hollywood is expected to stop making celluloid prints that work on
   traditional 35mm projectors. To continue showing movies, drive-ins will
   need to cough up tens of thousands of dollars to make the switch to
   digital projectors â no small feat for businesses in a long-struggling
   industry. In response, one major car company has decided to help out.

   Honda is launching a nationwide campaign called Project Drive-In to
   raise awareness for the plight of drive-ins, and to raise money to help
   at least five theater owners switch to digital. Honda unveiled a
   [50]new website dedicated to the campaign, and is letting people vote
   on which drive-ins should receive assistance, from now through Sept. 9.

   As part of the campaign, Honda is also encouraging people to donate to
   the Honda drive-in fund, and to watch at least one movie at their local
   drive-in.

   What do you think of Honda's campaign? Sound off in the comments,
