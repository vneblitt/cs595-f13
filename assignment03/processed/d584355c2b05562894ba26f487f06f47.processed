Years after recession, many in U.S. still struggling, polls show

   September 12, 2013|Susan Heavey | Reuters

   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four years after the recession officially ended,
   many American adults are still struggling to recover financially with
   lower incomes and, in some cases, going hungry, according to two
   surveys released on Thursday that underscored the unevenness of the
   U.S. economic recovery.

   Twenty percent of U.S. adults - one in five - polled last month said
   that at times in the past year they did not have enough money to buy
   food for themselves or their families, according to Gallup's findings.

   That's nearly as many hungry Americans as in 2008, when the nation was
   submerged in its deepest economic slump since the Great Depression
   nearly 80 years earlier, the national polling firm said.

   "These findings suggest that the economic recovery may be
   disproportionately benefiting upper-income Americans rather than those
   who are struggling to fulfill their basic needs," it said.

   With the future of the nation's food-stamp program in doubt in Congress
   and continuing stagnant wages for U.S. workers, "It is possible that
   even more Americans may struggle to afford food in the immediate
   future," Gallup added.

   Gallup found that Americans' overall access to basic necessities such
   as food, housing and healthcare in August continued at the near-record
   lows that emerged during the recent recession, which economists said
   began in late 2007 and ended in mid-2009, even as many Americans still
   struggle to find their financial footing.

   A separate poll by the Pew Research Center found more than half of U.S.
   adults, about 54 percent, said last week they feel their household
   incomes have "hardly recovered at all" from the downturn.

   A majority of Americans, or 63 percent, also said the U.S. economic
   system was no more secure now than before the recession, according to
   the Pew survey, also released on Thursday. For many, the nation's job
   situation was their top concern, it added.

   The two surveys come ahead of the annual measure of income and poverty
   from the U.S. Census Bureau to be released on September 19.

   Last week, the government's annual "Food Security" report found that
   14.5 percent of American households, or 17.6 million families, "had
   difficulty at some time" in getting enough to eat during 2012, meaning
   they ran out of food, didn't have money to buy enough food, skipped
   meals or lost weight for lack of food.

   That official food insecurity rate was essentially unchanged since
   2008, when the recession and rising unemployment drove up the number of
   people short of food, the report from the Agriculture Department
   showed. (For a Reuters graphic, see: http://link.reuters.com/pyv92v)

   Against this backdrop, a federal program aimed at helping Americans
   stave off hunger has become a political hostage in Washington, where
   lawmakers are dueling over funding for the food stamp effort amid a
   wider farm bill and a larger effort to pass a government budget.

   The Republican-led House of Representatives has vowed to cut up to $40
   billion from the program, formally named Supplemental Nutrition
   Assistance Program (SNAP), an effort condemned by Democrats, who
   control the Senate.

   Negotiations over the farm bill and food stamps, the largest U.S.
   anti-hunger program, could begin as soon as this month.

   At latest count, nearly 48 million Americans, or 15 percent of the
   population of 314 million, received food stamp assistance, according to
   USDA.

   Gallup said it was likely that a variety of factors, including
   depressed wages, were to blame for hunger. But it added, "increasing
   wages alone, however, is not enough to significantly increase the
   percentage of Americans who have the ability to afford food."

   Average hourly earnings bounced back in August after weak readings in
   July, according to recent U.S. data that suggested the economy was
   struggling to regain momentum.

   Many workers are also still struggling with reduced hours, which also
   affects their overall take-home pay.

   The Gallup findings, which have a margin-of-error rate of between 0.6
   and 0.8 percentage point, were drawn from Gallup's monthly well-being
   telephone survey of nearly 16,000 U.S. adults in August.

   The Pew report was drawn from its survey of 1,506 adults conducted
   September 4-8 and has a margin-of-error rate of nearly 3 percentage
   points.
