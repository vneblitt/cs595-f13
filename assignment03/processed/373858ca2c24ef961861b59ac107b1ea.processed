Study: The U.S. has had one mass shooting per month since 2009

   Congress is in the midst of a heated debate over gun control and how
   best to tamp down on gun violence. And mass shootings like the one that
   tore through Sandy Hook Elementary School last December are a huge part
   of that discussion.

   (Sarah Voisin/The Washington Post )

   So how much do we actually know about mass shootings and the people who
   commit them? A [350]new study (pdf) commissioned by Mayors Against
   Illegal Guns* tries to add some much-needed detail.

   The researchers pored through the FBI database and recent media reports
   for every mass shooting since January 2009Â â that is, incidents in
   which at least four people were murdered by guns. Here are their key
   takeaways, some of them surprising:

   1) Mass shootings have occurred at an average rate of about one per
   month since 2009. The report concludes that there have been 43 mass
   shootings in 25 states over the past four yearsÂ â or nearly one per
   month.

   2) Yet mass shootings are still a tiny portion of overall gun deaths.
   For all the attention they receive, mass shootings are not the main
   source of gun violence. In 2010, according to the FBI, [351]around
   8,775 people were murdered with firearms in the United States. Less
   than 1 percent of those victims were killed in mass shootings.

   3) Assault weapons are used in a minority of mass shootingsÂ â but
   those incidents were much deadlier. Just 12 of the mass-shooting
   incidents, or 28 percent, involved assault weapons or high-capacity
   magazinesÂ â the very same guns that some members of Congress [352]are
   now trying to ban. At the same time, mass shootings were a lot deadlier
   when assault weapons and high-capacity magazines were used, with an
   average of 8.3 deaths, compared with 5.4 deaths on average for the
   rest.

   4) Few mental-health red flags came up before most of the
   shootings.Â In just four of the 43 shootings was there evidence that
   someone had raised concerns about the mental health of the killer to
   authorities beforehand. Likewise, the report notes, there was no
   evidence that any of the shooters had been prohibited from owning
   firearms because of mental-health concerns.

   5) Domestic violence played a role in 40 percent of mass
   shootings.Â From the report: "In at least 17 of the cases (40%), the
   shooter killed a current orÂ former spouse or intimate partner, and at
   least 6 of those shooters had a prior domesticÂ violence charge."

   6) At least 11 of the shooters were prohibited from owning guns.Â Under
   federal law, felons, certain domestic abusers and people deemed
   mentally ill are barred from owning guns. The report found that at
   least 11 of the shooters fell into this categoryÂ â although there was
   no good data one way or the other for about one-third of the cases.

   7) About one-third of the shootings took place in gun-free zones.Â Some
   additional stats: "Nineteen of the 43 incidents (44%) took place in
   private residences. Of theÂ 23 incidents in public spaces, at least 9
   took place where concealed guns could be lawfullyÂ carried. All told,
   no more than 14 of the shootings (33%) took place in public spaces
   thatÂ were so-called âgun-free zones.â

   * It's worth noting that Mayors Against Illegal Guns, founded by New
   York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is a group that strongly supports
   stricter gun-control laws. But for those who want to double-check their
   claims, the group lists every single mass shooting incidentÂ â as well
   as the relevant detailsÂ â in the report.

   Further reading:

   â The full [353]reportÂ (pdf).

   â This week, the Department of Homeland Security [354]released its own
   study looking at the profile of mass shooters since 1999. One key
   takeaway? They tended to be young males acting alone using handguns.
   And very few were ex-military.

   âÂ The last assault-weapons ban didnât work. [355]Will the new one be
   different?
