   [320]PIERCE, NE - SEPTEMBER 26: Classic cars are lined up for auction
   in a field on the Lambrecht family farm on September 26, 2013 in
   Pierce, Nebraska. The cars, about 500 total, from the Lambrecht
   Chevrolet Dealership will be sold at auction this weekend. When Ray
   Lambrecht, who ran the dealership with his wife Mildred for 50 years,
   would get in a new model year car, he would put any unsold cars from
   the previous model year into storage along with any used car trade-ins
   that remained at the dealership for too long. Many were stored outdoors
   on the farm. These leftover cars, along with dealership memorabilia
   will be sold at the auction. Many of his 500 cars being offered at the
   auction have never been titled and have less than 20 miles on them. An
   estimated 10 to 12 thousand car enthusiasts from around the world are
   expected in Pierce, a town with a population of 1,700, for the auction.

   state sitting in a women only carriage on a train from New Delhi's
   Nizamuddin Station destined for Gondwana in Vidarbha region of
   Maharashtra, with men peering through the windows. The recent spate of

   according to a 2012 paper by the University of Texas and the Huascaran

   which are a source of fresh water for millions, but 22% of the surface
   area of Peruvian glaciers has disappeared in the past 30 years alone,
   according to The World Bank. Environmental issues are under the
   spotlight during a working group of the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change, who are meeting in Stockholm from September 23-27.
