   Tribune wire report

   2:58 p.m. CDT, September 17, 2013
   WASHINGTON--

   Navy Yard shooting suspect Aaron Alexis received an honorable discharge
   from the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2011, even though he exhibited a pattern
   of misconduct during his career, officials said.
   The Los Angeles Times reported that Alexis had a Navy record that
   included several unauthorized absences from duty, instances of
   insubordination and disorderly conduct, one instance of being absent
   without leave, and several failed inspections, according to a Navy
   official.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the current
   investigation, also said that in addition to his two previously known
   arrests in 2004 and 2010, Alexis had been arrested in DeKalb County,
   Ga., in 2008 on a disorderly conduct charge and held for two nights.
   Initial reports indicated Alexis, a 34-year-old Navy contractor, had
   received a general discharge from the Reserve, a category that suggests
   an unsatisfactory record. But the Navy said Alexis had in fact applied
   for and received an honorable discharge.
   The Texas man suspected of killing 12 people entered the Navy Yard on
   Monday morning and gained access to the secure Navy Sea Systems Command
   building, where he went on a shooting spree that spread panic at the
   base just a mile and a half from the U.S. Capitol. He was armed with an
   AR-15 military-style assault rifle, a double-barreled shotgun and a
   handgun, a law enforcement source said.
   A military official said that before discharging Alexis honorably, the
   Navy had been pursuing a general discharge against him on a series of
   eight to 10 misconduct charges, ranging from traffic offenses to
   disorderly conduct.
   However, when it became evident the case against Alexis would not
   support a general discharge, he was allowed to apply for an early
   discharge under what is known as the Early Enlisted Transition Program,
   which is only used for honorable discharges, the military official
   said.
   Alexis had a spate of run-ins with both civilian and military
   authorities while he was in the Navy Reserve as full-time support
   employee. He was arrested in DeKalb County, Ga., in 2009 on a
   disorderly conduct charge, and was accused of discharging a firearm by
   authorities in Fort Worth, Texas.
   He received non-judicial punishment from the military for both the
   military and civilian misconduct charges, said a Navy official, who did
   not know the exact punishment.
   Alexis died Monday in a gun battle with police.
   He had been hoping to get back into the Navy but was "experiencing
   problems" with officials at the Navy Yard and at his contracting firm,
   a federal official said. Alexis "didn't take that very well," said the
   official.
   In addition, Alexis "went to the VA to talk to them about mental-health
   issues. He was trying to get help, we think," the official said,
   referring to the government's veteran services department.
   Whatever mental-health problems Alexis faced, neither those nor his
   arrests in 2010 and 2004 for gun-related incidents prevented him from
   recently buying at least one weapon, a shotgun.
   He arrived in Washington about four months ago, friends said. He had
   worked recently for a defense contractor called The Experts, which is a
   subcontractor on an HP Enterprise Services contract to work on the Navy
   Marine Corps's Intranet network, according to Hewlett-Packard spokesman
   Michael Thacker.
   As a civilian information technology contractor, he worked on the Navy
   and Marine Corps intranet and was given a security clearance classified
   as "secret," his company's chief executive told Reuters.
   "He did have a secret clearance. And he did have a CAC (common access
   card)," said Thomas Hoshko, CEO of The Experts.
   U.S. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus on Tuesday ordered a review of physical
   security at all Navy and Marine Corps installations in the wake of
   Monday's shootings.
   The official said the Navy would first take a "quick look" at
   installations to make ensure existing physical security standards are
   being met. The second review will be larger and more in-depth, the
   official said.
   A 'sweet and intelligent guy'

   Alexis, used a valid pass to gain entry to the base, the FBI said on
   Tuesday.

   "Mr. Alexis had legitimate access to the Navy Yard as a result of his
   work as a contractor and he utilized a valid pass to gain entry to the
   building," said Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the
   FBI's Washington field office.

   Authorities believe Alexis entered the base's Building 197 with a
   shotgun and may have gained access to a handgun inside.

   There is no information that he had an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle,
   Parlave said, adding that the shotgun was bought legally in Virginia.
   Those who knew Alexis in recent years describe him as a "sweet and
   intelligent guy" (a regular customer at the Thai restaurant where he
   worked as a waiter), as "a good boy" (his landlord), but also as
   someone who was "very aggressive," someone who seemed like he might one
   day kill himself (a lay worker at the Buddhist temple where Alexis
   worshiped.)
   In 2004, Alexis was arrested in Seattle after he fired three shots from
   a Glock pistol into the tires of a Honda Accord that two construction
   workers had parked in a driveway adjacent to Alexis' s house.
   Alexis's father told Seattle detectives then that his son "had
   experienced anger management problems that the family believed was
   associated with PTSD," or post-traumatic stress disorder, according to
   the police report. The father said that Alexis "was an active
   participant in rescue attempts of Sept. 11, 2001."
   Alexis's own explanation for his behavior that day: the construction
   workers had "mocked" and "disrespected" him and then he had had "a
   black-out fueled by anger."
   Alexis was not charged in the Seattle incident.
   More recently, Alexis struck those who crossed his path as a man of
   sharp contrasts. He studied the Thai language, visited Thailand for a
   month, was studying for an online degree in aeronautical engineering
   and seemed to enjoy conversing with customers, according to friends,
   customers and fellow worshipers. But some of those same people said
   that Alexis had an aggressive streak, one that caused them to keep
   their distance and avoid personal questions.
   Discharged for 'misconduct'
   Alexis grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., with his mother Sarah and father
   Anthony Alexis, according to his aunt Helen Weeks. "We haven't seen him
   for years," Weeks said in a phone interview. "I know he was in the
   military. He served abroad. I think he was doing some kind of computer
   work."
   Alexis spent nearly four years in the Navy as a full-time reservist
   from May 2007 until he was discharged in January 2011, according to a
   summary of personnel records released by the Navy. A Navy official,
   speaking on condition of anonymity, said Alexis was discharged from the
   service in January 2011 for "misconduct," and that the 2010 firearms
   incident in Texas played a role in his departure.
   He achieved his final rank of Aviation Electrician's Mate 3rd Class in
   December 2009.
   Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said Alexis worked as a defense contractor
   after his discharge. A deleted LinkedIn page under Alexis's name listed
   SinglePoint Technologies, a Richmond, Va., firm, as his employer; the
   company did not return a call seeking comment.
   Alexis spent the bulk of his service time -- from 2008 to 2011 --
   assigned to the Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 46 at Naval Air
   Station Fort Worth in Texas, from 2008 until he left the service in
   2011, records show. He was awarded the Global War on Terrorism Service
   Medal and the National Defense Service Medal -- two awards of minor
   distinction.
   In Fort Worth, Alexis lived for a time in a gated townhouse community
   called Orion at Oak Hill. In September, 2010, police were called to
   Apartment 2023 after Alexis's downstairs neighbor complained that
   Alexis had fired a bullet through his floor and into her ceiling below.
   The woman told police that she had had occasion to call them about
   Alexis several times for being too loud, but that nothing had been
   done. The woman said Alexis had confronted her a few days earlier in
   the complex's parking lot, where he complained that she had been making
   too much noise. The woman told police that "she is terrified of Aaron
   and feels that this was done intentionally," the police report said.
   Police made three attempts to contact Alexis by knocking on his door,
   but he didn't respond. Only after police called in firefighters to
   force entry into his apartment did Alexis emerge. Alexis then told
   police that he had been cleaning his gun while he was cooking and his
   hands had become greasy and the weapon discharged by accident,
   according to the police report.
   "He told me that he began to take the gun apart when his hands slipped
   and pulled the trigger, discharging a round into the ceiling," the
   officer wrote.
   Alexis was arrested for improper discharge of a firearm, but a
   spokesman for the county district attorney's office said no charges
   were brought in the matter. Alexis's mugshot from that arrest shows a
   clean-shaven man with soft eyes and an impassive expression.
   A couple of weeks later, the apartment complex began eviction
   proceedings against Alexis, according to county court records.
   Connection to meditation center
   Soon after that, Srisan Somsak, a Thai immigrant in Fort Worth, met
   Alexis at the Wat Busayadhammavanaram Meditation Center, where Alexis
   had occasionally shown up for meditation starting in summer of 2010.
   Alexis said he needed a place to stay and Somsak offered to rent him
   the two-bedroom white bungalow behind the center -- if he promised not
   to smoke or drink.
   Alexis rented the place for $600 a month, lived up to those promises
   and never missed a payment, said Somsak, 57.
   "He's a good boy," said Somsak, who spoke English with a heavy accent.
   "Everybody would say, 'He's a good boy' here. Not only me. He's a good
   boy."
   Alexis occasionally meditated at the temple and helped out there when
   needed, said Somsak, who was pleased to find that his tenant studied
   the Thai language and visited Thailand.
   On Monday, as word spread about the shooting, the temple filled with
   members eager to share their recollections of Alexis. "They don't
   believed it that he could kill 12 people like that," Somsak said. "I
   think probably somebody tried to put him down. I don't know. "Did
   somebody try to discriminate against him? That's the only way. That's
   what I keep thinking."
   Somsak asked Alexis only once about why he had left his job at the
   naval base. It was a brief conversation.
   "I asked him, 'Why you quit the job with the government?" Somsak said.
   "He said, 'Somebody doesn't like me.'"
   Somsak left it there because "I don't want to go too deep with him."
   Alexis visited the center about twice a week and was known as a quiet,
   if tightly wound, participant, according to a temple staff member.
   "He would help people if they came in carrying heavy things," said J.
   Sirun, an assistant to the monks. "From the outside, he was a quiet
   person. But on the inside, I think he was very aggressive. He did not
   like to be close with anybody, like a soldier who has been at war."
   Sirun said he avoided Alexis, who preferred to keep to himself. But
   Alexis was no longer; he had many Thai friends and spoke Thai "very
   well," Sirun said. "He understood about 75 percent of the language."
   During that period, Alexis worked as a waiter and delivery man for the
   Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White Settlement, Texas, according to
   customers and workers there. Customers saw him studying Thai at a table
   there during his off hours.
   Alexis stopped showing up at the Buddhist center early in 2011, Sirun
   said.
   "I didn't think he could be this violent," Sirun said. "I would not
   have been surprised to hear he had committed suicide. But I didn't
   think he could commit murder."
   Relatives contacted by reporters were stunned to hear that he was
   involved in the Washington shootings. "I'd be shocked if it was him,
   but I don't know," said Weeks, his aunt, her voice trailing off.
   Even as he worked for the defense contractor, Alexis was pursuing a
   bachelor's degree in aeronautics as an online student at Embry-Riddle
   Aeronautical University. The university, in Daytona Beach, Fla., said
   Alexis enrolled in July 2012, via the school's Fort Worth campus. He
   remained a student in good standing, said Melanie Hanns, Director of
   University Communications.
   "He was enrolled for this semester," she said.

   Defense review ordered

   FBI Assistant Director Valerie Parlave asked the public to call
   1-800-CALL-FBI with details about Alexis: "No piece of information is
   too small."

   Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel aims to order a review of physical
   security and access at all Defense Department installations worldwide,
   a senior Pentagon official said on Tuesday.

   Hagel is still defining the parameters of the review with input from
   Pentagon leaders. The review could be formally announced as soon as
   Wednesday, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity

   President Obama will be briefed on Tuesday on the details of the
   Washington Navy Yard shootings by his national security aides,
   including Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director James Comey,
   White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
