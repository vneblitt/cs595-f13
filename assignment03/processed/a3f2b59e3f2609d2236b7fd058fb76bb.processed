   Another season, another conspiracy to end the world. Thatâs not the
   fatigue of so much Apocalypse Pop talking: In the grim noir world of
   Foxâs Sleepy Hollow - which premieres tonight at 9 p.m. on Fox -- U.S.
   history is reimagined as the product of a never-ending, always
   stalemating supernatural shadow war, pitting truth-keeping, true
   believing patriots against black magic terrors bent on annihilating us
   from creation. At least, that's what the "good guys" say. The bad guys
   have yet to speak...maybe because they're lacking for heads. Say hello
   to what could be the seasonâs goofiest yet intriguingly subversive
   allegory for our troubled post-modern times.

   Or not. Maybe Iâm just looking for a way to make interesting a certain
   kind of American horror story that feels been there, done that: Sleepy
   Hollow -- the umpteenth adaptation of Washington Irvingâs The Legend of
   Sleepy Hollow, that sacred text of homegrown Gothic lit, Halloween
   merchandisers, and high school English teachers -- is yet one more
   franchise in which Fate-tapped/Fate-trapped heroes battle some ungodly
   or tragically misunderstood yet no less threatening Creep of the Week.
   (Also see, at present: Grimm, Supernatural.) You can practically hear
   the Doc Frankensteins who created this thing -- superstar producers
   Alex Kurtzman and Bob Orci (Star Trek, Transformers, Fringe), director
   Len Wiseman (Underworld, Total Recall), and writer Phillip Iscove --
   sewing together pieces of dead cult pop to make this monster mashup.
   Buffy and Angel, Kolchak, Twin Peaks, and The X-Files, The Da Vinci
   Code and National Treasure, Highlander, and Smallville.

   And yet there is peculiar electricity crackling through this familiar
   bag of bones. Sleepy Hollow is, first and foremost, handsomely produced
   horror, good-looking and BOO! scary. Tom Mison is a garrulous gust of
   fun as Ichabod Crane, the chivalrous ghostbuster from the 18^th century
   trying to stave off the end times, not to mention make sense of the
   21^st century. Cars? Emancipated slaves? A coffee shop on every corner?
   WTForsooth?! Misonâs performance suggests what might happen if an actor
   studied Hugh Jackman in Kate & Leopold and Hugh Jackman in Van Helsing
   and tried -- rather successfully -- to blend both. He's well matched by
   Nicole Beharie as Abbie, the crackerjack, going-placed cop who decides
   to help Ichabod battle ghouls, figure out cellphones, and reconstruct
   the more anachronistic and politically incorrect aspects of Colonial
   Era worldview. Heâs an old soul; sheâs a modern woman. Heâs white,
   sheâs black. The show is self-aware about their differences and could
   do something dramatically interesting with them. And the Headless
   Horseman is an effectively fearsome force that radiates a fair amount
   of personality despite being facially-challenged; I dig his unrelenting
   Terminator air and the cocky twirl of his battle axe.

   Sleepy Hollow isn't an âadaptationâ of Washington Irvingâs 1820 short
   story; it just takes and extrapolates themes, names, motifs and places
   from it. The cynic in me was initially tempted to conclude that the
   producers simply co-opted the title and elements for branding and
   marketing purposes. The consumer sees "Sleepy Hollow,â sees a few
   images, and they immediately know everything they need to know. Yet in
   skimming the old yarn anew, I saw something of our fraught and
   hyperbolic times, and in turn, made me admire the showâs choice to
   borrow from it, and more, made me wonder if -- much like the world of
   the show -- thereâs something sly and subversive under the surface of
   Sleepy Hollow. Irving tells the story of a community that resembles our
   culture in at least two ways: The people of Sleeping Hollow are coming
   off a dispiriting stretch of terror (in their case, the Revolutionary
   War) and enjoy amusing/abusing themselves with lurid h stories about
   ghosts and other ghouls passed off as real legends (think:
   found-footage horror flicks), like the one about a soldier who fought
   for the British and lost his noggin thanks to a cannonball and now
   rides the night searching for his head.

   (A possibly relevant aside: The Headless Horseman of the legend isnât
   English -- heâs a German mercenary, [43]a Hessian trooper. My
   continuing education tutor Wikipedia tells me these alien terrorists,
   these damn dirty foreign inglorious bastards, were well demonized in
   propaganda by pro-independence forces. Yeah, they were bad. But as bad
   as advertised?)

   The Headless Horseman represents a few different things that are
   meaningful and/or useful to Sleepy Hollow...or just strike me as fun to
   think about: 1. The creature embodies a history lesson about the
   evolution and spread of Gothic horror, which began with English
   Romantics under the influence of German and Eastern European folklore
   and spread Westward from there. Sleepy Hollow, then, could be as a
   meta-text about the horror genre; and 2. Heâs an incarnation of
   sinister Otherness. (But how much sinister?) In the pilot episode, we
   learn that this foreign agent is more than just a dirty foreign agent
   -- heâs one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Which is kinda
   funny. The British brought devilish ringers to the New World to help
   enforce their will in a dispute over tea tariffs? Learn the lesson
   here, kids: Taxation without representation is not just unfair, itâs
   downright satanic!

   Irvingâs Ichabod Crane was a romantic egghead, but also gullible and
   superstitious. He was a geek before geek was cool, and so a man ahead
   of his time. He had a blurry-eyed view of the facts and head full of
   fiction. Interesting, then, that Irving made this man a teacher, a
   shaper of young minds. Anyway, Ichabod's foolishness -- assuming it is
   foolishness -- doomed him: He mysteriously disappeared after an
   encounter with the Headless Horseman, who may or may not have been the
   townâs most popular cad, looking to punk the nerdy, nitwit who dared to
   make a move on his girl. The story is open to interpretation. We are
   left to assume that Ichabod went underground. But out of fear, or
   because he was, you know, killed and buried? Was Ichabod a victim of
   his own paranoia? Or was he the paranoid guy who just happened to be
   right for a change?

   While we may not be able to relate to his superstition, there are those
   who can surely connect with its modern articulation, The Conspiracy
   Theorist, a lunatic to most, an avatar of clear-eyed reason to himself.
   Encountering this kind of crackpot-or-not character in conspiracy
   fiction like Sleepy HollowÂ reminds us how our attitudes toward this
   archetype have shifted and become more complicated over the years.
   Once, he was a counter-culture hero. Jim Garrison in JFK. Fox Mulder in
   The X-Files. We loved those guys. Even if or when they were wrong, we
   loved their dogged quest for clarity and meaning.Â Now, we call these
   kind of people "Truthers." A bit harder to love, aren't they? Let us
   note hereÂ that until recently, Sleepy Hollow co-creator Bob Orci used
   his Twitter feed to question the official narratives of many recent
   historical events, including 9/11, which upset some of his fans. While
   it's valid to wonder if Truther skepticism inspires or informsÂ Sleepy
   Hollow, whether in a serious, self-deprecating, or even self-critical
   fashion, I have no opinion on Orci's politics (in large part because I
   really don't know anything about them), and I don't really have
   anything valuable to say about "Truthers." But I am not one of them. I
   do have an appreciation for conspiracy theories, fictional or
   otherwise. Not because they express my worldview or because I agree
   with them, but because I sympathize with the feelings that inspire
   them: Confusion and anger about random suffering and systemic
   injustice; suspicious that we're always being spun or lied to; that
   simple, reasonable, impossible want to know everything, for everything
   to make sense. But there is a cost to looking for conspiracies of
   meaning in everything, and I think it's the same cost that comes from
   believing everything you're told: Headlessness. Or: The dulling and
   collapse of reason. Perhaps The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is about this,
   too. There's a haunting bit at the end when Irving notes that after the
   disappearance of the schoolteacher-hero,Â  âthe schoolhouse, being
   deserted, soon fell to decay.â I infer something ominous and
   metaphorical in this -- something about a culture that has lost its
   ability to cultivate informed, discerning minds; that has a head foggy
   with strange fantasy, if it still has a head at all.

   With all of this as context, the pilot episode of Sleepy Hollow becomes
   a slightly more provocative read. [WARNING: SPOILERS ABOUND FROM THIS
   POINT FORWARD.] The sheriff, played by Clancy Brown in a meaty cameo,
   is a closet Fox Mulder: Heâs been investigating his townâs weird
   history -- clandestinely, of course, lest anyone think this publicly
   elected chief no longer commands his wits. He even has his own X-files:
   A locked cabinet stuffed with tales of the bizarre -- some linked to a
   scary spot in the forest that might be Ground Zero for Doomsday -- that
   have been suspiciously suppressed, explained away, or deemed nuts. You
   could see him a heroic skeptic. Whether or not the sheriff intended to
   act heroically on his knowledge or keep scared and quiet, we donât and
   wonât know: By the end of the pilotâs opening act, Sleepy Hollow kills
   him.

   Fortunately, the cause of 21^st century American enlightenment has
   another, more durable, bolder paladin, one that flatters geeks and
   conspiracy nuts alike. No longer the weak-minded New Yorker of Irvingâs
   story, the new model Ichabod Crane is a romantic hero, a strapping,
   morally sound stud. Heâs also British, as all great fringe-thinking
   detectives must be to be believed (kooky sounds more credible with an
   accent), a former redcoat who went native, turned rebel, and went to
   work for George Washington as a secret agent. Yet his mission was
   bigger, more cosmic than just helping the first Tea Partiers win
   independence: Apparently, our founding fathers -- all of them occult
   Freemasons, of course -- were actually laboring to stop a
   Biblically-tinged conspiracy to unleash Armageddon via demons like the
   Horseman. We meet both hero and villain in battle, killing each other,
   the Horseman gutting Ichabod, Ichabod beheading the Horseman. End of
   story? No. Just the latest in a series. Several score and a few years
   later, Ichabod -- gone to ground like his wimpier literary alter-ego,
   but for more noble reasons -- rises from his grave in a subterranean
   chamber; his eternal fate, it seems, is intertwined with the Horseman,
   who once again trots the earth. Sleeping reason roused anew to chase
   away his bad twin, a mounted nightmare of empty-headed insanity.
   Usually in these conspiracy thrillers, the hero spends the entire story
   or life of the series trying in vain to get the Powers That Be to take
   him seriously. Sleepy Hollow is Truther wish-fulfillment in at least
   this regard: By the end of the pilot, Ichabod pretty much has the
   police department and district attorney on his side.

   Before everything in Sleepy Hollow becomes defined by the mythology,
   which occurs by the end, the pilotâs symbolic language creates some
   familiar complaints about post-modern culture, that weâve become
   disconnected from traditional sources of meaning, for better and worse,
   in large part because theyâve lost trust or credibility. The Horseman
   beheads two metaphorically loaded archetypes: A cop (representing law
   and order) and a priest (representing religion). The assassinations
   (specifically the one against the priest) feel almost like furious
   judgments by the darkest of dark knights, and it got me wondering if
   this horrible harbinger might have more on his mind than making mayhem.
   Perhaps the Horseman isnât the terrorist bogeyman heâs presented to be,
   and nothing is what it seems.

   Unless it is.

   Madness.

   To bring this full circle, I'd like to see a smart, fun fantasy series
   that moves us beyond the usual apocalypse and conspiracy mythology
   andÂ the kind of dubious pathology it represents. And who knows? Maybe
   Sleepy Hollow can be that story by evolving in that direction. It could
   easily use all of its symbols and stuff to express the notionÂ weâve
   all kinda lost our heads with crazy thinking over the past
   whatever-many years, so to speak, and a better future depends on
   gaining a more clear-eyed, reasonable, meaningful understanding of good
   and evil, grace and justice, past, present and future. Â In other
   words: We need apocalypse, now. In the old school sense. We remember
   that âapocalypseâ is actually one of those words that has taken on a
   colloquial meaning (the end of the world) that differs from its literal
   meaning (a symbolic vision; a revelation). I do wonder --
   conspiratorially, I guess -- if Sleepy Hollow is playing knowingly,
   subversively with that word. Or not. We'll see.Â And so we watch Sleepy
   Hollow for fizzy, fright night B-movie fun, and like its heroes Ichabod
   and Abbie, we wait for a new apocalypse -- in more ways than one.
