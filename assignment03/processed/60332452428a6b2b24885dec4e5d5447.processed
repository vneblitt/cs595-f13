Summer Academy helps first-year students adjust to university life

   The transition to college is an exciting but potentially overwhelming
   experience for students. Increased academic expectations coupled with
   living life away from home can strain students and for some, start the
   university experience on the wrong foot.

   [83]Virginia Tech Summer Academy is designed to ease the transition
   from high school to college to increase students' likelihood for
   success. The program, which launched in summer 2012, allows first-year
   students to jumpstart their college careers by moving to campus in the
   summer, instead of waiting for fall, for a specially designed program
   of academic and co-curricular activities.

   the 2012 Summer Academy, shows pieces of her art to students. Jane

   Ashley Pierce of Newport News, Va., a first-year student majoring in
   animal and poultry sciences in the [84]College of Agriculture and Life
   Sciences, said without the program she may have struggled her first
   year instead of thrived.

A time for firsts

   If one adjective could be used to describe Pierce, "first" will
   suffice. "I'm the first one in my family to go to college and, beyond
   that, finish high school on time," Pierce said.

   At Virginia Tech, the firsts kept coming. "Everything I experienced in
   the Summer Academy, I never experienced at home. My mom is handicapped
   and money is tight. I did not get to experience what some other people
   have because of that," Pierce said.

   Even things many of us may not think about, such as a hiking trip, were
   all new experiences for Pierce.

   group from Summer Academy. Ashley Pierce poses for a picture while

   "I had never been hiking, and I never want to go again, even though it
   was a wonderful experience," Pierce said, laughing. "It really was
   beautiful up there. I did things through Summer Academy I never thought
   I would do."

Tough transition

   While "firsts" can be a good thing, the transition through the new
   experiences waiting for Pierce at college -- academically and
   personally -- was tough.

   "My high school experience was so easy and I didn't even realize it.
   Teachers held my hand along the way," Pierce said. "With college, you
   are the one responsible. Faculty members are willing to answer
   questions along the way, but ultimately, if you drop the ball, it's
   your fault."

   As a Summer Academy participant, Pierce enrolled in the nutrition and
   life sciences track to complete some of her major's requirements. A
   good student, Pierce was not expecting to begin her college career
   almost failing.

   "It was eye-opening for me," Pierce said. "People would tell me college
   is going to be totally different, but I did not realize how different
   until summer academy. I have never been this challenged before in my
   life. For me, it was about letting go of my pride and asking for help."

   With the smaller class sizes and extra academic support available in
   Summer Academy, Pierce got the attention she needed to turn her grades
   around.

   "What amazed me about Ashley was she did not give up," said George
   Simmons, Alumni Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the Department of
   Biological Sciences, who taught Pierce. "Her resiliency and
   perseverance is way ahead of an individual of her chronological years.
   When she rolled back onto campus in the fall and sat in the front row
   of my class, she was not a first-semester student. She knew what to
   do."

   Pierce also conntected with Karen Eley Sanders, associate vice
   president for student success. A faculty member recommended that Pierce
   contact Sanders to talk through some of her challenges. They have
   formed a mentorship relationship and get together regularly.

   "Ashley is one of the students I have `adopted' to make sure they are
   on a good path to graduation," Sanders said. "What we've found is that
   she is the typical first-year student and had the same anxieties. Just
   like any student, my team and I reached out to her to make Ashley feel
   comfortable and confident that there are many people at Virginia Tech
   who are here to make her academically successful."

Participation pays off

   Pierce's grit and determination during Summer Academy paid off in
   another unexpected way. She received a [85]Virginia Tech Presidential
   Scholarship Initiative award , which rewards and assists academically
   talented, low-income high school students from Virginia who demonstrate
   persistence and a commitment to academic excellence, despite adverse
   life situations.

   Typically, the awards are offered prior to enrollment. "She made
   connections through summer academy and proved herself," Sanders said.

   With financial concerns subdued, Pierce can focus on continuing success
   as a student, armed with the self-assurance she developed through
   Summer Academy.

   "Summer Academy gave me a starting point," Pierce said. "I knew where I
   stood versus the hundreds of other people in my first fall lecture
   course. I felt confident."

       tracks, with 35 options compared with the 13 offered in 2012.
       Colleges and faculty members expanded their offerings after
       response from the inaugural summer.
     * In addition to new freshmen, transfer students will be able to
       participate.
     * [88]Applications will be accepted starting Feb. 1, 2013, and

Summer session saves time, money

   The Virginia Tech Board of Visitors approved a [93]10 percent reduction
   for summer session tuition compared with regular session hourly rates
   beginning in summer 2013 on a pilot program basis. By taking summer
   courses, students make progress toward their degrees more quickly.
