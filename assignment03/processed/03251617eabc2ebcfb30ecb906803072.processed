SITUATION ANALYSIS AND NEEDS

   The violent conflict in Syria has been escalating in intensity and
   complexity since March 2011 with devastating humanitarian consequences.
   Recent estimates suggest over 100,000 have been killed[18][1], 5.1m
   Syrians are internally displaced[19][2] and 2.4m registered refugees in
   neighbouring countries[20][3]. In July 2013 alone, UN DSS recorded
   3,414 incidents of armed clashes and heavy weapons use in Syria (see
   map below). The extensive use of indiscriminate, area-wide weapons is a
   serious threat to Protection of Civilians, causing both immediate and
   long-lasting damage. These weapons result in Explosive Remnants of War
   such as rockets, cluster munitions and IEDs, endangering the lives and
   livelihoods of generations of Syrians if a rapid and concerted
   clearance effort is not undertaken in the immediate cessation of
   conflict.

UNMAS PLANNING and READINESS FOR RESPONSE

   With the necessary funding, UNMAS is prepared to instigate risk
   awareness programmes in Syria, aiming to reach particularly vulnerable
   groups such as frontline humanitarian aid workers, IDPs and children.
   UNMAS is currently working with partners in the region to provide
   coordination for the ERW Risk Education being carried out in Syrian
   refugee camps in Jordan and Iraq.  UNMAS is also seeking funding to
   further support and expand the Risk Awareness programmes in the
   bordering regions.

   After the cessation of conflict, ERW Survey and Clearance will be vital
   to enable recovery and reconstruction in Syria. Upon approval from the
   Syrian Government, UNMAS is uniquely placed to provide the specialized
   expertise, skills and equipment to respond to explosive hazards. UNMAS
   currently manages a database of Syria conflict data, in partnership
   with UNDSS and UN OCHA, to inform the current humanitarian response and
   enable pre-planning and preparedness for ERW survey and clearance at
   the appropriate time. As a result, UNMAS will be well-placed to provide
   holistic and comprehensive coordination to ensure maximum efficiency
   through appropriate task allocation and prioritization.

CHALLENGES

   The current operating environment in Syria is extremely challenging and
   the process of approving Government approvals for any activities is
   lengthy. Furthermore, the security situation is extremely restrictive
   due to continuous, intense fighting.

FUNDING REQUIREMENT

   UNMAS is included in the Syrian Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan
   (SHARP) 2013 with a project that would deliver Risk Awareness to UN and
   NGO aid workers and initiate a national capacity for delivering Risk
   Education to vulnerable communities. The amount required for this
   activity is $801,926 over six months.

   Current budget estimates for a rapid and effective humanitarian mine
   action response in a post-conflict Syria, including vital ERW survey
   and clearance, is $20m for the first six months. It will be crucial
   that funds are available for immediate disbursement and activation
   after the cessation of conflict and therefore donors are requested to
   consider supporting this through the UNMAS Rapid Response funding
   mechanism.
