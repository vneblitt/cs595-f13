A Library as Beautiful as the Bronx: NYC's First Municipal Green Building by

   ArchitectsI remember it vividly. It was the morning of January 17,
   2006, I was on my way to work--when an [128]MTA bus zoomed pass me. It
   was then I noticed it, on the side of the bus, a poster size picture of
   the building with the caption "A library as beautiful as the Bronx." I
   looked in astonishment, then with pride and joy as I recognised the
   building--it was where I was headed!

   Such was the start of the day which heralded the grand opening of the
   [129]Bronx Library Center and NYC's first municipal green building. At
   the end of the day, 6,000 people would have passed through its doors
   for the very first time as a city, a borough and a community welcomed
   and celebrated its new central library building.

   A few months later, the [130]US Green Building Council would present
   the [131]Bronx Library Center with the [132]LEED Silver Award--making
   it the first municipal building in New York City to qualify for and
   obtain such an award. I delight in seeing the look of amazement on the
   faces of library visitors each time I let them know that the [133]Bronx
   Library Center is [134]NYC's first municipal green building.

   The [135]Bronx Library Center is not only a leader in energy efficiency
   and sustainable design--it is a 21st century library in every way. As
   libraries are constantly evolving to meet the ever growing and changing
   needs of society--the [136]Bronx Library Center is reflective of this
   change.

   It is currently the only [138]New York Public Library location to
   comprehensively offer all of the following services and programs under
   one roof:

   5th Floor - [139]Career and Education Information Service: managed by a
   Career Coach. The department offers computers for job searching, resume
   creation, editing and posting. Over two thousand training videos from
   [140]Lynda.com can also be accessed on these computers. Individuals by
   appointment can have one-on-one job and educational counseling sessions
   with the Career Coach to get advice on their job search and entry into
   institutions of higher learning.

   On Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9-5, members of the public can have a
   one-on-one consultation with a Benefits Counselor from [141]Single Stop
   where they can determine if they qualify for any of the 40 goverment
   benefits and get assistance signing up for same. These run the gamut
   from unemployment insurance to SNAPS.

   [142]Photo credit - New York Times Photo credit - New York Times4th
   Floor - The Reference Department has a Reference Collection in English
   and Spanish and an extensive [143]electronic database collection which
   can be accessed on the 48 desktop computers available on this floor for
   public use. Or if you prefer to sit by the window, check out a laptop
   at the Circulation Desk. This floor also features a special rare Puerto
   Rican/Latino Heritage Collection in Spanish housed in a smaller room
   adorned with the artistry of Puerto Rican Heritage. In addition, there
   are smaller collections on [144]Bronx History and [145]Edgar Allan
   Poe's works, this great American writer whose cottage is a few yards
   away from the Bronx Library Center. There is also a circulating Spanish
   collection on the Latino experience, from which library users can
   borrow materials to take home. Tables and chairs for the serious
   scholars and lounge seating for the casual reader or those who just
   want to relax in a social space are available.

   [146]Photo credit - Dattner Architects Photo credit - Dattner
   Architects3rd Floor - The Adult Department has an extensive circulating
   collection in English--running the full [147]Dewey spectrum from
   computers, management, exam prep to cooking and travel books. For those
   who are most interested in the joy of reading, there is General
   Fiction, Mystery, Sci-Fic, Romance, Classic and for those who prefer to
   have the book read to them, check out an audio book and plop it into
   your CD player and shut out the world. If you are a digital reader,
   save the $10 for lunch and use your [148]library card to download an
   [149]e-book for free on your tablet or smartphone. Need help
   downloading? Ask a librarian for instructions.

   This floor has six computers and study tables and lounge seating for
   adults. It has a more quiet atmosphere where adults can have their own
   space. There are designated quiet zones for those who prefer the sound
   of silence. The daily newspapers and lots of popular magazines as well
   as some scholarly journals are available for in library reading. For
   those who prefer to read in their native language there are smaller
   collection of books in the following languages: Bengali, Chinese,
   French, Russian and Vietnamese. If you prefer to have the sky as your
   canopy as you relax or study or chat with a friend--use the outdoor
   reading terrace which is open on fine weather days.

   Floor - this entire floor is devoted to Children's Programs and
   Services. Books, dvds and other materials for children are available.
   The floor has a special area where parents with their toddlers can use
   age appropriate computers or crawl on the colorful rugs flanked by
   shelves of picture and board books. The older children have their
   section with computers and non-fiction and Fiction chapter books. A
   story hour room equipped to offer a variety of children's programming
   including a puppet theatre offers daily [151]programming for kids.

   1st Floor - this floor has the Popular Adult Library (New bestsellers,
   music cds collection, movie and documentary dvds, Large Print and Urban
   Fiction collections. It also has the Teen Center - where teenagers can
   be teenagers in their own space as they use teen designated computers
   and enjoy teen collections of books, dvds and music cds. Various
   [153]teen programs are held each week.

   In addition, the Circulation Department is located on this level, where
   you can get a library card, return or check out materials. This floor
   also sports a snazzy self-check machine and convenient book drops
   should you want to avoid waiting on line. This floor is more of a
   social space and it is okay to chat with friends without the fear of
   disturbing anyone.

   Concourse Level - A 150-seat auditorium offers [154]performances every
   Saturday at 2:30 pm. In addition, [155]lectures, [156]film and
   community forums are frequently held as well as [157]instructional
   workshops. Also, a computer lab provides over [158]30 basic computer
   classes each month. The Adult Learning Center also located on this
   floor offers a valuable Adult Literacy Program where adults learn to
   read and write as well as 10 [159]English as a Second Language classes
   each week during the Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall sessions.

   A permanent art work - The [160]DNA Representation of the Portrait of a
   Young Reader by Inigo Manglano-Ovallo, adorns one wall on this floor
   while the gallery space highlights rotating exhibits by educational and
   culutural institutions as well as local artists. Library sponsored
   resource fairs are frequently held in this space.

   The opening hours of 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Mondays through Saturdays, and
   Sundays noon to 6 p.m., all year round, is very convenient for students
   and workers on every shift.

   I recently attended a [161]Pew Research Center presentation on
   libraries and found that the public want their libraries to offer the
   following: (outlined in the Pew Research hyperlinked chart below).
   After carefully studying the chart , I though to myself--by jove, the
   Bronx Library Center has it covered.
