Is Living With Extreme Wildfires The New Normal?

   The Yarnell Hill fire in Arizona was deadly in part because of the how
   close a highly flammable forest was to a community. The U.S. once faced
   a crisis with structural fires, but managed to change regulations to
   turn the trend around. Experts say it will take a renewed effort to
   take on this newer fire threat.
