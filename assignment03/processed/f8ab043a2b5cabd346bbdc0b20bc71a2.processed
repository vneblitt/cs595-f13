   Whether you're a New Yorker unfamiliar with how to do research at the
   New York Public Library or visiting New York from outside of the state
   or country and need to use our research collections, we recommend
   familiarizing yourself with Library collections and services ahead of
   time. In many cases, you can request that items you need to consult be
   ready for you when you arrive!

5 Time-Saving Things You Can Do Before You Arrive

1. Get a library card.

   [128]third floor., Digital ID 465484, New York Public Library If you
   aren't already a New York Public Library cardholder, [129]apply online
   for a library card. Even visitors from outside New York can obtain a
   library card that offers temporary access to our collections. When you
   apply for a card online, you will receive a 7-digit temporary barcode.
   This allows you to set a PIN, place circulating items on hold or submit
   requests for research items from offsite storage. You'll need to
   complete your library card registration when you arrive and before
   consulting our materials (see further details below in the "Once You
   Arrive" section). Be sure to bring [130]proof of identity in order to
   obtain your library card!

2. Search the collections.

   Search for research items using our [131]online catalog. You can search
   by title, subject, keyword, etc. Note the location in the catalog
   record. The catalog includes collections held at all New York Public
   Library locations, so materials in the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building
   will have the location "Schwarzman Building" followed by the name of a
   particular [132]division. Other catalogs to search include:
     * [133]Archival Materials Database
     * [134]Prints and Photographs Catalog
     * [135]Digital Gallery

3. Consult with a curator or librarian.

     * Call, text, email, or chat with the [136]Ask NYPL service for
       general questions.
     * E-mail or call specific divisions. Contact information is found on
       each division's homepage.
     * If you need some extra assistance in getting started with your
       research, [137]make an appointment with a research specialist (at
       least 4-5 days in advance).
     * Most divisions welcome walk-in visitors, but some special
       collections require additional registration prior to your visit.
       Please consult the [138]list of research divisions and make
       arrangements in advance if required.

4. Place requests for materials stored offsite.

   The catalog record will indicate if an item is stored offsite. Using
   the temporary barcode provided when you applied for your library card,
   you may submit the "Request from Offsite Storage" form to have offsite
   items delivered 1-2 business days from the moment you submit your
   request. For most offsite items, you may also request a table of
   contents, single article, book chapter or index of up to 50 pages be
   [139]delivered electronically to your email address. Please note that
   upon delivery, offsite materials can only be used in the division they
   were delivered to, and cannot be taken out of the Schwarzman Building.
     * [140]Request Materials from Offsite

5. Place on-site items on reserve.

   You may also submit a request to have on-site materials in the
   Schwarzman Building's closed stacks retrieved ahead of time so they
   will be waiting for you when you arrive at the Schwarzman Building.
   Requested items will be held for you for 7 days. After the 7th day, the
   item will be returned to the on-site closed stacks.
     * [141]Advance Request Services

Once You Arrive

Check any items not allowed in reading rooms.

   Visit the no-fee checkroom at the 42nd Street entrance to check your
   belongings and pick up a Researcher Bag to carry allowed items.
     * [142]Checkroom Service

Pick up your library card.

   Visit the Library Card Services desk in Room 315 of the Schwarzman
   Building to pick up your library card. Staff will ask for [143]proof of
   identity and will process your new library card within a few minutes.
   Upon giving you your new library card, staff can direct you to the
   service or division you're looking for.
