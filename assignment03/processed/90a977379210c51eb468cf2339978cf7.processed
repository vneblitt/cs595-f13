Bruno Mars at the Super Bowl: Why choosing him makes good (business) sense

   There are still nearly four months left in 2013, but we already know
   what the most-watched musical performance of next year is going to be.

   time show
   [44][Bruno-Mars_100x100.jpg] Bruno Mars is not Jersey enough to play
   Super Bowl halftime, says Twitter
   [45]Cover Story: Bruno Mars Is Red Hot

   Over the weekend, the NFL announced that [46]the next Super Bowl
   Halftime Show performer will be Bruno Mars. He'll take the stage midway
   through football's championship game on February 2 inside MetLife
   Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey (home to both the New York
   Giants and the undefeated New York Jets).

   There are a number of names that were tossed out as alternatives to
   Mars, the most popular being Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and Jay Z.
   But there are compelling reasons for all three of those to be avoided,
   if they were even considered: Springsteen did the halftime show too
   recently (remember when he [47]crushed that camera with his crotch?),
   Bon Jovi seems to be in flux (who knows if [48]the Richie Sambora
   situation will be resolved by February), and Jay Z is way too
   polarizing for an event of this size and scale (even with his nods to
   big business, he remains too risky a figure for this stage as far as
   the check writers are concerned).

   Really, Mars is the biggest pop star to never have done the halftime
   show, save for maybe Taylor Swift (who seems like a lock to do this
   show some day). And his resumÃ© is chock full of qualifications for one
   of music's biggest gigs: He has two chart-topping albums, five Hot 100
   number ones, has shifted over 115 million singles, and has already
   performed on the Grammys, the VMAs, andÂ Saturday Night Live. He's a
   bona fide superstar, and yet the overwhelming reaction to the
   announcement that he got the gig has been negative: He's [49]not a
   representative of New JerseyÂ (or New York), he's simultaneously
   [50]too young and [51]too old; he's [52]too short.

   But really, the selection of Mars should not be surprising to anybody.
   The Super Bowl is, primarily, a massive business opportunity for
   advertisers, media outlets, corporate sponsors, and the NFL itself, and
   Mars represents a shrewd business solution: He's famous and an
   excellent live performer, but most importantly, he sounds like someone
   your mom would like.

   That last piece of criteria is the most important: Since the Super Bowl
   is the most-watched television event of the year (and many broadcasts
   have become the most-watched television eventÂ of all time, at the
   time), programmers have to assume that there are people watching who
   don't normally watch football and don't pay close attention to music.

   That's why the game itself is weighed down with non-sports-related
   tie-ins, why the commercials have been built into the entertainment,
   and why the halftime music tends to skew towards the broadest
   selections.Â

   Honestly, when was the last time you were truly moved by the halftime
   show at the Super Bowl? Outside of [53]Michelle Williams being shot
   into the air, can you recall anything from BeyoncÃ©'s performance at
   the last Super Bowl? (Even [54]these FCC complaints seem foreign now.)
   Save for [55]M.I.A.'s middle digit, is there anything that sticks from
   Madonna's performance the year before that?

   The last 10 years have been full of a lot of competent-yet-unremarkable
   performances by classic rock acts like the Who, Tom Petty, Paul
   McCartney, and the Rolling Stonesâbooking that was a direct reaction to
   the MTV-produced 2003 show that ended with Janet Jackson's nipple
   exposed and [56]clearly led to the end of civilization as we know it.

   So it's clear that the NFL, Fox (who is broadcasting this year's Super
   Bowl), and all the relevant sponsorship parties want to keep everything
   as even as possible, which probably means Mars' performance will be
   more [57]Grammy-centric than his [58]psychedelic fire-and-brimstone sex
   sermon from the VMAs. (And if he does sing [59]"Gorilla," it'll
   definitely be the radio edit.) It's a business decision, and a shrewd
   one at that: There are billions riding on the Super Bowl, and Bruno
   Mars is exactly the sort of artist that keeps all the check writers
   happy. He won't make you any money, but he also won't drive people to
   the [60]Puppy Bowl either.

   Here's one other point about the next Super Bowl Halftime Show: Since
   the show will be outdoors in February in New Jersey, how many people do
   you think said no because they don't want to perform in what will
   almost certainly be frigid conditions? [61]Sports writers are already
   complaining about having to work in the cold, and it's entirely
   possible that scenario drove away some potential names. (Singing live
   in cold weather comes with its own set of [62]well-known problems.)

   So who would you have booked for the Super Bowl Halftime Show? Would
   you have chosen some other pop star, somebody with more narrative ties
   to the New Jersey/New York area, or would you have preferred another
   dip into the classic-rock well? And how many of you wish the WWE still
   did Halftime Heat? Sound off in the comments below.
