                            [119]Adopt a Species

This is no ordinary camping trip!

   Imagine waking up to the roar of powerful lions or hearing the early
   morning call of playful gibbons. Come spend the night at the
   Smithsonian's National Zoo. It's the best way to see the Zoo's animals
   after hours and have the park all to yourself.

   Your overnight begins with a two-hour, keeper-led tour of an exhibit
   area. After that, flashlight in hand, take a hike through the Zoo in
   search of nocturnal animals. Then, fall sound asleep in your tent
   perched on Lion/Tiger Hill. In the morning, your adventure concludes
   with a breakfast snack and family-friendly activity.

   Snore & Roar overnights take place between June and September. A
   maximum of six participants may be signed up per registration. Large
   groups cannot be accommodated. Snore & Roar campers sleep in
   four-person tents provided by FONZ. Participants are never asked to
   share their tent with strangers.

Registration

   Priority registration for FONZ members with a Contributing or Premier
   Plus level membership begins on Tuesday, March 26 at 10 a.m.
   Registration for other FONZ members begins on April 2 at 10 a.m.
   Registration for non-members begins on April 16 at 10 a.m.

   [120]Register

Ages

   Adults and children ages 6 and up. A paying adult must accompany anyone
   under 18, and there must be one adult chaperone for every three
   children. Participants in adult-only overnights must be 21 or older.

Time

   6 p.m. to 9:30 a.m. the following day. A small snack will be provided,
   however participants should eat dinner before coming to the Zoo. All
   Zoo restaurants close at 5 p.m.

Cancellation Policy

   Cancellation requests received at least four weeks prior to the
   scheduled Snore & Roar will receive a 75-percent refund. Requests must
   be made via email. No refunds or changes will be made thereafter. Snore
   & Roars are a rain or shine event.

Snore & Roars are not just for kids!

   Adult-only programs include wine and cheese; a two-hour, keeper-led
   tour; flashlight tour of the Zoo; a breakfast snack; and engaging
   activity.
