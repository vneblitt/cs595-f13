   Opening Statement by Ms. Navi Pillay United Nations High Commissioner
   for Human Rights at the Human Rights Council 24th Session

   9 September 2013

   Mr. President,
   Distinguished Members of the Human Rights Council,
   Excellencies and Colleagues,
   Ladies and Gentlemen,

   Thank you for this opportunity to address you.

   In September two years ago, when I addressed the situation in Syria at
   this Council, I pointed out that some 2,600 Syrians had already died in
   the conflict.

   Today the number of dead stands at over 100,000. Last week the number
   of refugees reached two million, and an additional 4 million people are
   displaced inside Syria. Camps in neighbouring lands are struggling to
   cope and we are just a few months away from winter. The suffering of
   Syria's civilian population has reached unimaginable levels.

   The use of chemical weapons has long been identified as one of the
   gravest crimes that can be committed, yet their use in Syria seems now
   to be in little doubt, even if all the circumstances and
   responsibilities remain to be clarified.

   Mr. President, Excellencies,

   The International Community is late, very late, to take serious joint
   action to halt the downward spiral that has gripped Syria, slaughtering
   its people and destroying its cities. This is no time for powerful
   States to continue to disagree on the way forward, or for geopolitical
   interests to override the legal and moral obligation to save lives by
   bringing this conflict to an end.

   This appalling situation cries out for international action, yet a
   military response or the continued supply of arms risk igniting a
   regional conflagration, possibly resulting in many more deaths and even
   more widespread misery. There are no easy exits, no obvious pathway out
   of this nightmare, except the immediate negotiation of concrete steps
   to end the conflict. States, together with the United Nations, must
   find a way to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table and
   halt the bloodshed.

   Mr. President,

   While the world gazes in horror upon Syria, we must not forget the
   sometimes faltering efforts of other peoples, both in the Middle East
   and elsewhere, to assert their right to live in dignity, peace and
   security and full recognition of all their rights.

   In Iraq, human rights are under assault from a new wave of violence.
   The resurgence in the indiscriminate sectarian targeting of civilians
   is deeply alarming. This is not only because of the soaring numbers of
   killings - with more than 1,800 recorded deaths in the past two months
   alone -- and accompanying suffering, but also because of the impunity
   and lack of accountability for the perpetrators and the difficult
   challenges it poses to human rights and rule of law institutions. I
   call on the authorities to do the utmost to protect all people in Iraq,
   and urge it to ensure the investigation it has announced into the
   recent deplorable killing of at least 52 people in Camp Ashraf is fully
   independent, thorough and transparent. The authorities must take extra
   steps to guarantee the protection of the residents in both Camp Ashraf
   and Camp Liberty.

   Iraq has not yet responded to UN and international calls for a
   moratorium on the death penalty, and continues to periodically execute
   people in batches. A total of 123 prisoners were executed in 2012, and
   another 75 so far in 2013, despite the immense risk of miscarriage of
   justice as a result of systemic weaknesses in the criminal justice
   system.
   I remain alarmed at the continuing violence in Egypt, and call for
   independent and transparent investigations into all the killings and
   other violations that have occurred, both in recent weeks and in
   earlier periods. The path to stability in Egypt lies in its ability to
   establish the rule of law in an inclusive manner that ensures that all
   Egyptians, irrespective of their political opinion, gender, religion,
   or status, are recognized as legitimate stakeholders in the future of
   their country. I stand ready to support Egypt in efforts to guarantee
   the rights of all citizens. Last week I received the Egyptian Minister
   of Transitional Justice and National Reconciliation who conveyed
   Egypt's readiness to host an OHCHR regional office in Cairo and to have
   a technical team visit for this purpose. I will shortly be sending
   Egyptian authorities a draft agreement for the establishment of a
   regional office in Cairo. In the meantime I await a positive response
   to my request to deploy a mission to assess the situation at the
   earliest opportunity.

   I regret to report that the human rights situation in Bahrain remains
   an issue of serious concern: the deep polarization of society and the
   harsh clampdown on human rights defenders and peaceful protesters
   continue to make a durable solution more difficult to secure. I
   reiterate my call on Bahrain to fully comply with its international
   human rights commitments, including respect for the rights to freedoms
   of expression, peaceful assembly, and association. The cancellation of
   the scheduled visit of the Special Rapporteur on Torture is
   regrettable, and important recommendations made by the Bahrain
   Independent Commission of Inquiry have still not been implemented. I
   also wish to express my disappointment that the cooperation with the
   Government of Bahrain, which started fruitfully with the deployment of
   an OHCHR team in December 2012, has not developed further and an OHCHR
   follow-up mission has been stalled since then.

   The May-June events in Turkey underline the need to ensure more
   consistent protection of the right to peaceful protest, including
   freedom of expression and assembly, to refrain from excessive use of
   force by the police and to fully investigate all instances of such
   excessive use of force. I note the recent decision by the European
   Court of Human Rights concerning the disproportionate use of force by
   Turkish police, including the conclusion that the practice of firing
   tear gas canisters directly into demonstrators was unlawful. I urge the
   Government to seriously address the issue of policing, which has also
   been highlighted by international human rights mechanisms, and to carry
   out systemic reforms in this area with the support of the whole UN
   system, including my office.

   Excellencies,

   I am concerned about Israel's continued policy of forced evictions and
   demolitions, in at least six different locations in the past three
   weeks alone, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. In some cases,
   no alternative locations or housing options were offered. This may
   amount to a violation of the prohibition on the forcible transfer of
   individuals or communities under article 49 of the Fourth Geneva
   Convention. It may also contravene the prohibition on forced eviction
   under international human rights law and infringe the rights to
   adequate housing and freedom from arbitrary or unlawful interference
   with privacy, family and home.

   I am also concerned by the possible excessive use of force by Israeli
   security forces against Palestinian civilians during recent search and
   arrest operations in refugee camps in the West Bank, which since 18
   August 2013 has led to the death of five Palestinian civilians. I am,
   likewise, concerned by the possible excessive use of force by
   Palestinian security forces in the West Bank which resulted in the
   death of one civilian in Askar refugee camp, close to Nablus, on 27
   August.

   I would remind this Council that any use of force and firearms in law
   enforcement operations, anywhere in the world, must adhere to
   international human rights standards: it must be proportional to lawful
   objectives and the use of firearms must be limited to situations of
   self-defence or the defence of others where there is an imminent risk
   of death or serious injury, and only when less extreme means are
   insufficient to achieve these objectives.

   I am grateful to the Government of Sri Lanka for facilitating my recent
   comprehensive visit, which allowed me to assess the progress being made
   towards reconstruction, reconciliation and accountability in the
   aftermath of the war - as well as the broader human rights situation,
   including religious intolerance, governance and the rule of law. I will
   be reporting on my observations later in the session, but wish to
   stress my immediate concern for the protection of human rights
   defenders, journalists and communities I met during my visit from any
   reprisal, intimidation or attack.

   The Secretary-General's report on cooperation with the United Nations,
   its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights is
   before the Council at this session. It refers to cases of alleged
   reprisals, or intimidation, against persons as a result of such
   cooperation, from 16 June 2012 to 15 June 2013.

   During my visit to Colombia in July, I was moved by the calls of
   victims of human rights violations, indigenous peoples, Afro-Colombians
   and peasants, for equality in access to social, economic and cultural
   rights, for participation, and for their voices to be heard in the
   peace negotiations. President Santos is heading peace negotiations
   after 50 years of internal armed conflict and I welcome his commitment
   to draw on OHCHR support, especially in the establishment of
   transitional justice mechanisms in compliance with international
   standards.

   In South Sudan we continue to witness escalating levels of
   inter-communal violence and growing reports of human rights abuses
   against civilians caught up in the middle of fighting between the South
   Sudan army and rebel groups. The outbreak of fighting in early July
   between rival Lou Nuer and Murle tribes in Jonglei resulted in the
   killing of an unknown number of people, and the displacements of
   thousands of civilians. It is a cause for deep concern that the
   Government of South Sudan has taken so little action to protect
   civilians in vulnerable areas or to hold those responsible for the
   violence to account.

   I also urge the Government of Myanmar to address the ongoing challenges
   in Rakhine state, and other areas which have been racked by communal
   violence. These include ensuring accountability for human rights
   violations and eliminating discriminatory restrictions on freedom of
   movement for Muslim populations there. I encourage the Government to
   set a timetable for the establishment of an OHCHR country office.

   Turning to Tunisia, I strongly condemn the assassination on 25 July of
   Mohamed Brahmi, a leading opposition politician and member of the
   National Constituent Assembly. This was the third assassination of an
   opposition figure in ten months. The Government must take strong
   measures to show it will enforce the rule of law, and the people who
   carried out these crimes must be held accountable.

   Excellencies,

   Only a few days ago, the Deputy High Commissioner, Flavia Pansieri,
   returned from a visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She
   witnessed renewed fighting around the city of Goma, on 22 and 23
   August, and strongly denounced the indiscriminate bombing of civilians
   as a violation of international humanitarian law.

   The scale of sexual violence committed by armed groups, defence and
   security forces, as well as civilians, remains alarming, with many
   victims awaiting justice.

   There is some hope in Mali where, since the signing of the Preliminary
   Agreement on 18 June, allegations of grave violations of human rights
   have markedly decreased. I am heartened by progress in the restoration
   of peace.

   However, the human rights situation remains fragile in the north, with
   continued reports of summary and extra-judicial executions, forced
   disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention and looting of
   private property.

   Last month, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Ivan
   Simonovic, visited the Central African Republic and reported to the
   Security Council. I deployed a Fact-Finding Mission to the country from
   20 June to 11 July and will report to the Human Rights Council on the
   degradation of human rights in the CAR combined with the collapse of
   law and order and the ensuing climate of insecurity and impunity.

   Mr. President,

   The broad scope of national security surveillance regimes in countries
   including the United States and the United Kingdom, and the impact of
   these regimes on individuals' right to privacy and other human rights,
   continues to raise concern. Laws and policies must be adopted to
   address the potential for dramatic intrusion on individuals' privacy
   which have been made possible by modern communications technology.
   While national security concerns may justify the exceptional and
   narrowly-tailored use of surveillance, I would urge all States to
   ensure that adequate safeguards are in place against security agency
   overreach and to protect the right to privacy and other human rights.

   I am disturbed by the continued social exclusion and segregation of
   Roma in many European States. Alongside worrying reports about Roma
   increasingly becoming the targets of hate speech, demonstrations and
   violence by non-State actors, the authorities themselves have in some
   cases adopted policies that increase the vulnerability of Roma
   populations. I note with concern the findings of the report of the
   French Ombudsman in July that showed that forced evictions of Roma in
   France were taking place in ways that were incompatible with
   international standards and national legislation, and support the
   Ombudsman's recommendations.

   In similar vein, I also note and support last month's report of the
   Ombudsperson in Slovakia which identifies human rights violations
   committed by the police against the Roma inhabitants of a segregated
   rural shantytown. I urge both Governments to act on the recommendations
   of these reports.

   Migrants and refugees continue to be subjected to discrimination and
   xenophobia in many countries, with an alarming number of violent
   attacks on them occurring in Greece, where existing xenophobic
   tendencies have been exacerbated by the financial crisis.

   I also regret that Australia is re-imposing the discredited policies of
   transferring those arriving by boat to Papua New Guinea and other
   locations and I urge the authorities to respect both the letter and
   spirit of Australia's international obligations under the 1951 Refugee
   Convention.

   Many of the 215 million migrants in the world face particular
   vulnerability and abuse of their human rights in countries of origin,
   transit and destination. As such, we are working to ensure the
   integration of human rights norms and standards into all aspects of
   migration policy, at the national, regional and international levels.

   My Office helped ensure that a human rights focus was included in
   background documentation and discussions at the sixth Global Forum on
   Migration and Development (GFMD) held in Mauritius in November 2012.

   At the Secretary-General's request, OHCHR also led the preparation in
   2013 (in consultation with the Global Migration Group) of a report on
   Migration and human rights in preparation for the General Assembly
   High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development
   (September, 2013) where I have been invited to address the human rights
   of migrants.

   My Office has also advocated for inclusion of the human rights of
   migrants within the post-2015 development agenda and circulated a
   background note to the first thematic meeting of the GFMD in May 2013.

   Economic, Social and Cultural Rights

   For the past five years, our world has been suffering the effects of
   the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. As a
   result, today, millions are without decent work, adequate food, health
   care, shelter, and the safety net of social security - and thus without
   hope itself. Retrogression in the realisation of economic and social
   rights has reached historic proportions in some regions of the world.
   To be sure, the causes of the economic crisis are themselves human
   rights questions, representing as they do a gross failure of the rule
   of law in the financial sector and in the economic sphere more broadly.
   The impact of the crisis on human rights - were not inevitable, but the
   result of conscious policy choices - including the recent trend toward
   so-called austerity policies which adversely affect the economic and
   social rights of the most vulnerable communities, including the poor,
   women, youth, older persons, and persons with disabilities.

   OHCHR works to support the realization of economic, social and cultural
   rights through advice to governments, parliaments, the United Nations
   system and civil society. We provide technical assistance to
   governments, civil society and other national stakeholders, at their
   request, aimed at integrating human rights standards and principles in
   national development policies, poverty reduction strategies and budget
   processes for example.

   To these ends, our active advocacy contributed to the entry into force
   of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic,
   Social and Cultural Rights in May 2013. In Guatemala, following an
   OHCHR assessment of challenges faced by the General Labour Inspectorate
   to protect the rights of agricultural workers, the Ministry of Labour
   strengthened the capacity of that institution. We entered into a
   partnership with UN-Water to increase rights-based cooperation in the
   area of water and sanitation. And we provided technical assistance to
   UN-Habitat in human rights mainstreaming across its programmes.
   Throughout this period, we also produced a number of substantive
   thematic reports exploring the economic, social and cultural rights of
   specific groups, including persons with disabilities, children, and
   women, respectively.

   Last month, my office organized an expert consultation to discuss the
   legal obligations of member States to which the adoption of austerity
   measures should be subjected, particularly in relation to the right to
   social security.

   Increasing Food insecurity requires intensified efforts by developed
   and developing countries alike, to address short-comings in mitigation
   of food price volatility, global food distribution, and protection of
   the livelihoods of rural and urban poor. The Horn of Africa, the Sahel,
   Central and South Asia, and many countries suffering from austerity
   measures in Europe, are all facing food access challenges. It is
   essential that Member States renew their commitment to the right to
   food as a human right and embrace a human rights-based approach to
   nutrition and hunger as well as addressing structural causes.

   OHCHR is an active member of the High-level Task Force on the Global
   Food Security Crisis which has been focusing on the Secretary-General's
   Zero Hunger Challenge.

   I would also like to highlight another important aspect of
   discrimination, which is the alarming pattern of brutality and
   widespread intolerance against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
   (LGBT) people in all regions. In July, in Cape Town, together with
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu and South African Constitutional Court Justice
   Edwin Cameron, I helped launch Free & Equal, an unprecedented global
   public education campaign, to promote greater respect for the rights of
   LGBT people everywhere.

   Excellencies,

   Today I have put before you a selection of the current human rights
   challenges across the world. Many of them can be termed human rights
   crises, requiring immediate and resolute action. But we must also lift
   our aim towards preventing similar situations arising in the future.
   The independent regular review of States by the UN human rights treaty
   bodies is a key element of the international community's system for not
   only providing early warning of emerging human rights crises, but also
   for supporting robust national systems to avoid such crises emerging in
   the first place. To effectively fulfil this crucial function, the
   treaty body system requires not only the full engagement of Member
   States, but also adequate resources and the ability to adopt efficient
   procedures.

   I welcome the serious and constructive engagement by member States in
   the inter-governmental process in New York. Negotiations have reached a
   critical stage with the presentation by the Co-facilitators (the
   Ambassadors of Iceland and Indonesia) of draft elements for a
   resolution in the General Assembly. I believe that the current text
   contains all the elements necessary to make the Treaty Bodies more
   effective and sustainable.

   Mr. President,

   A few days ago the world marked the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther
   King's speech, "I Have A Dream." It set me thinking about how far we
   have come, and also how much further we need to go for racism to be
   defeated. Racism is now universally condemned, and a number of
   countries have adopted laws and policies promoting racial equality.

   But, far too many people are still victimized because they belong to a
   particular group - whether national, ethnic, religious, or defined by
   gender or by descent - and too many immigrants are denied equal
   protection.

   In July 2013, together with UNFPA and the Dutch Government, my Office
   organized the International Thematic Conference on Human Rights in the
   context of the ICPD Beyond 2014 Review process. The conference brought
   together a wide diversity of stakeholders to discuss the human rights
   agenda under the ICPD Programme of Action, and the discussions
   generated very important ideas about how to move this agenda forward.
   The ground-breaking agreement reached in Cairo is as relevant today as
   ever, and delivering on the human rights commitments associated with
   this agenda, particularly in the area of sexual and reproductive health
   rights, must be a fundamental part of our collective efforts towards a
   renewed development agenda.

   Right to Development

   In June this year I circulated an open letter to member States calling
   for a new universal, balanced and human rights-based development
   framework in the post-2015 agenda. I am pleased to inform the Council
   that human rights feature prominently in the report of the
   Secretary-General's High Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the
   Post-2015 Development Agenda.

   To help advance broader understanding of the right to development, we
   completed work on a landmark publication on the subject which will be
   launched later this year.

   The report of the Secretary-General's High-Level Panel contained a
   strong human rights focus, and the final UN Task Team Report called for
   a Post-2015 agenda based on "human rights, equality and
   sustainability." Later this year, the General Assembly's Open Working
   Group on the Sustainable Development Goals will dedicate a session to
   human rights, including the right to development, and has invited me to
   deliver a keynote presentation.

   Mr. President, Excellencies,

   I am gratified that human rights issues and considerations are growing
   as a central guiding element of UN peacekeeping, both at the planning
   stage and during mandate implementation. The Security Council has
   requested that peace missions systematically prioritize human rights
   protection activities in the deployment of capacity and resources.
   Despite critical security conditions in many areas of deployment, these
   interventions often save lives by deterring perpetrators and providing
   peacekeeping missions with insights into patterns of violence and
   needed preventive action.

   Mali provides a good example of this heartening trend, where human
   rights mobile teams have been dispatched to critical areas to document
   and analyse patterns of violence and advise MINUSMA and host country
   security forces on measures to prevent further violations.

   Elsewhere, as fighting between the M23 rebels and DRC armed forces has
   resumed in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUSCO human
   rights officers have increased field visits. They have extensively
   documented gross human rights violations, including at least 200 cases
   of sexual violence, and they have been at the forefront of developing
   mission strategies to protect civilians.

   For our part, we will continue to strengthen our engagement to develop
   policies and training that build peacekeepers' understanding of their
   human rights roles and responsibilities, including when they act to
   protect civilians who are under imminent threat of physical violence.
   OHCHR, DPKO, DPA and DFS have begun a thorough and extensive review of
   the state of implementation of a joint policy, issued in 2011, to
   extend human rights into all aspects of UN peace operations and
   political missions.

   Mr. President,

   This year, my Office has also contributed to UN efforts to ensure that
   alleged human rights violators - especially at the senior level - do
   not serve in the United Nations. This follows the adoption by the
   Secretary General of a "Policy on Human Rights Screening of UN
   Personnel" that applies to the entire Secretariat.

   I note with satisfaction the significant progress achieved in
   implementing the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy, or HRDDP, on UN
   support to non-UN security forces. I wish to reiterate that a
   consistent application of the HRDDP principles will bring important
   benefits to both Member States and the UN system.

   Finally, Mr President, I would just like to add that as Chair of the
   UNDG Human Rights Mainstreaming Mechanism (UNDG-HRM), we are assisting
   UN country teams all across the world to support Member States, at
   their request, in human rights strengthening.

   Thank you.
