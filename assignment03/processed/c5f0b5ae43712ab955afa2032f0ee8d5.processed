No Surprise Here: Leading Anti-Women's Health Politician Marco Rubio
Campaigns With Cuccinelli in Virginia

   Lately, Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli has
   been trying desperately to appear more moderate on issues important to
   Virginia women and our health -- most recently when he told voters that
   he has a "flat position" on birth control and that he won't touch
   contraception if elected governor in November. This would be a
   celebratory campaign promise, if it wasn't so misleading and
   contradictory to his record.
   The truth is, while serving in the state senate, Ken Cuccinelli
   co-sponsored a so-called "personhood" bill. If enacted, Cuccinelli's
   legislation could have interfered with a woman's personal medical
   decisions about birth control, access to fertility treatment,
   management of miscarriage, and access to safe and legal abortion.
   Cuccinelli was also the first attorney general in the country to file a
   lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act and argued that opponents of
   the law should be willing to "go to jail" to fight the benefit that
   requires insurance companies to cover the full cost of birth control,
   just as they would other preventive care.
   Cuccinelli's extreme record and agenda become clearer when we look at
   the company he keeps. He already has the endorsement of Rick Santorum,
   who once warned of the "dangers of contraception," and a leading
   anti-women's health organization announced they are spending over a
   million dollars to help him get elected. Instead of endorsing
   preventive measures that could reduce the need for abortions, the
   group's president has illogically argued that "contraception and family
   planning" are responsible for increasing the number of abortions. And
   now, we have learned that Florida Senator Marco Rubio will fundraise
   for Cuccinelli in Richmond today.
   Rubio and Cuccinelli share the same extreme ideological agenda, so it's
   really no surprise that Rubio would lend his support to Cuccinelli's
   campaign. After all, Rubio is the same politician who co-sponsored the
   much-talked-about Blunt amendment which would have allowed bosses to
   refuse to cover birth control in their health care plans. In July,
   Rubio published an op-ed in which he called the Affordable Care Act --
   a law that has already benefitted 765,000 Virginia women who are
   receiving preventive care like birth control and cancer screenings with
   no additional co-pay -- "disastrous."
   That's an A-list of supporters if you're a candidate hoping to outlaw
   safe and legal abortion and make birth control, the very thing that can
   prevent unintended pregnancy, less affordable and less accessible.
   Cuccinelli's record has shown, time and again, that when faced with the
   opportunity of trying to limit women's access to health care and make
   their personal decisions for them, he'll seize that chance. So we
   aren't fooled by Cuccinelli's attempts to appear moderate, and Virginia
   voters shouldn't be either. We know where he really stands -- just look
   at his record and the company he keeps.

   Hey liberals, this is a great pair, with a great plan. Golly, it's not
   like we have a 19th Amendment or anything. The goppers are overheard
   saying, "women can vote??????" "Who knew??" Obviously, not these two
   teakkklaners.

   The only fear I have with Cuccinelli possibly winning is that McAuliffe
   really isn't much better as a candidate (he's just extremely at the
   other end of things). Believe me, I know quite a few Republicans who
   aren't planning to vote for Cuccinelli here, the majority of them are
   planning a write-in campaign for Bill Bolling. Interestingly, most
   Democrats I talk to here would rather vote for Bolling than McAuliffe
   too.
   That being said, the important races actually are the Lt. Governor and
   Attorney General races this year. Because of the deadlock in the
   Virginia Senate over the last few years...the Lt. Governor will likely
   be a tiebreaker again. (And we can't afford someone as blatantly
   ignorant and divisive as E.W. Jackson as Lt. Governor.) While the
   Attorney General will handle cases for the Commonwealth. Even though I
   won't vote for Cuccinelli or McAuliffe, I am voting for Northam and
   Herring for the other two offices.

   Choice is the number one issue for me. My choice. It says everything
   about how women are viewed and treated. Are they viewed as competent to
   make their own choices, their own decisions or do a group of zealots
   feel the need to take over, control, and dominate women. I will not
   vote for ANY candidate who is not pro-choice and I am raising my
   daughters to do the same.

   There are militant groups who claim that "a culture of birth control
   leads to a culture of abortion."
   Some also insist that the common hormonal birth control pill is really
   an abortifacient. Some would ban all but barrier methods of
   contraception (condoms, diaphrams) and some would ban even those.

   used by women including Birth Control pills and IVF help for infertile
   couples.
   I was stunned the last few months to find out that this belief is more
   main stream with the conservative republicans than widely thought
   ,The REPUBLICANS understand how unpopular to say nothing of restrictive
   this belief is and therefore they keep it quiet ...........Make no
   mistake they against BIRTH CONTROL as well as believing in no abortions
   no exception even women's death rape incest.

   This should be a good indication of what is coming in 2014, in my
   opinion. Virginia could begin showing the rest of the nation the road
   back to progress, or we can show the nation just how far we've fallen.
   Maybe my fellow citizens will finally send a message to the Deceptacons
   that we're not interested in regulating one anothers' sexually habits,
   bodies, or lifestyles. WE are interested in better schools, better
   wages, building and maintaining our infrastructure and taking care of
   one another.

   None of us should believe any GOP candidate that says "they won't
   touch" reproductive rights if elected. That's exactly what the GOP
   governor in North Carolina said, who recently signed into law the bill
   that goes after reproductive rights.
   This is also why it's hard to imagine any current Republican winning
   the presidency in 2016. Rubio thinks he can become president, when he
   supports the likes of Cuccinelli? Someone should tell the Senator women
   can vote now.
