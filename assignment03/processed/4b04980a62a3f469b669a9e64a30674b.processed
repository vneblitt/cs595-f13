   Protesters [271]harassed retired Gen. David Petraeus before he gave a
   lecture at The City University of New York (CUNY), Mediaite
   [272]reported on Monday.

   The student activists [273]surrounded and followed the former CIA
   director as he walked down a street in New York City, shouting
   "Petraeus out of CUNY" and "every class, David," suggesting their plans
   to continue protesting his classes.

   As Petraeus crossed the street, a student yelled, "That's Petraeus,
   he's a war criminal!"

   "Disgusting, you should be ashamed of yourself," said another.

   Months after resigning from the CIA after evidence of an extramarital
   affair surfaced, Petraeus was [274]offered a position as a visiting
   professor at the Macaulay Honors College at CUNY.

   After word spread that the retired general was offered a six-figure
   salary, his pay was cut to one dollar to "keep the focus on the
   students, on the school and on the teaching, and not have it be about
   the money," [275]his lawyer said.

   General Petraeus is hardly a war monger. He is a distinguished warrior
   scholar. Do these swarmy and snarky little punks following him realize
   that, if he so desired, he could be on the lecture circuit earning
   millions of dollars?
   Peace through strength is the motto which will allow America to retain
   its preeminent position as a world power. Now is an opportunity to
   renew our economic progress and rebuild an America weakened by
   meaningless wars and leadership by feckless presidents.

   Shame on those students to treat and harass a US general who took an
   oat and risked his life to defend this nation and followed his
   commander of chief order.
   His personal life is his personal life, Do I agree with what he did,
   NO, but he does not deserve this kinda of attack and disrespect. Grow
   up and next time be more mature and courteous and raise your comments
   and questions with Respect. This not what American are made of. We are
   better than this.

   Let's see ... "heckle (verb) interrupt (a public speaker) with derisive
   or aggressive comments or abuse." ...
   or ... "bully (verb) to frighten, hurt, or threaten (a smaller or
   weaker person) : to act like a bully toward (someone)" - "bully (noun)
   a blustering browbeating person"
   With a man simply walking along a street being accosted by angry people
   yelling insults I'd say they are better defined as "bullies" and their
   behavior as bullying. It went beyond free-speech.

   I personally know of several soldiers who have degrees from
   universities. One, my nephew has a degree in geology had a job with a
   geological company. He decided to join the Army and selected the EOD
   PROGRAM, DISARM ANY TYPE OF EXPLOSIVE. So OhConservatives, why don't
   you admit that you are a Queen and the bravest and most strenuous thing
   you do all day is blog and relieve yourself.

   I think Petraeus was fired because he botched the CIA operation in
   Benghazi. He had PNAC people guiding him in AFG to lobby for the surge
   and I wonder if they came with him to the CIA. I don't think he is a
   traitor, but he's definitely a prime example of the Peter Principal.
   Not fit for duty. Hope his students really push him on his policies and
   insist on knowing who's really paying him.

   So, you don't think it is instructive to develop critical thinking
   skills especially when it comes to evaluating government policy? Do you
   think it might be in our nation's interest for young people to know
   what PNAC is and what they do and how they do it?

   F&F- Enjoyed the Book, The Peter Principal! However, In todays lingo I
   think people would not understand the definition. "Social studies on
   sex comes to mind."
   They probably think it means "keep it in your pants!" When it really
   means is "The last job you are ever promoted to, you are incompetent
   at! Becasue if were competent in that job, you would be promoted to the
   next level!!
