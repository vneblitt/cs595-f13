University to test VT Alerts on Blacksburg campus, six regional locations, on
Wednesday, March 20

   BLACKSBURG, Va., March 4, 2013 - Virginia Tech will conduct a
   full-scale test of its [160]VT Alerts system on Wednesday, March 20, on
   the Blacksburg campus and university facilities located in six regions
   across Virginia.

   The test will occur between 8 a.m. and noon.
     * Learn more about campus safety, emergency preparedness and
       response, emergency notification, and what is meant by
       "secure-in-place" and "shelter-in-place" by reading the [161]2012
       annual notice on campus safety, emergency notification reports
       online.

   The regional notification groups cover the following university
   locations:
     * Blacksburg (Virginia Tech main campus, Edward Via College of
       Osteopathic Medicine);
     * National Capital Region (Northern Virginia Center in Falls Church,
       Va.; Marion Dupont Scott Equine Medical Center in Leesburg, Va.;
       Middleburg Agricultural Research and Extension Center; Alexandria
       Center; Occoquan Watershed Monitoring Laboratory in Manassas, Va.;
       Advanced Research Institute in Arlington, Va.; Virginia Tech
       Research Center--Arlington);
     * Richmond (Virginia Tech Richmond Center);
     * Hampton Roads (Virginia Tech Hampton Roads Center; Virginia Tech
       Hampton Roads Center, Newport News);
     * Roanoke (Roanoke Higher Education Center, Virginia Tech Carilion
       School of Medicine and Research Institute);
     * Abingdon (Southwest Virginia Higher Education Center); and
     * Danville (Institute for Advanced Learning and Research).

   In the event of an actual emergency, individuals must be aware of their
   surroundings and take immediate responsibility for their personal
   safety and security. Initial VT Alerts messages will provide basic
   information on what to do; further instructions and updates will be
   provided by subsequent VT Alerts messages or first responders. In-depth
   information, when available, will be posted to the [162]university
   homepage.

   The university will use multiple information delivery methods to reach
   students, faculty, and staff because, at any given time, one form of
   communication might be better than another.

   VT Alerts will be utilized for the Blacksburg campus only in those
   instances when severe weather impacts class schedules and the opening
   or closing of the university.

   The university will test the following VT Alerts channels on March 20:
     * The [163]Virginia Tech homepage;
     * Broadcast email to all vt.edu accounts;
     * [164]@vtalerts Twitter account;
     * Electronic message boards in classrooms (Blacksburg only);
     * Outdoor sirens (Blacksburg only);
     * [165]VT Phone Alerts;
     * [166]VT Desktop Alerts (Blacksburg only).

Outdoor sirens

   Virginia Tech maintains six outdoor sirens that can be heard across
   campus as well as parts of the Town of Blacksburg adjacent to campus.

VT Desktop Alerts

   VT Desktop Alerts sends a notice to your desktop or laptop computer,
   wherever you are as long as you are connected to the Internet. Users do
   not need to be on the campus to download the application or to receive
   the alert. However, to activate this service, the VT Desktop Alerts
   application must be downloaded to your computer.

VT Phone Alerts

   VT Phone Alerts subscribers may receive text messages, phone calls to
   designated numbers, and/or email messages to non university e-mail
   accounts. VT Phone Alerts users will be able to identify the test
   message in the following way:
     * The subject line for the test message will be "TEST: VT Alerts."
     * The phone and voice mail messages will begin with "This is a test
       of the VT Alerts System."

   In an actual emergency, the message will appear as follows:
     * SMS (text) messages are from 89361 and start with "S: VT Alerts"
       (followed by the test message).
     * Phone messages are from (540) 232-1000 and begin with "The
       following is an emergency message from Virginia Tech." followed by
       a text-to-speech rendering of the message).
     * Email messages are from VT Alerts ([167]alerts-ins@cns.vt.edu).

   At the end of the message, you will be prompted to confirm receipt. For
   the purposes of this test, it is important for you to provide the
   requested confirmation, as that will be the only way the university
   will know if you received the message. Those who receive alerts via
   email will be provided a link to confirm receipt. When you click on the
   link, you'll be taken to a page hosted by Everbridge, the vendor who
   provides the VT Phone Alerts system.

   Because VT Phone Alerts is intended to communicate urgent information
   to students, faculty, and staff on campus during an emergency, it is
   important that each subscriber carefully consider his points of
   contact. If a user includes parents, spouses, or others among your
   points of contact, it is suggested that you list yourself as the first
   point of contact. To review your account, visit the [168]VT Alerts
   website and click on the "Manage Your Account" link.

   If you registered anyone other than yourself to receive these alert
   notifications via phone, text message, or e-mail, please inform him of
   the upcoming test.

   Individuals who do not have a Virginia Tech PID, but have a valid need
   to receive VT Phone Alerts emergency notification messages because of
   their relationship or proximity to the Blacksburg campus, may request a
   subscription through the Office of Emergency Management. [169]Learn
   more about this process on the VT Alerts website.

   If you do not receive a VT Phone Alerts message during the test, and
   you are subscribed to this service, please visit the [170]VT Alerts
   website and click on the "Manage Your Account" link to verify that your
   record is correct. If the information is correct, but you did not
   receive the message, you're urged to contact 4Help at (540) 231-HELP
   (4357).
