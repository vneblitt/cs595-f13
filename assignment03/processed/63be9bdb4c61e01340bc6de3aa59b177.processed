Deconstructing the ISS

   By Alberto Cuadra and Katie Park, Published Sept. 14, 2013

   The international space station has its origins in 1984, when President
   Ronald Reagan, in his State of the Union address, directed NASA to
   build a space outpost within the next 10 years. The actual assembly of
   the ISS did not start until 1998, and all its main components were not
   in place until 2011. The ISS is an unprecedented feat of engineering,
   but its utility as an orbital research facility has been questioned
   because of its enormous maintenance costs: $3 billion every year.

   2011

   Final touches

   By 2011, all the stationâs main habitable components have been
   installed, as well as its full array of power cells. The station relies
   mainly on Russian Soyuz capsules to receive new supplies and crews.

   Columbus

   The European laboratory module has a projected life span of 10 years
   and is the biggest contribution of the E.U. to the station.

   Kibo

   The Japanese pressurized module is Japanâs first human space facility.
   The orbital laboratory consists of two pressurized modules, an exposed
   facility for experiments in the vacuum of space, and its own robotic
   arm.

   Robonaut 2

   A humanoid robotic torso designed to assist the crew during spacewalks
   with the manipulation of small pieces of hardware.

   2008

   The last pieces

   Following the space shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, construction of
   the station is halted. The assembly of the station resumes in 2006. By
   2008, most of the main components of the space outpost are in place.

   Harmony

   A vital connecting corridor between the research laboratories of the
   station: Destiny (U.S.), Columbus (European Union) and Kibo (Japan).
   Harmony is installed in the space station in 2007, ahead of the
   aggregation of the Japanese and European modules.

   Integrated truss structure (ITS)

   The backbone of the space station, the truss is divided into 12
   segments with the designation S and P (starboard and port). The ITS
   holds the majority of the solar cells that provide power to the
   station, with a total surface of 38,000 square feet, the equivalent of
   eight basketball courts. The truss is the longest man-made structure
   ever put in space.
   [module-2008b.png]

   Solar cells

   Each solar array wing (SAW) contains two retractable structures, each
   115 feet long, with a mast in between them. Each wing uses nearly
   33,000 cells. The eight wings generate a total of 84 kilowatts.

   2002

   Rapid growth

   Four years after its first component was put into orbit, the station is
   capable of sustaining a permanent crew of three and has its first
   research module, the U.S. laboratory known as Destiny.

   Destiny

   The primary research facility for U.S. experiments and the first
   permanent operating orbital research station since Skylab in 1974.
   Built by Boeing, this 16-ton laboratory is attached to the station in
   2001.
   [module-2002a.png]

   Zvezda (Star)

   Installed in July 2000, Russiaâs service module provides the stationâs
   first living and lab quarters.
   [module-2002b.png]

   1998

   Fully energized

   The first module of the international space station is the
   Russian-built Functional Cargo Block, also known as Zarya (Sunrise).
   This component gives the space outpost its initial power, storage and
   propulsion capabilities

   Zarya (Dawn)

   Originally designed as a module for the Russian space station Mir. The
   module has three docking points and plays a vital role during the early
   stages of the stationâs assembly.

   (Sunrise).

   Dec. 4, 1998

   Unity, the first U.S.-built component of the station, launches with the
   first space shuttle mission dedicated to the assembly of the outpost.

   Oct. 2, 2000

   Astronaut Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei
   Krikalev become the first crew members aboard the station. They stay in
   space for several months.

   Nov. 30, 2000

   The P6 truss is installed. This component includes the first piece of
   the main solar-cell array that powers the station.

   Feb. 7, 2001

   Destiny, the U.S. laboratory module, becomes part of the station.
   Destiny is still the primary research facility for U.S. payloads.

   April 19, 2001

   Canadarm2, the station's robotic arm, is added. The robotic system
   plays a key role in the assembly of the station.

   April 8, 2002

   The central segment of the station truss, S0, is installed on top of
   Destiny.

   Feb. 1, 2003

   The space shuttle Columbia disintegrates during atmospheric reentry.
   The construction of the station is halted.

   Construction halted: 2003 - 2006

   During the space shuttle moratorium (2003 to 2006) and after the end of
   the program, the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TMA became the main transport
   to the station. The capsule has more than 47 years of service with the
   same basic design.

   truss segment, S6, and its final pair of power-generating solar array
   wings.

   Nov. 2, 2010

   The station celebrates the 10-year anniversary of its continuous human
   occupation. Since Expedition 1 in the fall of 2000, 202 people have
   visited the station.

   Feb. 24, 2011
   [illo-shuttle.png]

   The space shuttle Discovery launches on its final planned mission to
   deliver the Permanent Multipurpose Module, Leonardo, and Express
   Logistics Carrier 4 to the international space station, as well as
   equipment and supplies. Among the cargo aboard Leonardo was Robonaut 2,
   a robot that could be a precursor of new humanoid remote devices to
   help during spacewalks.
