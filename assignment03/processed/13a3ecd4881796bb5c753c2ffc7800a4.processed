Overhaul of MLK Library Draws Dozens of Interested Architects

   Posted by [86]Aaron Wiener on Sep. 10, 2013 at 3:45 pm
   More than a few architects are interested in taking on the daunting
   task of redesigning the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library.

   More than a few architects are interested in taking on the daunting
   task of redesigning the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library.

   A few weeks ago, I wrote about the [87]daunting task facing architects
   interested in overhauling the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library.
   The 1972 building, designed by renowned modernist Ludwig Mies van der
   Rohe, is a historic landmark, meaning that its basic elements must be
   left intact. Yet it's also outdated and fairly unpleasant, and in need
   of a substantial upgrade--but any changes have to go through a "very
   complex" design review process, according to D.C. Public Library's
   solicitation for architects. Oh, and DCPL doesn't actually have any
   specifications in mind yet.

   No matter: Architects appear to be undaunted. At this morning's
   pre-response conference for interested developers and architects to
   learn more about the project, 98 people representing 63 firms showed
   up, according to DCPL spokesman George Williams.

   I wasn't present; I was covering a [88]certain real estate
   magnate-turned-TV personality's grand unveiling of his plans for a
   downtown luxury hotel. But according to Williams, companies from as far
   as London, Canada, New York, Boston, and Chicago came to this morning's
   meeting. Williams says firms from Tel Aviv and Jordan have also made
   inquiries to DCPL about the project.

   The deadline for interested architects to submit their qualifications
   is Sept. 23. Within 60 days afterward, DCPL will invite 10 to 15 of
   those architects or teams to present more detailed proposals.

       If we don't get a handle on the rampant use of the space for
       homeless encampments it doesn't really matter how many millions we
       throw at redesign - it'll still be unpleasant and underused.

       @Hillman
       You mean it's not a shelter? Then why do all the transports drop
       off folks every morning and pick them up every night? Seems like a
       shelter to me...
