NASA confirms Voyager 1 has left the solar system

   Voyager 1, a probe launched in the 1970s to study the outer edges of
   the solar system, has traveled far enough to leave the influence of the
   sun.
   By Monte Morin

   1:00 p.m. CDT, September 12, 2013

   After 36 years of space travel and months of heated debate among
   scientists, NASA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 has indeed left our
   solar system and had entered interstellar space more than a year ago.

   "Voyager has boldly gone where no probe has gone before, marking one of
   the most significant technological achievements in the annals of the
   history of science," said John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate
   administrator for the Science Mission Directorate.

   At a Thursday [128]news conference in Washington, D.C., officials said
   the belated confirmation was based on new "key" evidence involving
   space plasma density. The evidence was outlined in a paper published
   online Thursday in the journal [129]Science.

     * [133]Has Voyager 1 left the solar system yet? A debate rages

   Lead author Don Gurnett, an Iowa State plasma physicist and a Voyager
   project scientist, said the data showed conclusively that Voyager 1 had
   exited the heliopause -- the bubble of hot, energetic particles that
   surrounds our sun and planets -- and entered into a region of cold,
   dark space called the interstellar medium.

   "When we got that data, I and my colleagues just looked at each other
   and said, 'We're in the interstellar medium.' It was just that clear to
   us," Gurnett said.

   Gurnett calculated that Voyager crossed the edge of the heliosphere, or
   heliopause, at or around Aug. 25, 2012.

   "Even though it took 36 years, it's just an amazing thing to me," said
   study coauthor Bill Kurth, a radio and plasma researcher at the
   University of Iowa.

   Scientists had begun to vigorously debate Voyager's whereabouts earlier
   this year, when it was clear that the probe was being bombarded by an
   increasing number of galactic cosmic rays and that the number of
   high-energy particles from inside the heliosphere had plummeted.
   However, NASA scientists said they could not be certain Voyager had
   left the solar system until surrounding magnetic fields changed
   direction. After waiting for that change for more than a year, however,
   officials conceded that the magnetic field change was not a necessary
   indicator.
   "It's a big surprise, and it's another mystery," said Ed Stone, a
   Voyager project scientist at Caltech and former chief of the Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge. "This is not what our
   models were telling us. We have to address this issue, but right now
   ... we don't understand."
   Confusion over Voyager's whereabouts has a lot to do with the failure
   of one specific piece of equipment, the spacecraft's plasma science
   experiment, or PLS. The device, which was developed at MIT, measures
   the electron density of space plasma: ionized gas that is ejected from
   our sun as well as other stars.
   Cool plasma, the product of stars that exploded millions of years ago,
   populates interstellar space and has a high density: about 100,000
   electrons per cubic yard of space. Super-heated plasma, like the solar
   wind that flows from our sun, fills the heliosphere and is much less
   dense, only about 1,000 electrons per cubic meter, Gurnett said.

   A functioning PLS would have been able to sense the rising density
   change as Voyager exited the heliosphere.
   "The instrument failed in 1980, so the spacecraft is sort of
   instrument-challenged," Gurnett said. "That's really one of the major
   failures we've had. There really aren't that many."
   Voyager does, however, have two plasma wave antennas that stretch from
   its base in a wide V shape. The antennas, which are connected to a
   radio transmitter, detect the oscillation, or vibration, of excited
   plasma particles. The device will convert the oscillations into an
   audible noise that is recorded on Voyager's vintage eight-track tape
   recorder.

   The frequency of the noise is associated with a specific density of
   plasma. The higher the frequency, the denser the plasma.
   The only trouble is that something has to excite the plasma for it to
   "ring," something like a large solar flare. Waiting for a solar flare
   can take years during a solar minimum (a period of low solar activity).
   Also, when a flare does occur, it can take as long as a year for the
   shock wave to reach Voyager 11.6 billion miles away.
   Fortunately for Voyager scientists, the antennas picked up two
   long-lasting oscillations. The first was in October and November of
   2012 and the second was in April and May of 2013. In both cases, the
   frequency suggested that the plasma was cold and dense. Voyager was in
   interstellar space.
   "It was key evidence," Stone said. "We really needed to measure plasma
   to know if we were inside or outside the heliosphere. Everything else
   is more of a proxy."
   Gurnett and his colleagues arrived at the crossing date of Aug. 25 by
   extrapolation.
   Plasma density was increasing in a linear fashion as Voyager moved
   further from the heliosphere and into the interstellar medium. The
   frequency measured in the fall of 2012 was 2.2 kilohertz, and by the
   spring of 2013 it had risen to 2.6 kilohertz. Previous research told
   Gurnett that the frequency of the radio signal at the crossing point
   should be 2 kilohertz, and so by plotting each point on a line, he was
   able to arrive at a date.

   Scientists are hoping that many gaps in our understanding will be
   filled in by Voyager 2. The sister spacecraft, which was also launched
   in 1977, is nearing the edge of the heliosphere via a different path
   and is expected to encounter interstellar space sometime within the
   next several years.
   Unlike Voyager 1, however, Voyager 2 has a fully functioning plasma
   science instrument and has been sending back density readings
   throughout its journey.
   "I think it's going to teach us even more about this region," Stone
   said.
