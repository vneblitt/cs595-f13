Library of Congress Announces a Season of Extraordinary Artists

2013-2014 Season Includes Oliver Knussen, Rosanne Cash, Randy Newman

   The 2013-2014 Concerts from the Library of Congress lineup will exhibit
   a wide range of programming this season, offering free concerts of
   world-class chamber music, jazz, bluegrass, country, American music
   theater, pop, rock and electronica. The concerts are complemented by
   guest speakers, curators, panels, film screenings and displays of
   rarely seen manuscripts, letters and memorabilia from the Libraryâs
   holdings. Concerts kick off Saturday, Oct. 5, at 8 p.m. with a
   performance by Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Randy Newman.

   The Libraryâs 88th concert season celebrates American history and
   culture through performances by some of the nationâs most eloquent
   musicians, including Rosanne Cash, who comes to the Library for a
   three-day residency that includes a live debut of her new album "The
   River and the Thread," and a conversation with Natasha Trethewey, U.S.
   Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry. Other highlights, continuing the
   Libraryâs "Songs of America" project begun last season, include
   appearances by bluegrass duo Dailey & Vincent, the Steep Canyon
   Rangers, Gregory Porter, and a special talk by rock legend Graham Nash
   about his new autobiography, available for purchase at the Library a
   day before it is released worldwide.

   The Library commemorates the 200th birthdays of Giuseppe Verdi and
   Richard Wagner with a special series of performances and films that
   feature re-imaginings of their work. Preeminent scholar Alan Walker
   joins pianist Valerie Tryon in a talk and performance about Wagner and
   Verdi transcriptions and paraphrases, including some on display from
   the Libraryâs collections. Acclaimed author Alex Ross will explore
   Wagnerâs connections to America and African-American Wagnerism. Two
   films will be screened as part of this special series, including the
   U.S. premiere of "Richard Wagner: Venetian Diary of the Rediscovered
   Symphony," which draws on music held at the Library of Congress.

   Contemporary music is highlighted this season with major new
   commissions and performances by leading ensembles. Renowned composer
   and conductor Oliver Knussen is in residence for a week of performances
   by the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group and "The Presidentâs Own"
   United States Marine Band.

   Numerous special projects illuminate a variety of topics, including the
   first in a projected series of Music and Technology talks presented in
   collaboration with Stanford University. Other special projects include
   a vocal recital featuring Italian-American composer Mario
   Castelnuovo-Tedescoâs settings of poetry by Walt Whitman; a roundtable
   discussion about the music that came to shape American culture during
   the 1960s, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on
   Washington; a "correspondence" course by author Nigel Simeone, author
   of "The Leonard Bernstein Letters"; a special July program for
   educators by Thomas Hampson titled "Poets and Patriotism: The 200th
   Birthday of the Star-Spangled Banner"; and a birthday bash panel
   discussion on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Blue Note
   Records label.
