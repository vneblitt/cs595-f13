Professor seeks way to limit concussions on the football field

   Stefan Duma loves football. He tracks play calls and watches stand-out
   plays from games, sometimes on frame-by-frame playback. He examines
   defensive alignments and blocks, predicting the next move or wondering
   where a referee's call went so right or so wrong.

   "If you ever watch a game with me, you will never see football the same
   again," Duma said.

   Whether college or pro football, he also watches games for the helmets
   worn by the players: Brand, model number, and whether they are securely
   fastened onto the player's head.

   Tackles and their consequences on the body has been a focal point of
   Duma's research for a decade as a professor of biomedical engineering
   and department head of the [83]Virginia Tech-Wake Forest University
   School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences. The results have brought
   media attention from around the world.


   From left, Ray Daniel, Steven Rowson, and Stefan Duma test football
   helmets From left, Ray Daniel, a doctoral candidate in the Virginia
   Tech-Wake Forest University School of Biomedical Engineering and
   Sciences; Steven Rowson, an assistant professor in the school; and
   Stefan Duma, the Harry C. Wyatt Professor of Engineering and department
   head of the school, test football helmets to reduce the risk of
   concussions of players.

   Duma's work is dedicated to realizing better-designed football helmets
   that can reduce injuries. Skull fractures already are well prevented by
   helmets, but concussions are Duma's immediate concern. Long-term,
   repetitive injuries can dibilitate or eventually kill a player years
   after play.

   Duma uses both on-field real-time sensors installed in the helmets of
   several dozen players to study injuries and a lab-tested five-star
   rating system to track and grade commercially sold helmets. The former
   can help indicate head injuries that require immediate attention. The
   latter has provided the only independent biomechanical data for
   consumers to make helmet purchasing decisions, Duma said.


   Each Hokie football helmet outfitted by Stefan Duma's research team
   includes 12 accelerometers and a wireless transmitter. Each Hokie
   football helmet outfitted by Stefan Duma's research team includes 12
   accelerometers and a wireless transmitter that can send hit data to a
   nearby laptop that is monitored during practices and games.

   He and Steve Rowson, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering
   and co-principal investigator in the research effort, have been working
   with Virginia Tech's football team since 2003. From the athletic side
   of the research, Gunnar Brolinson, the team's lead doctor, and Mike
   Goforth, the team's lead trainer, have been vital in collecting and
   studying data on player hits and improve team safety. As of January
   2013, more than 150,000 hits have been recorded in detail from hundreds
   of players at every practice and at every game, Duma said.

   The sensors installed in the Hokie player helmets are part of the HIT
   -- short for Head Impact Telemetry -- System, an array of accelerators
   fitted closest to the head. Developed by New Hampshire tech company
   SIMBEX LLC, the accelerators record the angle of the hit and measure
   the gravitational pull when a player is struck or his head is violently
   throttled during a play.

   The data is sent wirelessly to a laptop manned by Hokie medical
   trainers. Medical staff is automatically alerted if a hit reaches
   concussion territory. After the play in question, "we can talk to the
   player and see if he is showing signs of a concussion," said Brett
   Griesemer, assistant athletic trainer.

   Virginia Tech was the "first team in the country and the first team
   ever to have helmets fitted with sensors that allowed us to measure, in
   real time and on the field, the head accelerations [of] the players,"
   Brolinson said. "Nobody ever had done this before. Not NFL. Not college
   sports."

   Duma and his collaborators have seen their work grown far past Hokie
   football to include a local grade school to test those ages 6 to 8 as
   they play, as well as young athletes near Wake Forrest, N.C, where the
   School of Biomedical Engineering has faculty. A study headed by Duma
   concerning head impacts among pee-wee players was featured in a special
   report by former "Dateline NBC" reporter Stone Phillips on an episode
   of "The View." Research involving helmets also has moved to ice hockey
   and baseball.


   The HIT System can track all the head impacts a player receives during
   the course of a season. The HIT System can track all the head impacts a
   player receives during the course of a season. Each strand marks a spot
   where a player has received a hit, with longer strands marking spots
   that were hit repeatedly during a set period.

   As of early 2013, the NFL is slow to accept the use of the sensors on
   the field. ESPN has thrown its support behind Duma's work. In an August
   2012 story, the sports news giant wrote, "The Hokies have built one of
   the best football programs in the country. But the school's highly
   regarded Department of Biomedical Engineering might go down in history
   as having made a more important contribution to the game."

   Duma and Brolinson know the risk of injury, especially concussions, can
   never be fully eliminated from the sport. It's part of the risk player
   willing take when they step onto the field. That doesn't mean some
   instances cannot be lessened and some actions -- say, direct helmet to
   helmet contacts -- discouraged.

   "Really, the helmet is the last line of defense," Brolinson said.
   "Making sure the players are educated about the signs and symptoms of
   concussions is important. It's important to teach coaches, players,
   parents, and students, too."

Who is Stefan Duma?

       Stefan Duma tests helmets in his sports biomedical engineering lab
   at the Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science.

   [87]Stefan Duma is professor and head of the [88]Virginia Tech-Wake
   Forest University School of Biomedical Engineering and Science, and
   interim head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering.

   In addition to his research of sports safety, he has researched
   [89]injuries suffered by pregnant women in vehicle crashes, the
   biomechanics of [90]eye injuries, and the [91]biomechanics of blast
   injuries suffered by the military. He also is the founding director of
   [92]Virginia Tech's Center for Injury Biomechanics and has received
   more than $35 million in research funds from federal agencies.

   In 2012, he was named the [93]Harry Wyatt Professor in Engineering and
   was a co-winner of the 2012 Brain Trauma Foundation Award.
