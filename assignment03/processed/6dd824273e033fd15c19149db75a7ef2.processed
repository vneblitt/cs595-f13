   NASA Spacecraft Embarks on Historic Journey Into Interstellar Space

   PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft officially is the first
   human-made object to venture into interstellar space. The 36-year-old
   probe is about 12 billion miles (19 billion kilometers) from our sun.

   New and unexpected data indicate Voyager 1 has been traveling for about
   one year through plasma, or ionized gas, present in the space between
   stars. Voyager is in a transitional region immediately outside the
   solar bubble, where some effects from our sun are still evident. A
   report on the analysis of this new data, an effort led by Don Gurnett
   and the plasma wave science team at the University of Iowa, Iowa City,
   is published in Thursday's edition of the journal Science.

   "Now that we have new, key data, we believe this is mankind's historic
   leap into interstellar space," said Ed Stone, Voyager project scientist
   based at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. "The Voyager
   team needed time to analyze those observations and make sense of them.
   But we can now answer the question we've all been asking -- 'Are we
   there yet?' Yes, we are."

   Voyager 1 first detected the increased pressure of interstellar space
   on the heliosphere, the bubble of charged particles surrounding the sun
   that reaches far beyond the outer planets, in 2004. Scientists then
   ramped up their search for evidence of the spacecraft's interstellar
   arrival, knowing the data analysis and interpretation could take months
   or years.

   Voyager 1 does not have a working plasma sensor, so scientists needed a
   different way to measure the spacecraft's plasma environment to make a
   definitive determination of its location. A coronal mass ejection, or a
   massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields, that erupted from the
   sun in March 2012 provided scientists the data they needed. When this
   unexpected gift from the sun eventually arrived at Voyager 1's location
   13 months later, in April 2013, the plasma around the spacecraft began
   to vibrate like a violin string. On April 9, Voyager 1's plasma wave
   instrument detected the movement. The pitch of the oscillations helped
   scientists determine the density of the plasma. The particular
   oscillations meant the spacecraft was bathed in plasma more than 40
   times denser than what they had encountered in the outer layer of the
   heliosphere. Density of this sort is to be expected in interstellar
   space.

   The plasma wave science team reviewed its data and found an earlier,
   fainter set of oscillations in October and November 2012. Through
   extrapolation of measured plasma densities from both events, the team
   determined Voyager 1 first entered interstellar space in August 2012.

   "We literally jumped out of our seats when we saw these oscillations in
   our data -- they showed us the spacecraft was in an entirely new
   region, comparable to what was expected in interstellar space, and
   totally different than in the solar bubble," Gurnett said. "Clearly we
   had passed through the heliopause, which is the long-hypothesized
   boundary between the solar plasma and the interstellar plasma."

   The new plasma data suggested a timeframe consistent with abrupt,
   durable changes in the density of energetic particles that were first
   detected on Aug. 25, 2012. The Voyager team generally accepts this date
   as the date of interstellar arrival. The charged particle and plasma
   changes were what would have been expected during a crossing of the
   heliopause.

    "The team's hard work to build durable spacecraft and carefully manage
   the Voyager spacecraft's limited resources paid off in another first
   for NASA and humanity," said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager,
   based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. "We expect
   the fields and particles science instruments on Voyager will continue
   to send back data through at least 2020. We can't wait to see what the
   Voyager instruments show us next about deep space."

   Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched 16 days apart in 1977.
   Both spacecraft flew by Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 also flew by
   Uranus and Neptune. Voyager 2, launched before Voyager 1, is the
   longest continuously operated spacecraft. It is about 9.5 billion miles
   (15 billion kilometers) away from our sun.

   Voyager mission controllers still talk to or receive data from Voyager
   1 and Voyager 2 every day, though the emitted signals are currently
   very dim, at about 23 watts -- the power of a refrigerator light bulb.
   By the time the signals get to Earth, they are a fraction of a
   billion-billionth of a watt. Data from Voyager 1's instruments are
   transmitted to Earth typically at 160 bits per second, and captured by
   34- and 70-meter NASA Deep Space Network stations. Traveling at the
   speed of light, a signal from Voyager 1 takes about 17 hours to travel
   to Earth. After the data are transmitted to JPL and processed by the
   science teams, Voyager data are made publicly available.

   "Voyager has boldly gone where no probe has gone before, marking one of
   the most significant technological achievements in the annals of the
   history of science, and adding a new chapter in human scientific dreams
   and endeavors," said John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for
   science in Washington. "Perhaps some future deep space explorers will
   catch up with Voyager, our first interstellar envoy, and reflect on how
   this intrepid spacecraft helped enable their journey."

   Scientists do not know when Voyager 1 will reach the undisturbed part
   of interstellar space where there is no influence from our sun. They
   also are not certain when Voyager 2 is expected to cross into
   interstellar space, but they believe it is not very far behind.

   JPL built and operates the twin Voyager spacecraft. The Voyagers
   Interstellar Mission is a part of NASA's Heliophysics System
   Observatory, sponsored by the Heliophysics Division of NASA's Science
   Mission Directorate in Washington. NASA's Deep Space Network, managed
   by JPL, is an international network of antennas that supports
   interplanetary spacecraft missions and radio and radar astronomy
   observations for the exploration of the solar system and the universe.
   The network also supports selected Earth-orbiting missions.

   The cost of the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions -- including launch,
   mission operations and the spacecraft's nuclear batteries, which were
   provided by the Department of Energy -- is about $988 million through
   September.
