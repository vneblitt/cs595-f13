Donald Trump Takes a Fawning D.C. by Storm

   Posted by [86]Aaron Wiener on Sep. 10, 2013 at 12:23 pm
   It's gonna be yooooge: Trump tells Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton about his
   plans for the hotel.

   It's gonna be yooooge: Trump tells Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton about his
   plans for the hotel.

   Break out the politicos, the superlatives, and the Apprentice
   jokes: Donald Trump is in town.

   The real estate magnate, TV personality, and near-presidential
   candidate stopped by the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue this
   morning to present his plans to convert the 1899 building into a $200
   million luxury hotel. Mayor Vince Gray, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, and
   half the D.C. Council turned out to heap praise on Trump and his
   aspirations for the Trump International Hotel. Trump will be
   [87]leasing the property from the federal government for an initial
   base rent of $250,000 a month.

   "Normally when you announce a hotel, two people show up," Trump said,
   impressed with the political-media circus that packed the conference
   room.

   Trump spared no superlatives in describing his plans for the hotel.
   "The rooms will be incredible," he said. "The view are going to be
   absolutely amazing. The ballroom will be one of the great ballrooms in
   the country."
   Trump, Norton, Gray, and others admire a rendering of a guest room at
   the hotel.

   the hotel.

   So what's going to be in the hotel? According to Trump's
   daughter Ivanka, "The design juxtaposes the strength and masculinity of
   the building with gentler touches." It'll include a grand atrium, or
   cortile, that interior designer Betsy Hughes of Hirsch Bedner
   Associates calls "the most dramatic, beautiful, and chic place in
   D.C."; a "library" whose walls will be line with bookcases; spacious
   guest rooms (an average of 600 square feet) with high ceilings; two
   presidential suites in the former offices of the postmaster general,
   with bulletproof windows; and entrances from 11th Street NW to both the
   hotel and the grand ballroom.

   Trump highlighted his deep pockets as a reason that he was chosen over
   other developers to build the project, and a reason to expect big
   things from the hotel. "Cost is no object, 'cause if it were, I
   wouldn't do it," he said. "There are other ways to make a buck. It's
   like a painting."
   Trump welcomes Gray to the event.

   Gray trumpeted the economic development the hotel will bring the city:
   $100 million of tax revenue over 10 years, 700 construction jobs over
   18 months, and 300 permanent jobs. "This is a $200 million investment
   in the future of this city," Gray said, "and I can't think of a family
   better suited to it than the Trump family."

   Trump tells me that he plans to set up "a group, a committee" to ensure
   that a sizable portion of both construction and permanent jobs at the
   hotel will go to D.C. residents.
   Trump whispers something to Ward 8 Councilmember Marion Barry, before
   telling him, "Just keep it up. Tough cookie."

   telling him, "Just keep it up. Tough cookie."

   The redevelopment of the Old Post Office has been a long time coming.
   When the building was completed in 1899, it was D.C.'s first
   steel-frame building. But there were multiple attempts to demolish it:
   first during the Great Depression, and again starting in the 1960s. A
   group of activists helped persuade the federal government, which has
   overseen the property, to keep it intact.

   "You have to love a building that survived not just one, but two
   concerted efforts to demolish it," said Dorothy Robyn, commissioner of
   the General Services Administration's Public Buildings Service.

   "They have put to rest the saga of the Old Post Office building,"
   Norton said of the Trumps. "We've been trying for literally my entire
   time in Congress."
   Trump talks to members of the D.C. Council. When he's introduced to
   them, he says, "Ah, this is the power."

   them, he says, "Ah, this is the power."

   Trump says the room rates have yet to be set. When I ask if they're
   likely to be the priciest in town, he replies, "I dunno, depends what
   happens with the economy."

   But Trump is not lacking in confidence. "What I do best is build," he
   told the crowd. "Better than The Apprentice, better than politics."

   Ivanka Trump has taken the lead in coordinating the process--Norton
   said, "I've worked almost exclusively with Ivanka since the Trump
   Organization won this competition." And Donald Trump is keeping the
   pressure on his daughter.

   "You better do a good job," he told her on stage, "or you're fired."

       What's embarrassing, but not shocking, is watching your "so called"
       leaders "jocking" Donald Trump. He didn't even know the members of
       the council. This man called President Obama every name in the
       book. You all should have seen it. It was nauseating watching these
       fools trying to get photo ops with this "twice" bankrupt clown.
       Even with his white privilege and a $600 million advance from his
       father, he still failed twice!! Please people, don't be
       impressed...

       You are absolutely correct. I think it is time for these "leaders"
       to retire. But don't worry this venture will probably fail and then
       guess who will be stuck with the bill?

       Wonder if Trump's agitprop puppetmaster, Roger Stone, was in
       attendance? Nothing about the hyperbole suggests anything different
       then the usual ballyhoo around these projects. Ms. Hughes might
       want to get out more in DC before popping off. I'll wait 'til she
       tops the old LOC before I vote on the chic thing. Holmes Norton
       continues to embarass herself and us. Ivanka seems like a decent
       sort and a vast improvement over that dreadful Weymouth disaster.
       At least Ivanka knows enough to use a decent colorist and more
       frequently than one a year.

       What could be better than having the grand ceremonial avenue of the
       nation's capitol city emblazoned with the grand ceremonial name of
       the nation's most crassly cringe-worthy self-promoting blowhard?
       I can only imagine that someone in GSA feared that if Trump's
       proposal was turned down, the Trump folk would attribute the
       rejection to The Donald's long, loud, and ranting questioning of
       Barack Obama's birthplace.
       Ugh.

       Thanks for the pic of David Grosso who looks like he has a hard-on
       for the Trumpster. Made my day!

       LOL..... The pictures of the council members and the mayor
       "gushing" over Trump is hilarious!!
       Grosso looks like he wants a "kiss".... lmao.
       Even the "old bag" from the Hill showed up. She never leaves the
       Hill for anything. She has probably the smallest congressional
       district in the country and never visits her constituents. Why do
       people keep re-relecting her? Insanity.
       DC's elected leadership getting "goose bumps" over this guy is
       embarrassing.... the Trump name made trade well in NY but in DC....
       we'll see. How did Trump Vodka sell in DC??
       But the city needs more hotel rooms...... Small time DC pols....lol

       only time will tell.
       meanwhile, trees will fall, paper will roll through the presses.
       extra extra.
       uh, wait, that was the old days.
       energy will burn, electricity will hum, bytes will fly, media
       media.
       only time will tell.
