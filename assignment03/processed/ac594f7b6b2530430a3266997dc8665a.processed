   Zach Johnson, who shot a final-round 65 to win the BMW Championship at
   Conway Farms: "This is the Midwest, man. This is Chicago."
   By [129]Teddy Greenstein, Chicago Tribune reporter

   8:16 p.m. CDT, September 16, 2013

   Shortly after Zach Johnson tapped in on No. 18 at Conway Farms, he bent
   over, taking a deep breath.

   It was a moment of reflection after he fired a final-round, 6-under-par
   65 to win the BMW Championship by two shots.

   "I just had to gather myself," he said. "I feel blessed. The peace I
   had out there ..."

   The Iowa native felt the love all day from the 10,000-plus fans who
   endured muddy conditions to witness the Monday finish in Lake Forest.

   "I'm not from Chicago," Johnson said, "but I feel local. And the fans
   that followed me today, I heard it. I heard 'Go Iowa, go Drake, go
   Regis,' my high school. I don't want to understate that or take it for
   granted."

   Johnson finished at 16 under, beating Nick Watney by a pair.
   Third-round leader Jim Furyk fell to third with a final-round 71 but
   showed great sportsmanship after coming off the 18th green.

   While Johnson was on the interview podium, Furyk got his attention and
   mouthed, "Nice playing."

   Johnson's playing partner, Brandt Snedeker, showed his admiration on
   the 17th green. After Johnson sank a downhill, double-breaking, 13-foot
   birdie putt, Snedeker gave him a fist bump as if they were teammates in
   a Ryder Cup match.

   "I was pulling hard for him," Snedeker said. "You see a guy play that
   well, you want him to (win)."

   Said Johnson: "Sneds was still trying to compete and fight. But that
   was a nice gesture. That's what friends do."

   After taking a two-shot lead on 17, Johnson walked to the 18th tee box
   to calls of "Stay hot" and "Go Hawkeyes."

   He struck his drive so cleanly, producing a draw onto the 18th fairway,
   he didn't even bother to watch it land. Same for his 4-iron layup shot.
   He handed the club to caddie Damon Green before it landed.

   "He's not afraid to win," Green said. "A lot of guys might back up in
   that (tight) situation. He wants to keep going, pedal to the metal.
   When you're down, he wants to stomp on you."

   Johnson's birdie putt from 18 feet settled inches from the cup, and
   Johnson approached it as if eager to close out his 10th PGA Tour
   victory. But Green and Snedeker helped persuade him to mark it and
   wait.

   "To be able to tap out, knowing you have won the golf tournament,"
   Snedeker said, "that's a special moment I wanted him to have."

   Johnson, who was angered Saturday after a spectator near the 18th green
   hollered, "Zach, you suck!" saluted the crowd Monday by applauding as
   he made a 360-degree turn.

   "This is the Midwest, man. This is Chicago," he said. "I've got
   brothers here, cousins, uncles. This is the big city east of where I'm
   from."

   He paused and said, "It just dawned on me that I won."

   Johnson first played at Conway Farms in 1997 at the NCAA Championship.
   The course dazzled him, but it was not even a PGA Tour stop, let alone
   a major venue. He remembered thinking: "This place is amazing. What's
   Augusta like?"

   He shot an 81 but followed with a 69.

   "I kind of got used to it," he said.

   He came back a few weeks ago to play a practice round with family
   members. Turns out he planned it all just right.

   "A great week," he said, summing it up. "And a phenomenal day."
