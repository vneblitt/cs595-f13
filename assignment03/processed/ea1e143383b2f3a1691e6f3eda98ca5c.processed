   Press Conference at NJIT in Newark - September 3, 2013. (Transcript
   Below)
   Governor Christie: This type of project allows us to increase the
   number of seats that are available for New Jersey students to stay and
   go to college or university here in our state without having to
   compromise for a moment the quality of the education that they would
   receive any place else. You know you have lots of people who talk the
   talk about investing in higher education, and everybody understands
   that a better higher education institution creates the opportunity for
   more good paying jobs not only for the folks who build and renovate
   these building, but for the folks in the private sector who will come
   in and then wind up with new opportunities for growth in all these
   different industries in our state. It's easy to talk about it, the more
   difficult part is making the decision to commit the resources that are
   necessary to be able to make it happen. That's why I want to compliment
   the Senate President Steve Sweeney, the Speaker Sheila Oliver, for
   doing this is a bipartisan way. And I want to compliment the men and
   women of New Jersey who went to the polls -- and even during at times
   of challenging economic times -- said investing $1.3 billion in New
   Jersey's students will make New Jersey a better and stronger place.
