   MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2012, [14]7:00 - 8:30PM
   In Who I Am, Pete Townshend‚guitarist, songwriter, singer and founding
   member of The Who‚at last tells his story.
   In conversation with Paul Holdengr√§ber, one of rock-and-roll's biggest
   icons will talk about his most intimate memories; from the inner
   sanctum of Eric Clapton's drug-ridden hotel rooms to the feet of Jimi
   Hendrix and his electric kool-aid guitar; from the first trial
   performance of Townshend's rock opera, Tommy, in a London bar to
   setting the record with The Who as the world's loudest band, Townshend
   will unload the journey that left him writing songs for "the best live
   band of all time." Hear the stories straight from the mouth that sang
   on the front lines of rock-and-roll's takeover of the music world.
   PETE TOWNSHEND is the legendary lead guitarist and principal songwriter
   for The Who, one of the most influential rock-and-roll bands of all
   time. Townshend is responsible for having written over 100 songs and
   rock operas in the band's important catalogue. He is one of Rolling
   Stone's "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" and was inducted into the
   Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. He resides in West London, where he
   was raised.
