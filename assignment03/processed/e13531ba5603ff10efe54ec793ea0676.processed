[25]The Stubborn States Refusing To Expand Medicaid Are Going To End Up
Exacerbating Rural Poverty

   The political fight over Obamacare's optional Medicaid expansion has
   emerged as a partisan issue -- while Democratic-controlled states have
   agreed to expand the public health program, GOP-led states remain
   resistant to anything that might seem like cooperating with the health
   reform law. But it's not just a divide between blue and red. Medicaid
   expansion also has the potential to [27]widen the gulf between urban
   and rural America.

   At a [28]recent conference on rural health care, health economists
   warned that the battle to implement health reform has huge implications
   for rural areas of the country, which already tend to [29]lack access
   to a [30]wide range of medical services. When researchers look
   specifically at the rural residents who could gain coverage under the
   Medicaid expansion, more than half of them live in states that have
   refused to expand the program. The opposite is true for the people who
   live in urban areas -- more than half of the urban residents who could
   become eligible for Medicaid coverage under Obamacare are living in
   states that have accepted the expansion.

   That's why Tim McBride, a health economist with the Rural Policy
   Research Institute's Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis, sees
   Medicaid expansion as a "rural issue."

   "I don't see an upside to not expanding," McBride [31]told hospital
   administrators and health care professionals at the recent conference.
   "The truth is, this will be really important money for rural hospitals,
   rural health providers, rural communities."

   Obamacare partially funds the Medicaid expansion by making some cuts to
   hospitals' reimbursement rates. Those cuts were intended to be eased by
   the hundreds of thousands of previously uninsured people gaining access
   to Medicaid, as well as the federal funds designated for states that
   choose to expand the program. But in states that have rejected the
   expansion, rural hospitals face cuts without getting any of the
   potential benefits to offset them. States like Missouri have projected
   that, without Medicaid expansion, up to 50 percent of the rural
   hospitals in the state are [32]likely to be forced to close.

   In additional to rural health care providers, rural residents also
   stand to significantly benefit from Obamacare's expansion. Since the
   rural poor are less likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance,
   they're therefore more likely to either rely on public programs like
   Medicaid or go uninsured. This is the population that the health reform
   law intends to reach through either the expanded state-level Medicaid
   pools or the new state-level insurance marketplaces that will open next
   month.

   Previous studies have found that health disparities between rich and
   poor areas of the country are [33]only getting worse. Health outcomes
   are increasingly tied to the zip codes where people live. And because
   the Republican lawmakers who continue to resist health reform govern
   some of the [34]sickest and most uninsured areas of the country, they
   have the power to [35]widen the gulf between the healthiest and sickest
   states even further. Nearly two out of three low-income Americans who
   are eligible for Medicaid coverage under Obamacare likely [36]won't get
   those benefits next year because their legislators are blocking them.
