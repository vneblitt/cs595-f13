Getting In Tune: Women's Summer Music Festivals

   Summer can evoke images of friends, music, freedom, and the outdoors.
   Although people don't generally associate libraries with music and the
   outdoors, some collections of personal papers currently held by the
   Schlesinger Library contain materials from open-air events, such as
   women's music festivals.  Many of these music festivals began in the
   1970s, and women who attended them often experienced them as a form of
   fellowship. The events provided a supportive community for those who
   may have felt isolated in the larger society.

   The concert programs, performance contracts, well-worn t-shirts, and
   other souvenirs represent the many facets and contexts of these types
   of festivals. One can access material about the same event from
   multiple people who were involved. One of these women, feminist,
   activist and musician [58]Holly Near, wrote and performed music that
   came to represent the spirit of women's music festivals. In 1976 Holly
   Near participated in a seven-city tour of California. Called "Women On
   Wheels," it became known as the first major tour of feminist and
   lesbian artists. Near toured and performed widely at many women's music
   festivals and concerts in the United States and abroad through the late
   1990s. Often cited as one of the founders of the "women's music"
   movement, she also worked for peace and multicultural consciousness.

   A pioneer in women's studies and feminist philosophy, Joyce Trebilcot
   attended many music festivals at which Near performed. Trebilcot was
   the first woman tenured in the department of philosophy and the
   cofounder of the women's studies program at Washington University in
   St. Louis, Missouri. The author of Dyke Ideas: Process, Politics, Daily
   Life (1994), she collected and saved memorabilia such as t-shirts,
   posters, buttons, and other items that capture the women's music
   festival experience.

   and 1997

   These diverse items of remembrance can open the porthole just a little
   wider to a past experience, giving the researcher a more complete
   vision of an intense, momentary event.
