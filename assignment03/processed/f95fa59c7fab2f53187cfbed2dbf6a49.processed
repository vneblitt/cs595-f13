   BLACKSBURG, Va., April 8, 2013 - Nicholas Onopa of Wausau, Wis., a
   senior majoring in public and urban affairs in the [160]College of
   Architecture and Urban Studies, with minors in international studies
   and business leadership, has been selected the 2013 Virginia Tech
   Undergraduate Man of the Year. Darya "Dasha" Nesterova of Fairfax, Va.,
   a senior majoring in biological sciences in the [161]College of
   Science, with minors in psychology and medicine and society, has been
   named the Virginia Tech 2013 Undergraduate Woman of the Year.

   The Undergraduate Man and Woman of the Year awards recognize two
   graduating students who have achieved overall excellence during their
   undergraduate careers at the university. They are the most prestigious
   non-academic undergraduate awards given at Virginia Tech and are
   awarded to those students who have exceptional and balanced achievement
   in academics, leadership, and service.

   Recipients exemplify the qualities and values important to a Virginia
   Tech education, captured in the university motto, Ut Prosim (That I May
   Serve), and are selected by a committee of students, faculty, and
   administrators from across the academic colleges and the [162]Division
   of Student Affairs. The division sponsors and administers the annual
   awards, now in their 61st year.

Nicholas Onopa, Undergraduate Man of the Year

   Onopa started early in his role as a leader when he was part of the
   Student Government Association's Freshman Leadership Experience in fall
   2009. He participated in Emerging Interfraternal Leaders in fall 2010
   and Passport to Leadership, a study broad program through the
   University of Virginia, in summer 2011.

   Onopa has served as the undergraduate representative on the Virginia
   Tech Board of Visitors, president of Kappa Delta Chapter of Delta Sigma
   Phi fraternity, a teaching assistant for a freshman honors seminar, and
   a member of the Student Life Council. He received the Fraternity and
   Sorority Life Courageous Leadership Award.

   Academically, Onopa is a dean's list student and has been recognized by
   University Honors for maintaining a grade point average above 3.5 (on a
   4.0 scale) while completing extra hours of coursework.

   "I have found Nick to be one of those very special leaders who I know
   will leave this place and go on to achieve great things for others and
   himself," said Edward F.D. Spencer, vice president emeritus of student
   affairs.

   Onopa is the son of Richard and Mary Jo Onopa.

Darya Nesterova, Undergraduate Woman of the Year

   Nesterova is a member of the University Honors Program who will
   graduate in December 2013.

   In 2010 she went on a medical service trip to Peru, where she
   volunteered to help set up free clinics in San Lorenzo, Ville Sharon,
   and Pachacutec in the city of Lima. In 2011 she was awarded the Gough
   Scholarship to study the impact of culture on medical practice in
   Russia and Uzbekistan. In addition, she is an undergraduate research
   scholar with the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute and has worked with
   engineers, biologists, and writers on research projects that address
   global issues.

   Nesterova has a near perfect grade point average and is president of
   the American Medical Student Association. She has served as a volunteer
   at the New River Valley Hospice and participated in the university's
   Hospital Preceptorship Program and was part of the Virginia United
   Regional iGEM Synthetic Biology Team.

   "What I find truly exceptional about Darya is her passion for learning
   and discovery," said Jack Evans, a faculty member in the Department of
   Biological Sciences. "She has a true love for learning and a genuine
   desire to contribute to the field of science and thus humanity."

   Nesterova is the daughter of Sergey and Elena Nesterova.

   Dedicated to its motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), [163]Virginia
   Tech takes a hands-on, engaging approach to education, preparing
   scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the
   commonwealth's most comprehensive university and its leading research
   institution, Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree
   programs to more than 30,000 students and manages a research portfolio
   of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of
   transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and
   by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and
   across Virginia.
