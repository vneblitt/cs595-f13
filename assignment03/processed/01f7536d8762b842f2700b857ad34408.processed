Flashback: The March On Washington

   August 28, 2013 9:55 AM

   Fifty years ago today, an estimated 250,000 people traveled to
   Washington, D.C., for the [22]March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom
   â one of the largest civil rights rallies in American history, and the
   day that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his indelible "I Have A
   Dream" speech.

   The [23]Race Card Project interviewed several people who were there
   that day, including [24]Robert Avery, [25]Dr. Clarence B. Jones,
   [26]Jack Hansan, [27]Martin H. Niverth, and [28]Edith Lee-Payne.

   To give a sense of the day, we've put together this audio-visual
   experiment using their firsthand stories as well as archival materials.
   Launch the presentation, then use the arrows to move through at your
   own pace.
