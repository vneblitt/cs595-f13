Slash -- I LOVE Axl... (The Baby).

   [29]Celebrity Feuds
   9/16/2013 12:15 AM PDT [30]BY TMZ STAFF
   Slash
   I LOVE Axl...
   (The Baby)
   [31]091313_slash_launch
   Rock-n-roll legend Slash has no love for ex-Guns N' Roses bandmate Axl
   Rose -- they have a 20-year feud and no one really remembers why -- but
   he still thinks Axl is a great name for a kid.
   Slash -- sans trademark tophat and wearing a backward ballcap -- hit up
   The Sayers Club in Hollywood last week ... and had nothing but love for
   Fergie and Josh Duhamel's baby -- who they are rumored to have named
   after Axl Rose.
   "I think it's really cool, I actually talked to [Fergie and Josh]
   yesterday, " Slash told us. "It's all good ... who am I to judge?"

   I think Josh should have a paternity test done on the Baby, It looks
   more like Slashes kid than Josh's.

   He probably doesn't want to offend Fergie, who doesn't really offend
   anyone. I bet he laughs about it at home. The kid's name is Axl Jack.
   It sounds like a name for an aspiring car mechanic. It might be a
   Hispanic name really. Maybe it is similar to the name Ajax from Greek
   mythology. She could name her next kid Ajax Soap. That would take care
   of the auto shop and the laundry after.
