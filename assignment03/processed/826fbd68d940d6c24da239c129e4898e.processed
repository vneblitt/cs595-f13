   The [7]international collections of the Library of Congress started
   with the arrival of the Thomas Jefferson library in 1815. Today the
   Library's international collections are unparalleled; they are
   comprehensive in scope and include research materials in more than 460
   languages and in many media.

   Like its sister exhibition, [8]American Treasures, this installation
   will be an ongoing exhibition and will feature the most treasured
   materials. The Library of Congress international gallery starts with
   "Beginnings," an exploration of how world cultures have dealt with the
   creation of the universe and explained the heavens and the earth.
   "Beginnings" will run through March 15, 2003. World Treasures will
   reopen with a new theme Fall, 2005.
