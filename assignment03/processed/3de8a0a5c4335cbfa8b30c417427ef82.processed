Social Media Registry

What It Is

   The Social Media Registry is a tool to keep track of social media
   accounts managed by federal agencies. It helps the public identify
   official agency social media accounts and helps federal agencies manage
   their social media efforts. The public-facing side is hosted on
   [80]USA.gov and [81]GobiernoUSA.gov, and the agency-facing side is
   hosted here on HowTo.gov.

   The Social Media Registry also offers [82]a series of APIs to allow
   developers to build applications with the data stored on the registry.
   Full documentation of the APIs is hosted on USA.gov.

   Using the API, GSA has also built [83]embeddable Twitter Widgets, a
   suite of dynamic widgets that aggregate tweets from across federal
   agencies and by topic. These widgets demonstrate the power of the
   Registry and the API--so anyone can access content from across
   thousands of federal social media accounts, updated in real-time.

Why It's Important

   Agencies can use this tool to register their social media accounts and
   verify which social media accounts are "official" (similar to how
   Twitter "verifies" high-profile accounts). This will help the public to
   know and trust information shared via these official accounts.

Specific Requirements

   The Social Media Registry only includes accounts that represent
   official U.S. government agencies, organizations, or programs. You can
   register accounts managed by federal agencies, elected officials (not
   campaign accounts), heads of agencies or members of the President's
   Cabinet. Do not enter personal, employee, or other types of accounts.
   If you have any questions or comments, contact
   [84]socialmediaregistry@gsa.gov.

How to Implement

   [85]Register a new account or edit an existing account.
