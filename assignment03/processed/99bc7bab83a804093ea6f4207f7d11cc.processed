2013 SEASON

   Michael Alpert and Ethel Raim An-sky Yiddish Heritage Ensemble
   Klezmer and other Yiddish music from New York
   Tuesday, JUNE 25 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   The An-sky Yiddish Heritage Ensemble -- renowned Yiddish folk singers
   Michael Alpert and Ethel Raim, tsimblist (hammered dulcimer player)
   Pete Rushefsky and violinist Jake Shulman-Ment -- celebrates the
   hundredth Anniversary of the historic An-sky Expedition. This 1911-1914
   ethographic expedition systematically documented the Jewish folk
   culture of dozens of communities in Ukraine and White Russia.  It is
   named for its leader, Yiddish writer and folklorist Semyon An-sky, pen
   name of Shloyme Zaynvl Rapoport (1863-1920), who is best known as the
   author of the groundbreaking play The Dybbuk.  The An-sky materials,
   located at the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg, stand
   as an unparalleled record of a lost, preindustrial Jewish society that
   was carried out in the Yiddish language. Inspired by An-sky's work, and
   affiliated with the New York-based Center for Traditional Music and
   Dance ([13]www.ctmd.org External link ), the An-sky Yiddish Heritage
   Ensemble is a supergroup of four leading performers and researchers of
   Yiddish music who present a diverse program of rare Yiddish folksongs
   and exciting klezmer instrumentals collected through field and archival
   research. The ensemble also performs original music rooted in the
   tradition, and in doing so keeps the flame of Yiddish culture alive.

   The An-sky Yiddish Heritage Ensemble and the Center for Traditional
   Music and Dance are supported by the Keller-Shatanoff Foundation and
   the Atran Foundation.
   Libaya Baba Libaya Baba
   Garifuna Music and Dance from California and New York
   Tuesday, JULY 2 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   Libaya Baba means "Grandfather's Grandchildren." The group consists of
   three brothers Jeffrey, Kelsie, and Dayton Bernardez, and their cousin,
   Greg Palacio.  Their first influence came from their grandfather, Cyril
   Antonio, and other master drummers of Dangriga, Belize. After migrating
   to Los Angeles, California, in the late 1970s, they felt the need to
   preserve their indigenous Garifuna culture, which has both Caribbean
   and West African elements. Libaya Baba has retained the traditional
   format of call and response in songs, to uphold the memory of their
   ancestors. Their music is accompanied by a pair of Sisira (maracas),
   one Primero (small wooden snare drum), two Segundas (mid size & large
   wooden bass drums) Conch and Turtle shells. The genres of music they
   play include Hüngü-hüngü, Paranda, Punta, Kulióu, Wanaragua, Hupi
   Malad, Warini, Gunjéi, "Two for Shilling," Chumba and Chárikanári. They
   have intrigued audiences throughout the U.S.
   Harmonia Harmonia
   Music of the Danube to the Carpathians from Ohio
   Thursday, JULY 11 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   Harmonia presents traditional folk music of Eastern Europe, ranging
   from the Danube to the Carpathians. Its repertoire reflects the
   cultures of this region: Hungarian, Slovak, Ukrainian, Romanian,
   Croatian and Gypsy. Performed on authentic folk instruments, and styled
   after turn-of-the-century eastern-European Gypsy bands, their music is
   drawn from both the urban and rural traditions of eastern Europe. The
   musicians come from varied eastern-European backgrounds; in Harmonia
   they have found a common musical language. In addition to being
   polished performers on instruments as varied as accordion, upright
   bass, violin, pan-flute, and cimbalom (hammered dulcimer), Harmonia's
   members are adept at explaining their music and culture to diverse
   audiences. Harmonia brings to the concert stage the vitality and
   excitement of ethnic weddings, celebrations, and smoky cafés that
   inspired composers such as Bartok, Brahms and Liszt.
   The Brotherhood Singers The Brotherhood Singers
   R&B and Gospel from Kentucky
   Wednesday, AUGUST 7 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   Hailing from Covington, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio, the Brotherhood
   Singers (formerly The Northern Kentucky Brotherhood Singers) are among
   the very few remaining gospel quartet-style groups that still perform
   in the old-school a cappella fashion. The Singers specialize in the
   intricate and emotional four-part harmony "jubilee" style pioneered by
   such legendary groups as the Dixie Hummingbirds, The Golden Gate
   Quartet, the Soul Stirrers and The Harptones of Cincinnati. The
   Brotherhood Singers started singing at the 9th Street Baptist Church in
   Covington. The group has performed in churches, secular music venues
   and television spots throughout the U.S., as well as in Canada and
   Spain, which they have toured 17 times. In April 2012, they toured
   Russia as part of the first "Festival of Traditional American Music," a
   joint project of AFC, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, and CEC ArtsLink.
   They sing primarily Gospel but have recently added patriotic songs and
   feel-good R&B to their repertoire.
   Kalanidhi Dance Kalanidhi Dance
   Traditional Kuchipudi Dance from Maryland
   Wednesday, AUGUST 14 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   Kalanidhi Dance Company was founded in 2005. Its artistic approach is
   to explore creative and contemporary ideas through the vocabulary of
   Kuchipudi, while retaining the essence and integrity of the classical
   form. Kuchipudi, one of India's seven main classical dance styles,
   combines fast rhythms with fluid movements, creating a blend of control
   and abandon, strength and delicacy. Expressive facial techniques and
   subtle body movements serve as the cornerstone of Kuchipudi and
   document and preserve the centuries-old body language of Andhra Pradesh
   women. Trained in the rigors of the Vempati style, the Kalanidhi Dance
   Company very quickly gained a reputation for producing new and original
   choreography that has been praised by Indian and American dance
   critics. An important part of the company's mission is to promote
   dialogue in the arts and to nourish creativity through interaction with
   artists of other styles and genres.  Kalanidhi Dance toured India in
   October 2007 to participate alongside some of India's best dance
   troupes in the Ananya festival, one of India's most prestigious dance
   festivals.  Kalanidhi Dance was also presented at India's premier
   classical dance institution, Kalakshetra in Chennai.
   Los Texmaniacs Los Texmaniacs
   Traditional Conjunto Dance music from Texas
   Wednesday, SEPTEMBER 11 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   Los Texmaniacs mix the simplest yet finest ingredients of Texas music
   to create a sound solidly rooted in tradition, exploding with
   contemporary vitality. Their versatility has led them to perform at The
   Smithsonian Folklife Festival, The International Accordion Festival,
   The Kennedy Center, The Governor of Texas Ball, and many major
   festivals overseas in countries such as Germany, Holland, and Spain.
   Founder Max Baca is a renowned innovator on the bajo sexto, a twelve
   string guitar-like instrument, which customarily provides rhythm
   accompaniment for the button accordion, creating the core of the Texas
   conjunto sound. Los Texmaniacs is a product of Baca's wide-ranging
   experience touring and recording with his father's family conjunto,
   Flaco Jimenenz, the original Texas Tornados, Los Super Seven, and even
   the Rolling Stones. His travels have included tours to Iraq, Bosnia,
   Afghanistan, and Kosovo to entertain American troops. He has appeared
   on national television programs such as Conan O' Brien, David
   Letterman, Jay Leno, and Austin City Limits, and has been featured in
   several documentaries, including Songs of the Homeland, American Roots
   Music, and Latin Music USA. Max has participated on ten Grammy-winning
   projects, including the double-platinum CD for the Rolling Stones
   Voodoo Lounge. In 2009 Los TexManiacs won a Grammy Award for their
   album Borders Y Bailes, released on Smithsonian Folkways.

   career as singer, composer, and teacher of Sephardic song, and will
   honor her role as "keeper of the flame" for preserving, perpetuating,
   and expanding this venerable Jewish cultural tradition. Family members
   and musical colleagues and from the Washington, D.C., area and beyond

   Artist in the Folklife Apprenticeship Program for the Virginia
   Foundation for the Humanities. Born in Sarajevo, Bosnia, in 1923, Flory
   Jagoda learned many songs from her Nona (grandmother) and other family
   members, who were known as the "Singing Altaracs." Her original

   singers and groups in the U.S. and Europe and many are now firmly
   entrenched in Sephardic song tradition. This concert is co-sponsored by
   the Library of Congress Music Division.

2012 SEASON

   Dennis Stroughmatt et L'Esprit Creole Dennis Stroughmatt et L'Esprit
   Creole
   Upper Louisiana French Creole Music from Missouri
   Thursday, JUNE 21 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   Dennis Stroughmatt, born and raised in southeastern Illinois, is an
   authority on French Creole music and culture of "Upper Louisiana," aka
   Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana, which came to the United States as
   part of the Louisiana Purchase. By an amazing string of chance events,
   young Dennis Stroughmatt came upon the descendants of French Midwestern
   settlers, and he spent over three years in southeast Missouri learning
   to speak Illinois French Creole, play the fiddle, and sing many of the
   traditional songs that have thrived in the region for over three
   hundred years. He would also go on to live, work and play music in the
   "Cajun country" of Louisiana, and to study in Quebec, thus completing
   the circle of French culture in North America. With the blessing of the
   Creole people of the Midwest, Dennis Stroughmatt et l'Espirit Creole
   are its passionate ambassadors, expanding interest and excitement in a
   region that has been, in many ways, ignored by the history books. As a
   result, the French music, language, stories, and culture once hidden
   away in the Missouri Ozarks now has a voice in the wider world.  As
   they say in the hills: "On est toujours icitte: We are still here!"

   Unukupukupu Unukupukupu
   Halau Hula (Hula School) of Hawai`i Community College, Hilo, Hawai`i

   Unukupukupu is the traditional Halau Hula (Hula School) of [16]Hawai`i
   Community College, Hilo, Hawai`i External link .  Here ancient dances
   and songs, rooted in the sacred `Aiha`a Pele (Ritual Dance of Volcanic
   Phenomena) intermingle with the rigor of academic inquiry. To
   experience the particular fiery style of hula termed `Aiha`a Pele, one
   is trained to call up the fire within the body and to dance until sweat
   shines at the temples and forehead. Under the cultural and academic
   stewardship of Dr. Taupouri Tangaroto, Unukupukupu is a community of
   traditional dancers functionally aware that Hula is one of the world's
   sacred dances of environmental kinship and global connections.
   Ruze Dalmatinke Ruze Dalmatinke
   Traditional Croatian Singing from Washington State
   Wednesday, JULY 18 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   Ruze Dalmatinke, from Seattle, Washington. Deep passion and intense
   devotion to Croatian musical heritage have kept the group active since
   1981, and have inspired the group's lead vocalists, sisters Binki and
   Alma, since childhood. Binki Franulovic Spahi (lead voice) and Alma
   Franulovic Plancich (second voice) lead Ruze Dalmatinke in singing, and
   are responsible for the group's adherence to traditional purity in
   their music. From the town of Vela Luka on the island of Korcula,
   Dalmatia, Croatia, they immigrated with their family to the United
   States after World War II. Having sung together since childhood, the
   sisters brought with them their lifestyle of singing, as well as an
   oral tradition generations old. Their voices are accompanied by
   instrumentation, adding to the vocal harmonies. The band members, also
   vocalists, along with Binki and Alma, perform music from the many
   different regions of Croatia - from the tranquil Dalmatian ballads to
   the strident melodies of the interior.
   Jean Theroux and Patrick Ross Les Bon Hommes Du Nord: Patrick Ross and
   Jean Theroux, with Dalton Binette and Bow Thayer
   French-Canadian Fiddle Music & Songs from New Hampshire
   Wednesday, AUGUST 8 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   Patrick Ross and Jean Theroux will present a program of fiddle tunes
   and songs drawn from their French-Canadian heritage. Ross, a frequent
   winner at fiddle contests throughout Northern New England, is a
   fifth-generation fiddler. Theroux is a well respected community-based
   fiddler and vocalist. They will be joined by Dalton Binette and Bow
   Thayer.  All four musicians hail from the northernmost area of New
   Hampshire, adjacent to the Canadian border, across which people and
   cultural influences have flowed steadily over the last hundred years or
   more. The fiddle, accordion, and guitar are the most common instruments
   used in French-Canadian music. The playing style is spirited and based
   upon rhythmic patterns of the Celtic world: jigs, reels, and waltzes.
   However, the music is not exactly Celtic: the bowing style has a
   different swing and the tunes are ornamented in a distinctive way.
   Singing in the French language with family and friends is also an
   important part of French-Canadian musical heritage, and many of the
   songs are classified as "chansons à répondre," or "call and response,"
   a style developed so a large group can join in the fun without knowing
   all the words.
   Robert Shafer, Bobby Taylor and Robin Kessinger Robert Shafer, Robin
   Kessinger and Bobby Taylor
   Flatpick Guitar and Fiddle Music from Kanawha County, West Virginia
   Thursday, AUGUST 16 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   Bobby Taylor, Robert Shafer, and Robin Kessinger, three of the Kanawha
   Valley's best traditional musicians, have played together over many
   years at various musical events in the Valley and throughout West
   Virginia. They were heavily influenced by the musical talents of Clark
   Kessinger, a world renowned fiddler. Clark Kessinger recorded many
   tunes on the Brunswick label from 1928 to 1930, and later, five albums
   in the 1960s. He has influenced a world of fiddlers and musicians for
   many decades.  Clark Kessinger lived near where Robert, Robin and Bobby
   grew up in the Kanawha Valley, and Robin is his great nephew. This trio
   uses Clark's beautiful arrangements as a foundation for the music they
   play. Just like Clark Kessinger, who used every technique possible,
   they continue to explore new and exciting ways to play the great old
   tunes.
   The Singing and Praying Band The Singing and Praying Band
   African American A Capella Sacred Music from Delaware and Maryland
   Thursday, AUGUST 23 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   The Singing and Praying Bands of Delaware and Maryland (Eastern and
   Western Shore) belong to an African American devotional/musical
   tradition that is unique to the Delmarva region, probably the oldest
   living African American musical tradition in Delaware and Maryland.  In
   the past, almost half of the Methodist churches around the Delaware and
   Chesapeake Bays had their own band.  With origins in West African
   religion, Christianity, and African American ring shout traditions,
   Singing & Praying Bands developed during slavery.  The ministry of the
   Singing & Praying Bands takes place in host churches, often at a camp
   meeting after an evening preaching service is over. Members line out a
   hymn, pray a prayer, and end with a spiritual in which the group forms
   a circle, marching counterclockwise out onto the church grounds. Since
   the 1950s, the bands have diminished in number, and the singers have
   consolidated into one large band comprised of fifty to a hundred active
   members from twenty to thirty different churches. They come together
   most Sundays in the spring, summer, and fall, at a different church
   each week, and hold service there, keeping this tradition alive.
   Los Tres Reyes Los Tres Reyes
   Mexican Trío Romántico from Texas
   Thursday, SEPTEMBER 13 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   The Mexican trío romántico consists of three suave male voices backed
   by two, and sometimes three, guitars, singing romance-drenched lyrics
   in lush harmony.  The style rocketed to pan-Latin popularity in 1948
   with the pioneering group Trío Los Panchos. Los Tres Reyes (The Three
   Kings), known as "the last of the great trios," epitomize the trio
   sound and continue to make it a mainstay of Mexican acoustic music.
   High-voice Cuban singer Bebo Cárdenas joins founding members, brothers
   Gilberto and Raúl Puente, to show us how, in Cárdenas's words, "The
   trío romántico is synonymous with intimacy." The trio has a new album
   on the Smithsonian Folkways label called Romancing the Past (SFW40562).
   Mariano Gonzalez Mariano Gonzalez y sus Invitados Especiales (Mariano
   Gonzalez and his Special Guests)
   Paraguayan Folk Harp Ensemble from Nevada
   Wednesday, SEPTEMBER 26 at 12:00 noon (no tickets required)

   The Paraguayan folk harp is one of the most recognizable folk music
   traditions in South America. Las Vegas resident Mariano Gonzales
   mesmerizes audiences with his delightful and sometimes surprising
   repertoire on this handcrafted traditional instrument.  Mariano's
   career as a professional harpist, composer, and harp maker has taken
   him around the world and into multiple musical genres, but he remains
   enamored of the unique and exquisite Guarania folk music of his
   homeland. Born and raised in Buena Vista, Paraguay, he began playing
   the harp at the age of five, under the tutelage of his father and
   grandfather. His passion for music propelled him onto the world stage
   where he expanded his repertoire to include lively Latin rhythms,
   free-spirited jazz, and original arrangements of popular standards.
   Since moving to Las Vegas to tour with Tony Orlando and Dawn, he has
   generously shared his beloved harp with local audiences in community
   venues. His solo performances have included concerts at prestigious
   venues including Carnegie Hall in New York and Suntory Hall in Tokyo.
