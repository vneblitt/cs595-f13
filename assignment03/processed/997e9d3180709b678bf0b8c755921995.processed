   Pope Francis has said gay people should not be marginalised but
   integrated into society.

   Speaking to reporters on a flight back from Brazil, he reaffirmed the
   Roman Catholic Church's position that homosexual acts were sinful, but
   homosexual orientation was not.

   He was responding to questions about whether there was a "gay lobby" in
   the Vatican.

   "If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to
   judge?"

   He also said he wanted a greater role for women in the Church, but
   insisted they could not be priests.

   The Pope arrived back in Rome on Monday after a week-long tour of
   Brazil - his first trip abroad as pontiff - which climaxed with a huge
   gathering on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach for a world Catholic
   youth festival.

   Festival organisers estimated it attracted more than three million
   people.

Analysis

     __________________________________________________________________

   Pope Francis, the first ever pontiff from Latin America, has struck an
   unusual new tone.

   Now he is back at his desk in his modest Vatican quarters, he has some
   important decisions to make about the future governance of his Church.

   Normally the cardinals who run the Holy See are off on their long
   summer holidays at this time of year. But Pope Francis' seasons are not
   the same as those of his predecessors. In the Southern Hemisphere,
   where the bulk of his international flock now lives, it is winter.

   Pope Francis plans to spend the month of August preparing for some
   radical changes in the future governance of his worldwide Church. Be
   prepared for some big surprises.
     * [46]Pope Francis strikes a new tone

   His remarks on gay people are being seen as much less judgemental than
   his predecessor's position on the issue.

   Pope Benedict XVI signed a document in 2005 that said men with
   deep-rooted homosexual tendencies should not be priests.

   But Pope Francis said gay clergymen should be forgiven and their sins
   forgotten.

   "The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well," Pope
   Francis said in a wide-ranging 80-minute long interview with Vatican
   journalists.

   "It says they should not be marginalised because of this but that they
   must be integrated into society."

   But he condemned what he described as lobbying by gay people.

   "The problem is not having this orientation," he said. "We must be
   brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of
   greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies.
   This is the worse problem."

   On the role of women in the Church, he said: "We cannot limit the role
   of women in the Church to altar girls or the president of a charity,
   there must be more.

   "But with regards to the ordination of women, the Church has spoken and
   says no... That door is closed."

   Answering questions about the troubled Vatican bank, he said the
   institution must become "honest and transparent" and that he would
   listen to advice on whether it could be reformed or should be shut down
   altogether.

   "I don't know what will become of the bank. Some say it is better that
   is a bank, others that it should be a charitable fund and others say
   close it," he said.
   'Undisciplined'

   Before leaving Brazil, Pope Francis gave a highly unusual one-to-one
   interview to a Brazilian TV programme.

   The interview was shown on TV Globo's high-profile Sunday night
   documentary programme Fantastico, broadcast not long after the Pope
   departed for Rome.

   The Pope was asked about the moment on his visit when his driver took a
   wrong turn and his vehicle was surrounded by crowds.

   "I don't feel afraid," he answered. "I know that no-one dies before
   their time.

   "I don't want to see these people who have such a great heart from
   behind a glass box. The two security teams [from the Vatican and
   Brazil] worked very well. But I know that I am undisciplined in that
   respect."

   Asked about the recent protests by young people on the streets of
   Brazil, the Pope said: "The young person is essentially a
   non-conformist, and this is very beautiful.

   "It is necessary to listen to young people, give them places to express
   themselves and to be careful that they aren't manipulated."

   Asked about his simple lifestyle and use of a small car, he said it
   wasn't a good example when a priest had the latest model of a car or a
   top brand.

   "At this moment I believe God is asking us for more simplicity," he
   added.

       So happy to see this. I am not Christian myself but was raised in a
       Catholic family who were also very liberal and this hellfire and
       brimstone nonsense was always so alien to me.
       The general message I got was that we're all sinners and we should
       all love each other anyway and I think that's a pretty good one.

       Pope Francis' style is chiefly pastoral. The views he expresses in
       the above article change not one jot of Church doctrine or
       teaching. He is inline with Benedict XVI and John Paul II.
       What's different is the style and the way of conveying the message
       in more inclusive language. This is a good thing but those who
       think this means a big doctrinal shift towards secular norms, will
       be disappointed.

       So this pope is marginally less homophobic then the last one. What
       does he want? A medal?
       Surely the real news here is that he has 'insisted' women can not
       be priests. Why not? Why not gay priests? If you want an inclusive
       church then you have to be inclusive in terms of your leadership or
       you just show yourself to be outdated, patronising and
       hypocritical.

       who cares what the Pope thinks? Seriously, I could not possibly
       care if the pope accepts/condones/legitimises a persons sexuality,
       its none of the Church's business.
       But is a cop out anyway, its not "official" as its not said in
       cathedra, and what? be gay, just dont do anything that may be
       interpreted as gay?
       Maybe, they should look more at their own members sins, and leave
       the rest of us alone
