80 Percent Of U.S. Adults Face Near-Poverty, Unemployment: Survey

   WASHINGTON -- Four out of 5 U.S. adults struggle with joblessness,
   near-poverty or reliance on welfare for at least parts of their lives,
   a sign of deteriorating economic security and an elusive American
   dream.

   Survey data exclusive to The Associated Press points to an increasingly
   globalized U.S. economy, the widening gap between rich and poor, and
   the loss of good-paying manufacturing jobs as reasons for the trend.

   The findings come as President Barack Obama tries to renew his
   administration's emphasis on the economy, saying in recent speeches
   that his highest priority is to "rebuild ladders of opportunity" and
   reverse income inequality.

   As nonwhites approach a numerical majority in the U.S., one question is
   how public programs to lift the disadvantaged should be best focused -
   on the affirmative action that historically has tried to eliminate the
   racial barriers seen as the major impediment to economic equality, or
   simply on improving socioeconomic status for all, regardless of race.

   Hardship is particularly growing among whites, based on several
   measures. Pessimism among that racial group about their families'
   economic futures has climbed to the highest point since at least 1987.
   In the most recent AP-GfK poll, 63 percent of whites called the economy
   "poor."

   "I think it's going to get worse," said Irene Salyers, 52, of Buchanan
   County, Va., a declining coal region in Appalachia. Married and
   divorced three times, Salyers now helps run a fruit and vegetable stand
   with her boyfriend but it doesn't generate much income. They live
   mostly off government disability checks.

   "If you do try to go apply for a job, they're not hiring people, and
   they're not paying that much to even go to work," she said. Children,
   she said, have "nothing better to do than to get on drugs."

   While racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to live in poverty,
   race disparities in the poverty rate have narrowed substantially since
   the 1970s, census data show. Economic insecurity among whites also is
   more pervasive than is shown in the government's poverty data,
   engulfing more than 76 percent of white adults by the time they turn
   60, according to a new economic gauge being published next year by the
   Oxford University Press.

   The gauge defines "economic insecurity" as experiencing unemployment at
   some point in their working lives, or a year or more of reliance on
   government aid such as food stamps or income below 150 percent of the
   poverty line. Measured across all races, the risk of economic
   insecurity rises to 79 percent.

   Marriage rates are in decline across all races, and the number of white
   mother-headed households living in poverty has risen to the level of
   black ones.

   "It's time that America comes to understand that many of the nation's
   biggest disparities, from education and life expectancy to poverty, are
   increasingly due to economic class position," said William Julius
   Wilson, a Harvard professor who specializes in race and poverty. He
   noted that despite continuing economic difficulties, minorities have
   more optimism about the future after Obama's election, while struggling
   whites do not.

   "There is the real possibility that white alienation will increase if
   steps are not taken to highlight and address inequality on a broad
   front," Wilson said.

   Nationwide, the count of America's poor remains stuck at a record
   number: 46.2 million, or 15 percent of the population, due in part to
   lingering high unemployment following the recession. While poverty
   rates for blacks and Hispanics are nearly three times higher, by
   absolute numbers the predominant face of the poor is white.

   More than 19 million whites fall below the poverty line of $23,021 for
   a family of four, accounting for more than 41 percent of the nation's
   destitute, nearly double the number of poor blacks.

   Sometimes termed "the invisible poor" by demographers, lower-income
   whites generally are dispersed in suburbs as well as small rural towns,
   where more than 60 percent of the poor are white. Concentrated in
   Appalachia in the East, they are numerous in the industrial Midwest and
   spread across America's heartland, from Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma
   up through the Great Plains.

   Buchanan County, in southwest Virginia, is among the nation's most
   destitute based on median income, with poverty hovering at 24 percent.
   The county is mostly white, as are 99 percent of its poor.

   More than 90 percent of Buchanan County's inhabitants are working-class
   whites who lack a college degree. Higher education long has been seen
   there as nonessential to land a job because well-paying mining and
   related jobs were once in plentiful supply. These days many residents
   get by on odd jobs and government checks.

   Salyers' daughter, Renee Adams, 28, who grew up in the region, has two
   children. A jobless single mother, she relies on her live-in
   boyfriend's disability checks to get by. Salyers says it was tough
   raising her own children as it is for her daughter now, and doesn't
   even try to speculate what awaits her grandchildren, ages 4 and 5.

   Smoking a cigarette in front of the produce stand, Adams later
   expresses a wish that employers will look past her conviction a few
   years ago for distributing prescription painkillers, so she can get a
   job and have money to "buy the kids everything they need."

   "It's pretty hard," she said. "Once the bills are paid, we might have
   $10 to our name."

   Census figures provide an official measure of poverty, but they're only
   a temporary snapshot that doesn't capture the makeup of those who cycle
   in and out of poverty at different points in their lives. They may be
   suburbanites, for example, or the working poor or the laid off.

   In 2011 that snapshot showed 12.6 percent of adults in their prime
   working-age years of 25-60 lived in poverty. But measured in terms of a
   person's lifetime risk, a much higher number - 4 in 10 adults - falls
   into poverty for at least a year of their lives.

   The risks of poverty also have been increasing in recent decades,
   particularly among people ages 35-55, coinciding with widening income
   inequality. For instance, people ages 35-45 had a 17 percent risk of
   encountering poverty during the 1969-1989 time period; that risk
   increased to 23 percent during the 1989-2009 period. For those ages
   45-55, the risk of poverty jumped from 11.8 percent to 17.7 percent.

   Higher recent rates of unemployment mean the lifetime risk of
   experiencing economic insecurity now runs even higher: 79 percent, or 4
   in 5 adults, by the time they turn 60.

   By race, nonwhites still have a higher risk of being economically
   insecure, at 90 percent. But compared with the official poverty rate,
   some of the biggest jumps under the newer measure are among whites,
   with more than 76 percent enduring periods of joblessness, life on
   welfare or near-poverty.

   By 2030, based on the current trend of widening income inequality,
   close to 85 percent of all working-age adults in the U.S. will
   experience bouts of economic insecurity.

   "Poverty is no longer an issue of `them', it's an issue of `us'," says
   Mark Rank, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who
   calculated the numbers. "Only when poverty is thought of as a
   mainstream event, rather than a fringe experience that just affects
   blacks and Hispanics, can we really begin to build broader support for
   programs that lift people in need."

   The numbers come from Rank's analysis being published by the Oxford
   University Press. They are supplemented with interviews and figures
   provided to the AP by Tom Hirschl, a professor at Cornell University;
   John Iceland, a sociology professor at Penn State University; the
   University of New Hampshire's Carsey Institute; the Census Bureau; and
   the Population Reference Bureau.

   Among the findings:

   _For the first time since 1975, the number of white single-mother
   households living in poverty with children surpassed or equaled black
   ones in the past decade, spurred by job losses and faster rates of
   out-of-wedlock births among whites. White single-mother families in
   poverty stood at nearly 1.5 million in 2011, comparable to the number
   for blacks. Hispanic single-mother families in poverty trailed at 1.2
   million.

   _Since 2000, the poverty rate among working-class whites has grown
   faster than among working-class nonwhites, rising 3 percentage points
   to 11 percent as the recession took a bigger toll among lower-wage
   workers. Still, poverty among working-class nonwhites remains higher,
   at 23 percent.

   _The share of children living in high-poverty neighborhoods - those
   with poverty rates of 30 percent or more - has increased to 1 in 10,
   putting them at higher risk of teenage pregnancy or dropping out of
   school. Non-Hispanic whites accounted for 17 percent of the child
   population in such neighborhoods, compared with 13 percent in 2000,
   even though the overall proportion of white children in the U.S. has
   been declining.

   The share of black children in high-poverty neighborhoods dropped from
   43 percent to 37 percent, while the share of Latino children went from
   38 percent to 39 percent.

   _Race disparities in health and education have narrowed generally since
   the 1960s. While residential segregation remains high, a typical black
   person now lives in a nonmajority black neighborhood for the first
   time. Previous studies have shown that wealth is a greater predictor of
   standardized test scores than race; the test-score gap between rich and
   low-income students is now nearly double the gap between blacks and
   whites.

   Going back to the 1980s, never have whites been so pessimistic about
   their futures, according to the General Social Survey, a biannual
   survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. Just 45 percent
   say their family will have a good chance of improving their economic
   position based on the way things are in America.

   The divide is especially evident among those whites who self-identify
   as working class. Forty-nine percent say they think their children will
   do better than them, compared with 67 percent of nonwhites who consider
   themselves working class, even though the economic plight of minorities
   tends to be worse.

   Although they are a shrinking group, working-class whites - defined as
   those lacking a college degree - remain the biggest demographic bloc of
   the working-age population. In 2012, Election Day exit polls conducted
   for the AP and the television networks showed working-class whites made
   up 36 percent of the electorate, even with a notable drop in white
   voter turnout.

   Last November, Obama won the votes of just 36 percent of those
   noncollege whites, the worst performance of any Democratic nominee
   among that group since Republican Ronald Reagan's 1984 landslide
   victory over Walter Mondale.

   Some Democratic analysts have urged renewed efforts to bring
   working-class whites into the political fold, calling them a potential
   "decisive swing voter group" if minority and youth turnout level off in
   future elections. "In 2016 GOP messaging will be far more focused on
   expressing concern for `the middle class' and `average Americans,'"
   Andrew Levison and Ruy Teixeira wrote recently in The New Republic.

   "They don't trust big government, but it doesn't mean they want no
   government," says Republican pollster Ed Goeas, who agrees that
   working-class whites will remain an important electoral group. His
   research found that many of them would support anti-poverty programs if
   focused broadly on job training and infrastructure investment. This
   past week, Obama pledged anew to help manufacturers bring jobs back to
   America and to create jobs in the energy sectors of wind, solar and
   natural gas.

   "They feel that politicians are giving attention to other people and
   not them," Goeas said.

   After reading through some of these posts I see so many of you STILL
   think that the hard times and poverty we are experiencing is just a
   product of a down economy and if somehow we could create more jobs
   everything would be OK... This is like the Ostrich putting it's head in
   the sand. So many of you have been so ignorant to what has happened to
   us as a nation that you cannot see what has happened or how we
   [286] Read More... got like this.
   There are a wide variety of people who come here to vent and express
   opinion and there are many who come here simply to agitate and aren't
   interested in learning anything. For those of you really interested in
   why there is such a disparity between the haves and the havenots in
   this country go back 100 years, you have the internet in front of you
   search out economic decisions and their results. You will find that
   early in the 20th century was the first time that the elite tried to
   take control of society to the point where they alone had the power to
   choose winners and losers. Men like Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson,
   Franklin D Roosevelt managed to prevent this and develop a system of
   governance and economics that benefited everyone.
   Fast forward to the early 1970's and the greed and desire of the elites
   and their nationalist allies had determined that they had enough of the
   great society and were losing to much power and profit to the class of
   people created as a result of it... The great middle class. In their
   arrogance they decided that only they should be determining the
   direction of this country and that it's resources should serve them
   instead of being wasted on the many in society that they deemed
   "inferior". A 50 year strategy was devised that would turn around every
   societal advance made by those early Progressives and would leave the
   powerful in charge with no way to oppose them, a fundamental overthrow
   of the American democracy.
   It was to begin with Nixon and it indeed was developed by the men
   working around him. Nixon however, did not understand the need to be
   covert and patient and thus a scandal developed that prevented real
   implementation of the effort to take control until 1980. At this point
   the GOP was completely under control of certain elites and the GOP was
   all in with their agenda which promised to end in a two class society
   with them permanently representing the ruling class. First, control the
   people (sheep) through a separate media owned and controlled by the
   movement, second, bring the government to bankruptcy and blame it on
   social welfare programs, third, Break the power of the labor unions,
   fourth restrict the vote....  Sound familiar? look at what was done to
   break the unions and eliminate high wage skill jobs during the early
   2000's and late 90's... there is your clue to why you

   Who else can invent jobs that aren't really necessary, but pay real

   At least the dividends go back to the workers if there is any profit

   A just government isn't impossible.
   As much as we are afraid of it, we must quickly gravitate to it.
   The free enterprise profiteers are motivated by self centered greed.
   More now than ever...if it was not always so.
   We have been fooled by them to believe a just government is to be
   afraid of.
   A just government isn't a dream....it will happen, due to necessity if
   no other reason
   Historically speaking, capitalism flowers quickly to allure and then
   soon becomes wilted waste due to greed and everything we already
   know...

   So many reasons for this.
   And for anyone to think corporations care about people more than the
   government is laughable.
   Corporations will first try to make money off of people who have
   money....then they will work their way down to where they will eat

   A corporation is nothing but a money eating machine.

   I can relate to this. Although I make a very high income, I live in Los
   Angeles and after all my expenses and tightening of my belt, I am
   breaking even paycheck to paycheck. I have a few months worth of a
   nestegg and my job is unstable for the near future. It often takes over
   a year to find a replacement job so that means I lose this I lose
   everything. I already came out of a foreclosure and bankruptcy under
   the Bush recession so I lost everything already including my life
   savings, 401k, credit, everything. I think many millions of people are
   in a similar position to me. What the heck happened to our country? I
   have noticed it from the year 2000 forward, but I know this was
   building up since the 80's.

   We need principled and patriotic business people in this Country,
   committed to HELPING
   America and starting up companies . We don't need for them to relocate
   (businesses and themselves personally ) OVERSEAS . Then we need a
   government that actually
   helps bring this about instead of making it more difficult . 75% of all
   jobs are
   in the small business sector . What has Obama done to help ( and
   Democrats
   in States like CA ) ? They put obstacle after obstacle in their way .
   Then we need to close the border . We simply cannot absorb all the
   people who
   want to come here illegally without harming the lives of the people
   already here
   and draining our public services resources - already severely strained
   by the
   Great Recession .

   I partially agree with you, especially on offshoring of jobs and
   factories overseas. There is zero excuse for this and instead of
   offering offshore tax credits to corporations who offshore which the
   republican party is forcing upon us and refuses to allow the democrats
   to end it, we should instead be heavily tax penalizing corporations who
   offshore. Regarding Obama, he has pushed a jobs bill which died, he is
   pushing to return manufacturing to America the republicans refuse to
   make this a reality, and the congress refuses to pass even a single
   jobs bill or a manufacturing industry rescue bill.
   Where I do hold Obama responsible right now is not fighting the
   republicans over this day after day in the media and building pressure
   to force them to pass jobs bills and return manufacturing. Working on a
   war in Syria is the wrong thing to do.

   jobs overseas? Why won't you pay a living wage and increase the minimum

   They ignore the fact that the best job in the world was aggressively

   I hope every black person who reads racist republican comments goes and

   These types of comments are an embarrassment to white people. I am
   white and I am ashamed of you for making a comment like this. For ALL
   unemployed, blacks, whites, latinos, they need jobs to be available for
   them to take. Thank God Obama saved the auto industry which created a
   quarter million jobs and saved 1.2 million jobs. What we need is to
   return the entire manufacturing industry back to America and this
   includes call centers and end h1 visa imported workers. If you take a
   poor black town or a poor white town and you offshore their factories
   overseas, what motivation is there for most of the residents to find a
   job or to get an education when there is nothing but despair and
   poverty waiting? Factory jobs will provide a middle class lifestyle and
   will save entire communities and cities. So republicans stop calling
   the unemployed names and join us on jobs bills or shut the f up.

   You'd fit right in a fascist organization like the Golden Dawn of
   Greece. It's the 1 percent and the banksters that destroyed our
   economy, not the poor and downtrodden on the margins of society. Upon
   reading your post I was reminded of something Chris Hedges said about
   proto-fascist movements, particularly the Tea Party:
   "A protofascist movement that coalesces around a mystical nationalism,
   that fuses the symbols of the country with those of Christianity, that
   denigrates reason and elevates mass emotions will have broad appeal. It
   will offer to followers a leap from the deep pit of despair and
   frustration to the heights of utopia. It will speak in the language of
   violence and demonize the vulnerable, from undocumented workers to
   homosexuals to people of color to liberals to the poor. And this force,
   financed by the most retrograde elements of corporate capitalism, could
   usher in a species of corporate fascism in a period of economic or
   environmental instability."
