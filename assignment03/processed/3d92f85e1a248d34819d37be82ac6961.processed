What Do We Forget When We Remember History?

   Over the summer Code Switch has been [26]live tweeting events from 50
   years ago as though they were just now unfolding. We hoped to bring our
   audience the look and feel of that era in a way that complemented the
   anniversary stories we've been doing all year.

   In our first editorial meetings about the project we wondered, Will
   there be enough material? No doubt it had been a summer full of heroic
   acts and simple, powerful protest, but what we were most familiar with
   were the summer's major characters and moments: the events in
   Birmingham, Medgar Evers' killing, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the
   Kennedys, the March on Washington. What about those moments in between?
   What would we "cover"? What would we link to?

   If you know the history of that summer you won't be surprised to learn
   that there was plenty to choose from. Historical events become
   compressed in the retelling, leaving out the minor characters and
   moments that made great figures who they were. Every day as I looked at
   headlines in the news archives I found some of those moments.

   By some counts, those three months of summer saw over a thousand
   protests. [27]Updates like these from UPI, [28]summarizing events as
   far apart as Kansas City, Mo., and Stamford, Conn., were fairly
   typical.

   It was an enormous movement with many parts, and there was copious
   newspaper coverage to link to. Right away it seemed we had started
   leaving a lot of compelling stories out of the feed. So what about that
   granularity? Say for a minute we had included all of those stories ‚
   even small newspapers that weren't digitally archived ‚ would even that
   have been faithful to the experience?

   It seemed like a question for a historian. I asked William Chafe,
   professor of history at Duke University, about the time. He told me
   about a movement that was driven by the actions of individuals all
   around the country, more than any one leader. And the story of that
   movement was one many white-owned newspapers weren't interested in
   telling.

   Take Greensboro, N.C., as an example. (Chafe wrote about the city in
   his book [29]Civilities and Civil Rights: Greensboro, N.C., and the
   Struggle for Black Freedom.) This was the place where four young men
   who were enrolled at North Carolina A&T first conceived of the sit-in
   as a form of protest. (Many years later, the Smithsonian removed a
   piece of the former Woolworth's counter where the sit-in occurred to
   add to the permanent collection.)

   "Oh, we didn't have a reporter on that," former Greensboro Daily News
   reporters told Chafe when he asked about the paper's coverage of the
   civil rights movement. A similar response came when he asked them who
   they thought the leaders of the black community were at the time. (Keep
   in mind that this place gave rise to Jesse Jackson.) "That gives you an
   idea of how ignorant the white press was," Chafe said.

   These types of omissions are well-noted. After my conversation with
   Chafe I remembered the [30]clarification run by the Lexington (Ky.)
   Herald-Leader 40 years after the signing of the Civil Rights Act of
   1964. It read, "It has come to the editor's attention that the
   Herald-Leader neglected to cover the civil rights movement. ... We
   regret the omission."

   [31]As Audie Cornish told us earlier this summer, what did get printed
   in Southern papers was often written by outsiders and printed in the
   back pages.

   So then we come back to [32]@todayin1963, and our effort to re-create
   the daily drama that people at the time felt. We had found very quickly
   that there was more than enough for daily mention. Many details and
   plot lines were even left out of our telling. Still, there was
   something even greater missing from the story.

   Journalism is often referred to as "the first draft of history." In
   this case, that draft was incomplete. In some places it was grotesquely
   warped by the prejudice of newspaper owners and writers. In others, it
   simply failed to capture the stories of those who were not major
   characters ‚ at least, not with any detail. The result is a record
   that, as fascinating as it is, doesn't come close to including the
   innumerable important moments that made up the summer of 1963.

   Fifty years from now, when researchers scour through tweets and other
   reports from our times, I wonder if the unprecedented detail will help
   them understand the story. What will they see? What will they miss?
