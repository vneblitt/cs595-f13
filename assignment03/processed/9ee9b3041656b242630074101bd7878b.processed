Student athletic trainers keep Hokie athletes moving

   BLACKSBURG, Va., April 18, 2013 - Long before "Enter Sandman" echoes
   through Lane Stadium and football players huddle up for their first
   play, James Kiefer of Baltimore, a senior majoring in [160]human
   nutrition, foods and exercise, in the College of Agriculture and Life
   Sciences is hard at work.

   Kiefer is busy taping injured ankles, molding mouth guards, and doing
   whatever else it takes to help get the Hokies ready for a big game.

   He is one of more than 50 student athletic trainers from the Department
   of Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise in the [161]College of
   Agriculture and Life Sciences who help Virginia Tech sports teams excel
   while gaining valuable experience for their own careers. Kiefer, for
   example, is headed to dental school after he gradates in May. Human
   nutrition, foods and exercise majors make up the bulk of Virginia
   Tech's student athletic trainers.

   With the spring football game coming up and sports ranging from
   baseball to track in full swing, the athletic trainers are busy keeping
   Virginia Tech athletes on the move.

   "Students love this program because it gives them hands-on experience
   that they can't gain anywhere else," said Renee Selberg-Eaton, the
   undergraduate program director for human nutrition, foods and exercise.
   "Many of our students go on to be doctors, physician assistants,
   physical therapists, and professional athletic trainers, and they say
   that their experience here was invaluable."

   Mike Goforth, associate director of athletics for sports medicine,
   teaches a course during the program, which is coordinated by Katie
   Baer, a certified athletic trainer. Though students can receive up to
   three credits for their work as athletic trainers, some continue to
   work with the teams long after they have earned their credits because
   they like it so much.

   Many, like Colleen Bannigan of Herndon, Va., a junior majoring in human
   nutrition, foods and exercise, were high school athletes who know what
   it was like to suffer injuries while playing sports. Bannigan, a former
   basketball and soccer player, broke 10 bones during her childhood.

   "I was always the one in the training room, so I can relate to the
   athletes really well," said Bannigan, a student athletic trainer for
   the women's soccer team.

   Bannigan says she wants to be an orthopedic surgeon for a professional
   sports team and is already seeing the benefits of her experience. She's
   been the first responder to athletes who have suffered knee injuries
   and was able to watch a surgery firsthand. Her goal is to get an
   internship in the athletic department of a National Football League
   team.

   "This isn't just fun -- it is a great experience that is paying off,"
   she said in between giving ultrasounds to athletes and stocking water
   bottles.

   Michael Cosgrove of Fairfax, Va., a junior majoring in human nutrition,
   foods and exercise, works with the swim team, which means being in the
   locker rooms before most students are awake. But for Cosgrove, who
   wants to go into physical therapy or athletic training, the experience
   is priceless.

   "I grew up playing sports," he said. "So this is a great way to be
   involved with something I care about while helping further my academic
   career."

   Nationally ranked among the top research institutions of its kind,
   Virginia Tech's [164]College of Agriculture and Life Sciences focuses
   on the science and business of living systems through learning,
   discovery, and engagement. The college's comprehensive curriculum gives
   more than 3,100 students in a dozen academic departments a balanced
   education that ranges from food and fiber production to economics to
   human health. Students learn from the world's leading agricultural
   scientists, who bring the latest science and technology into the
   classroom.
