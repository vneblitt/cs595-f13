[27]Study: no connection between drinking alcohol early in pregnancy and
birth problems

   Glass of red wine

   In a new study sure to raise hackles and controversy, an international
   team of researchers is reporting that pregnant women who drink alcohol
   during the first trimester of pregnancy and possibly beyond aren't
   putting their babies at risk for premature birth or low birth weight,
   or themselves at risk for high blood pressure complications during
   pregnancy.

   Dr. Fergus McCarthy and colleagues from Ireland, England, New Zealand,
   and Australia compared birth outcomes among 5,628 women who were
   pregnant for the first time between 2004 and 2011. More than half of
   them reported drinking alcohol during the first three months of
   pregnancy. Some (19%) reported occasionally drinking alcohol.
   Twenty-five percent reported low alcohol consumption, or three to seven
   drinks per week ("a drink" defined as a glass of wine or a little less
   than a 12-ounce bottle of beer). Another 15% reported having more than
   seven drinks per week.

   Rates of premature birth, babies with low birth weight or small size,
   and preeclampsia--a potentially life-threatening condition in which a
   pregnant woman develops high blood pressure--were similar across the
   alcohol consumption categories

   The study did not measure the effect of drinking alcohol during
   pregnancy on development after birth. The results were published online
   [29]ahead of print in the October issue of the journal Obstetrics &
   Gynecology.

The potential hazard of alcohol during pregnancy

   For the past few decades, women have been urged to avoid alcohol during
   pregnancy. Respected medical societies like the American College of
   Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the United Kingdom's Royal College
   of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Women both say women shouldn't
   drink any alcohol during pregnancy. The main reason for this is that
   heavy use of alcohol during pregnancy has been linked to a long-term
   and irreversible condition known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).

   Babies with FAS may be born early. They are often underweight and don't
   grow well. Some have characteristic facial features like a thin upper
   lip and small eye openings, or the small vertical groove between the
   upper lip and the nose may be flattened. Other physical signs that go
   along with fetal alcohol syndrome include a small head, short nose, and
   problems with the way the heart or the joints are formed.

   Children with FAS are slower to learn language skills than other kids.
   When they reach school age they often have learning disabilities and
   difficulty with attention, memory and hyperactivity. They are more
   likely to have poor coordination and a hard time with problem-solving.
   And some have trouble making friends and relating to other kids. All of
   which can make school a really difficult time.

   Despite this clear advice, up to half of women drink alcohol during
   pregnancy.

Putting it into practice

   How clear is the medical evidence supporting strict abstinence from
   alcohol during pregnancy? Not very strong. And recent studies suggest
   pregnant women who have an occasional drink don't harm themselves or
   their baby. [30]A 2012 Danish study, for example, found that low to
   moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy did not affect executive
   functioning among 5-year-olds. Executive functioning is a catchall term
   that describes the ability to perform activities such as planning,
   organizing, strategizing, remembering details, and managing time.

   Keep in mind that moderate drinking means no more than one drink per
   day.

   Since it's not clear how much alcohol it takes to cause problems, the
   best advice remains the same: women should avoid alcohol if they are
   pregnant or might become pregnant.

   Many women are pregnant for a while before they know it. Does their
   alcohol consumption during the time they were pregnant but didn't
   realize it doom their child? No. They almost surely did no harm to
   their unborn children.

   Not everyone agrees that you should avoid all alcohol if you are trying
   to get pregnant. Some respected health agencies, like the [31]United
   Kingdom's Department of Health, indicate that having one alcoholic
   beverage a couple times per week during pregnancy is okay.

   Looking at the evidence, a strict recommendation to have zero alcohol
   during pregnancy seems extreme. Will there be consensus about whether
   it's safe for a pregnant woman to have a glass of wine or a beer once
   or twice a week? I don't think we will see that any time soon.

       I absolutely agree! I have been observing the situation. My thought
       (unproven) is that FAS hits the next generation, not the initial.
       Mary drinks during pregnancy and gives birth to a healthy baby
       girl, Joyce. Joyce drinks during pregnancy and may give birth to a
       healthy baby girl, Darlene. Darlene drinks during pregnancy and
       gives birth to a child with FAS.
       I believe that alcohol during pregnancy might damage DNA. But there
       are also many environmental causes to damaged DNA.
       I would like to see further research done on this. I believe there
       is a different truth out there.

       I'm disappointed that Harvard would even take time to acknowledge a
       study like this. I don't think any women should be drinking while
       pregnant, even if it is one drink per day. An ordinary person has a
       different perception on what one drink means. For one person it can
       mean 12 oz while others it can be more like 24 oz. I think putting
       this study out there while there is not an approved safe amount of
       alcohol for women may promote or encourage women to drink while
       pregnant.

       I think it is better to stay away from drinking alcohol during
       pregnancy in order to avoid any risk to the fetus This is my
       opinion

       I am so disappointed to see that Harvard Medical spreading
       information that could cause a lifetime brain damage to a fetus and
       jeopardizing international effort leaded by NIAAA! The study
       mentioned in the article is still unpublished and if it would be
       published it will get its harvest. Majority of studies around the
       World show us that we are severely underestimating this risk. Yes,
       there is chance to have a healthy looking baby and the rest of your
       lives wonder why he or she behaves so unsocial. And weather this
       kids could become Einstein, Curie or Mozart if only Mom was not
       surrounded by "kindly permissive" media and aggressive alcohol
       advertising.

       This information is good to reduce worry for woman who just
       realized pregnant.
       Other wise, alcohol is still not good.
       thanks
