   Labor Day 2013 is special. This year marks the [295]centennial of the
   U.S. Department of Labor -- 100 years of working for America's workers.
   And this past week, our nation reaffirmed the ideals of the 1963 March
   on Washington. This transformational event, exactly 50 years ago, was
   just as much about labor rights as it was about civil rights.

   For me, just like so many others then and now, these two movements are
   inextricably intertwined, their interests converging time and time
   again, their goals united in creating opportunity for all.

              IFRAME: [296]//www.youtube.com/embed/mcfwWsQGTE4

   For a guy like me who grew up in an immigrant family from Buffalo, the
   past few days have been pretty heady. At the Lincoln Memorial
   Wednesday, I couldn't help but wonder if The Rev. Martin Luther King
   Jr. ever imagined that half a century after he stood on these steps,
   another African-American man would stand there -- as president?

   For a moment, I celebrated how far we have come. And then I remembered
   that we also have a long journey still to complete.

   I couldn't help but wonder what was going on at the Labor Department 50
   years ago. What was my predecessor doing and thinking, as the March on
   Washington began right outside his office windows, and on the eve of
   Labor Day 1963?

   Well, it turns out, President Kennedy's labor secretary, Willard Wirtz,
   was in the thick of it. Immediately after the march, Wirtz joined
   Kennedy and Vice President Johnson at an Oval Office meeting with Dr.
   King and other march leaders. A few days later, over Labor Day weekend,
   Wirtz was asked on a Sunday news talk show what was "most urgently on
   the minds" of the marchers. He replied: "Equality of opportunity in
   general, but the necessity particularly of equality of opportunity for
   work."

   Opportunity. Then and now, it's about opportunity.

   Fifty years later, on my first Labor Day as labor secretary, I'll be
   going on talk shows to discuss opportunity, too. In fact, I want
   everyone to see the U.S. Department of Labor as the "Department of
   Opportunity."

   For 100 years, the department has played a critical role in creating
   opportunity and moving the nation forward. Our grit and determination
   has been put to the test recently, as we've endured the most crippling
   recession in 80 years.

   We've turned a corner, thanks in large measure to the vision of the
   president and the work of the Labor Department. We're creating jobs
   again, unemployment is at its lowest since 2008, and our economy
   continues to grow as we provide affordable health care for every
   American.

   But again, there is still so much more to do ... in skills training and
   education, workplace safety and health, retirement security and job
   creation. And in particular, we must do more to ensure an honest day's
   pay for an honest day's work.

   People who work full-time in America should not have to live in poverty
   -- simple as that. Too many jobs don't pay enough to get by, let alone
   get ahead. Too many people are finding the rungs on the ladder of
   opportunity further and further apart. Workers around the country are
   bravely raising their collective voice and taking action to demand fair
   wages. We need to hear these voices. They are acting in the proud
   tradition of the marchers 50 years ago who took action for justice and
   dignity.

   In his Wednesday speech, President Obama challenged us to address
   widening income inequality that is eroding the American Dream, invoking
   the marchers of 50 years ago who were engaged in that same struggle for
   economic justice. I join the president in the call for a higher minimum
   wage. It's not just a moral imperative; it's economic common sense.
   When we put more money in working families' pockets, it boosts consumer
   demand, helping small businesses and jump-starting the entire economy.

   Let's use Labor Day 2013 as an opportunity to reflect on the men and
   women whose heads, hearts and hands have made ours the strongest
   economy the world has ever known.

   Let's spend this day honoring those who marched then, and those who
   march now. Let's draw inspiration from their stories; emulate their
   strength and resolve; summon their dignity and courage.

   Let's do right by them.

   And let's create more opportunity for more working people in the years
   ahead.

   This guy is bad news. A man who uses false claims of racism to gain
   settlements, and when someone goes to bring a case to court testing the
   validity of his argument. He buys them off....to get the case not
   heard.

   So my private sector union negotiates health benefits for us -- good,
   right? We secure a solid health plan from our employer -- good, right?
   Then the ACA tells us we negotiated too well, ou health plan is a
   "cadillac plan." And we have to pay 40% tax on it, starting 2018 --
   bad, right. You can't celebrate Labor Day and support the ACA. The ACA
   penalizes our union negotiated plan.

   First off I am a 30+ year union person who is a shop steward and
   negotiating committee member. I have walked the picket line twice. My
   father was union, my mother wasn't although it was because she was an
   industrial nurse who only made the money she did because of the union.
   My brother is also union.
   I bleed workers rights but I also have two business degrees so I
   understand the full spectrum of the issues.
   Your plan will be gone by then. My current plan will also. No employers
   will be able to afford them anymore and everyone in this country will
   all get basically the same health care - EXCEPT the wealthy and
   politicians. Even illegals will get it because they will get amnesty
   and will no longer be illegal. Kind of like saying all other convicted
   criminals will have their records cleared so employers will have no way
   to know if they are hiring felons.
   Essentially that means it doesn't matter how hard you work for it or
   what you have given up to get those plans over the years the
   politicians feel that anyone on welfare should get the same medical
   care as those of us who work for it do.
   It is the end of an era in this country and the beginning of another
   one where decades of hard work pays no more than not working.

   The ACA does more damage than that even. The ACA plus S.744 gives
   employers here in the U.S. a serious incentive to hire foreign workers
   instead of Americans.
   [359]http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/27/mccain-immigration
   -bill-could-give-foreign-workers/?utm_source=feedly
   "Two Republicans who helped write the Senate's immigration bill said
   Tuesday that they are convinced it will finally be able to get a handle
   on the porous southwestern border -- but acknowledged it could mean
   problems for American workers.
   Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, both Arizona Republicans, said they
   fear that foreign workers will be more attractive to hire than
   Americans for some companies because the foreigners won't be eligible
   for the same health care benefits."
   For high-wage workers it might be less of an incentive to hire foreign
   nationals but for low-wage workers it will be a big difference. The
   mandate has been delayed until 2015 but employers hiring for beyond the
   short term know that the mandate is coming and that it benefits them
   directly to hire foreign nationals over Americans.

   The Dems have nothing but words for labor anymore, and even their words
   are weak now. Did you notice that he blabbed about increasing the
   minimum wage - but neglected to offer a number for what the minimum
   wage should be?
   That's because Obama proposed a whopping $2 increase - not even enough
   to lift an earner out from under the poverty level.
   The working class is on the ropes and there is no help in sight. The
   Dems current pitiful performance on domestic and foreign affairs means
   they won't pick up many seats in the house for 2014 and the Dems will
   do their best to nominate a former Walmart board board member for
   president in 2016.
   Working people need to stick together, support each others strikes and
   keep reminding ourselves of the words of Abraham Lincoln:
   "Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the
   fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first
   existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher
   consideration."

   ED: The Democrats are promoting the unnecessary "immigration reform" so
   that more foreign workers can be imported into the U.S. Most of the
   Republican leadership that receives their funding from the U.S. Chamber
   of Lobbyists is for that also. The American workers only hope are those
   few Republicans in the House that will vote against the CIR Bill. US
   needs two "third parties" that are FOR Americans instead of the

   A good dept of labor head would do a cost analysis of his department
   and cut all the subsidies and programs that are failures. So many of
   the jobs training programs costing tax payers billion per years have
   been proven failures so why don't you cut them out and save us

   The Dept of Labor spends approx $20 billion yearly on jobs programs.
   That $20 billion equals 0.6% of US outlays.
   Do you lay awake nights worrying about 0.6% of federal expenditures?
   And what makes you think that they are "proven failures"? Please
   provide a credible reference.

   The past few administrations have done nothing but demonize workers and
   unions. I'd love to see ONE of these politicians live on minimum wage
   with no health or paid sick time, often in unhealthy to outright deadly
   environment with no job protection. Instead, they ALL take money from
   the 'job creators' too continue to undermine our own right to be able
   to live on what we're paid. A fair working wage was what built this
   country. Unfair practices are what's destroying it. Simply put, there's
   a large group of greedy people ruling this country with an iron fist
   and that's NOT a democracy.

   EPA and OSHA, both established by republican presidents, protects
   workers rights and environmental conditions. If you take a teenager job
   and get teenager pay, then you must assume to live like a teenager.
   If you have no skills nor value to sell as labor, then you get entry
   level pay.
   Your complaint, while seemingly noble, ignores the real problem:
   opportunity and growth. If there was opportunity and more jobs, then
   adults with experience would not be taking the entry level jobs trying
   to get by on teenager hourly rates.
   Obama has destroyed the middle class, ruptured the 40 hr work week, and
   left many with part time that pay much less. Now he has raised the
   price of all goods to further bankroll his pet projects that have no
   value to the middle class. Go talk to him.

   Mr. Secretary, the policies of the administration you have joined are
   actually impeding economic growth and job creation. If you want to make
   a lasting contribution, concentrate on what Washington should STOP
   doing, not how else it can get in the way.

   "People who work full-time in America should not have to live in
   poverty -- simple as that. Too many jobs don't pay enough to get by,
   let alone get ahead."
   This statement is simply wrong. Pay is not and should not be determined
   based on the hours you work or the effort involved. Income is and needs
   to be determined by the value you create for others. In reality you
   create value and trade it to your employer or customer. They have to
   value what you contribute more than the money they pay you.
   A simple example: Imagine you believe you are a talented artist and you
   spend hundreds of hours painting what you think are brilliant pieces of
   art. How is the value of that art ultimately determined? ANSWER: You
   offer your paintings for sale and see what others are willing to pay
   for them. Notice the price you can sell your art for has nothing to do
   with the hours it took you to create, but on how much other value what
   you created.
   That ultimately is how wages and income is determined and unless people
   develop the skills and abilities to create more value higher wages are
   unsustainable. Until people accept this reality they will continue to
   pursue divisive policies that damage rather than enhance the wealth
   creating ability of the US economy.

   Who thinks the US - ROTFLMAO - is a meritocracy. CEOs making a 1,000
   times what the lowest paid worker gets? WOW! They're really adding a
   lot of value!?!?
   "40% of top-paid CEOs busted, bailed out or booted, study says
   CEOs of U.S. large companies got about 354 times as much pay as the
   average American worker in 2012".

   There are 25 million unemployed Americans that are seeking full-time
   jobs and President Obama's administration wants Congress to pass the
   "Comprehensive Immigration Reform" bill that will allow the importation
   of MORE foreign workers! US needs millions-more full-time jobs with the
   corporations paying for their health insurance if Obamacare is going to
   work:

   The American fast food workers who are marching for higher wages are
   being set up by this administration to be fired to pave a way for the
   MORE foreign workers you have referenced. The foreign workers brought
   in by the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill will more than happy to
   receive and secure the jobs vacated by these workers. These workers
   concerned that ObamaCare will force them to pay and secure a health
   care plan that a 60 year old would require are panicking trying to
   recoup the additional funds by a raise in hourly pay. The public is not
   ready to pay 8 dollars for a fast food burger so their march is for
   nothing...
   It is a shame that this labor day will be remembered and stained as the
   day a sitting American President, his Affordable Care Act and his Labor
   Secretary all conspired to the destruction of the 40 hour work week in
   an effort of putting more people in the poor house to secure their
   votes..
