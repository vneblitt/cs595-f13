Industrial design students win international award for innovative cellphone
device operated by facial muscles

   A young man on stage speaking into a microphone. Cole Smith of
   Charlottesville, Va., accepts the Silver at the International User
   Experience Awards at Parsons the New School in New York City.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., July 29, 2013 - A team of rising juniors in the
   College of Architecture and Urban Studies' [160]Industrial Design
   program won a Silver for Best Accessibility Innovation in the 3rd
   Annual [161]International User Experience Awards.

   They were the only student team recognized in the international
   competition. Other notable winners included Google, and the students
   placed ahead of projects from major companies like BMW North America,
   Nike, and American Express.

   Their winning design, called Activ, was a class project created by
   three students in Assistant Professor [162]Akshay Sharma's second year
   studio course. Conor Brown of Blacksburg, Michelle Murgia, of
   Poolesville, Md., and Cole Smith of Charlottesville, Va., all
   industrial design majors in the College of Architecture and Urban
   Studies' [163]School of Architecture + Design, designed a solution that
   makes cell phone use easier for a person who has lost a limb due to a
   major injury.

   The scenario behind Activ's design was a woman who lost her dominant
   arm while in a war zone, and who returned to lead an active lifestyle
   and build a career in construction management. The team explored the
   problem by simulating what it would be like for someone in her shoes.
   In fact, each team member spent days going through their daily
   activities with one arm tied behind their back. Through that
   experience, they discovered that the biggest challenge they faced was
   not being able to multitask, something most cell phone users take for
   granted.

   Activ allows the users to operate their cellphone by clenching their
   jaw muscles, as demonstrated in the video entry they submitted to the
   competition.

   Cole Smith accepted the award on behalf of his team during the ceremony
   at Parsons the New School in New York City.


   "I think the best part of traveling to New York was understanding the
   magnitude of what my team had actually accomplished. None of us knew
   who the other winners were, so I assumed we had just won some sort of
   student competition. Learning that we were the only student winners --
   and won a second place award -- was pretty invigorating. This is the
   first professional-level award any of us have earned, so it's very
   exciting for all of us," said Smith.

   "I believe we won this award because of our focus on research. Each of
   us took a few days to a week using only one arm for all of our daily
   tasks, and this part of the project was really highlighted on stage
   during the awards. It means a lot to me that this extra effort on our
   part was recognized by outstanding professionals from Google and
   Mashable."

   Each year, students in Akshay Sharma and Professor [166]Mitzi Vernon's
   studios work with the [167]Wireless Rehabilitation Engineering Research
   Center to explore universal design in wireless technologies to make
   them more accessible for individuals with special needs.

   Each student team faced a specific accessibility challenge for which
   they needed to develop a design solution. In addition to the amputee
   scenario, those challenges included making cell phone use easier for
   individuals with macular degeneration, chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease, or a traumatic brain injury.

   Vernon and Sharma worked closely with one another throughout the
   process, and Brennon Bortz of San Jose, Calif., a doctoral student in
   the College of Engineering's Department of Computer Science whose
   research focuses on music, emotion, and affective computing served as
   an advisor for the project. [168]James Muller , an industrial designer
   for the Wireless Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center has been a
   point of contact for the design exercise for the last four years.

   This is the first time Sharma's students have entered these
   International User Experience Awards, and he is thrilled with the
   results. He also feels that the award is part of a larger picture,
   reflecting the excellence of the students and the education they are
   receiving.

   "It's not just this. We have been doing really well at the
   international level with our projects," said Sharma. "So I think it
   says a lot about our students, it says a lot about the pedagogy we
   apply here and the way we are utilizing the studio environment. We are
   creating an environment where they can think creatively."

   Virginia Tech's Industrial Design program is currently ranked third
   nationally by DesignIntelligence.

   Virginia Tech's [169]College of Architecture and Urban Studies is
   composed of four schools: the School of Architecture + Design,
   including architecture, industrial design, interior design and
   landscape architecture; the School of Public and International Affairs,
   including urban affairs and planning, public administration and policy
   and government and international affairs; the Myers-Lawson School of
   Construction, which includes building construction in the College of
   Architecture and Urban Studies and construction engineering management
   in the College of Engineering; and the School of the Visual Arts,
   including programs in studio art, visual communication and art history.
