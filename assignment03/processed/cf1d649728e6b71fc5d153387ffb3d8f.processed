   Press Conference in Little Ferry, NJ - August 20, 2013. (Transcript
   Below)
   HUD Secretary Donovan: Governor thank you. It is good to be back in New
   Jersey. I was married here, I worked here at one point, and it is a
   place that I love because it is part of my family as well. It is good
   to be back. I want to thank you for your leadership Governor, the mayor
   said earlier you have defined 'Jersey Strong.' And there have been
   moments, dark moments, through this storm and the recovery when you
   question how much harder can you go, how much father can you go, and
   watching your efforts has been inspiring to all of us. So, thank you
   very personally.
   Governor Christie: Thank you Shaun.
   HUD Secretary Donovan: From a -- at least a related to Jersey kind of
   guy. If I can't call myself a Jersey guy yet, maybe you can give me an
   official designation at some point.
   Governor Christie: We'll see what the next spat of money looks like and
   then we'll see.
   HUD Secretary Donovan: Okay, alright. How big the check is...
   Governor Christie: Yeah, how big the check is.
   HUD Secretary Donovan: ...maybe I can get there. That sounds...
   Governor Christie: We're negotiable.
   HUD Secretary Donovan: ...that's fair. That's fair.
