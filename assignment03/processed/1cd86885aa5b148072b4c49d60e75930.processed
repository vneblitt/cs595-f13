Paula Deen -- Extortionist Sentenced to 2 Years in Prison

   9/16/2013 2:01 PM PDT [29]BY TMZ STAFF
   Paula Deen
   Extortionist Sentenced
   2 Years in Prison
   Exclusive
   0916_paula_deen_tmz
   The man who allegedly attempted to extort $250,000 from Paula Deen has
   just been sentenced to 2 years in prison, TMZ has learned.
   As we reported, a man named Thomas Paculis contacted Deen's attorney
   claiming he would release "true and damning" information about the
   celebrity chef's n-word usage if he didn't receive a huge check. The
   FBI tracked Paculis down and he was subsequently arrested and charged
   with two counts of extortion.
   Paculis struck a plea bargain with prosecutors last month, agreeing to
   plead guilty to one count of extortion. In exchange, prosecutors
   dropped the remaining count.
   Paculis was sentenced today to 2 years in a Georgia prison, plus one
   year of supervised release and 40 hours community service. He has
   already been remanded into custody.
   Interestingly, the court also ordered Paculis to attend substance abuse
   counseling. We called Paculis' attorney to find out why -- so far, no
   word back.

   See.....
   TMZ and others jumped the 'Racist Bandwagon' and helped ruin this
   person's career over LIES, and TMZ helped.

   The 'Other' person that worked for her and claimed 'racism' is 'Also'
   found full of it!
   *
   TMZ... so where's your public apology??
   *
   Disgusting what people did, jump on someone without all the facts and
   ruin they're career.
   *
   FACTS FIRST people, please.
   Don't fall into the 'Finger Pointing Game' when you don't even know
   what's going on.

   She should be the one in prison. In England if you call someone
   derogatory name, your ass can be locked up. Zimmerman killed an
   innocent kid and was set free, this poor guy is serving 2 years for
   attempting to expose a pasty, ugly, bigot.
