S&P turns 'negative' on Chicago's financial outlook

   The Chicago area economy expanded last year but slightly lagged the
   average growth of metro areas nationwide. (Chris Sweda / Chicago

   Citing an upcoming increase in pension payments, Standard & Poor's
   Ratings Services revised the outlook on Chicago's A-plus general
   obligation rating to negative from stable.
   Using newly revised general obligation rating criteria, S&P on Friday
   changed the outlook on Chicago's A-plus general obligation rating to
   negative from stable.
   "We could lower the rating within the next two years if the city
   substantially draws down its reserves in an effort to increase its
   pension payments in line with state mandates, regardless of whatever
   relief the state legislature may provide," S&P said in a report.
   Under an Illinois law mandating actuarially required pension payments
   for police and fire retirement funds, Chicago's payment is projected to
   top $1 billion in fiscal 2015 from $483.4 million in fiscal 2014, which
   begins Jan. 1. Subsequent payments are expected to continue to climb,
   hitting $1.25 billion in fiscal 2020, according to a fiscal analysis
   released by the city in July.
   Without a dramatic increase in revenue, Chicago would need the Illinois
   Legislature to pass reforms to ease pension payments. However, state
   lawmakers have yet to come up with a solution to Illinois' $100 billion
   unfunded pension liability.
   The pension woes led Moody's Investors Service to drop Chicago's
   general obligation rating three notches to A3 with a negative outlook
   in July, while Fitch Ratings in June put the city's AA-minus rating on
   review for a possible downgrade.
   S&P noted the unfunded liability for Chicago's four retirement funds
   had grown to $19.4 billion in 2012 from $11.9 billion in 2009, with a
   funded level of just 35 percent. An 80 percent funded level is
   considered healthy.
   "At this time, the city's position is that it will continue to seek
   legislative support and labor concessions," the S&P report said. "Even
   if the city is able to smooth out the contributions, the increased
   costs will likely be an impediment to significant future budget
   surpluses."
   Kelley Quinn, a spokeswoman for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he is
   urging state lawmakers to find common ground on pension reform.
   "Mayor Emanuel has said for more than a year that without comprehensive
   pension relief from Springfield, municipalities such as Chicago would
   continue to receive negative reviews from rating agencies," she said.
   Springfield is the state capital.
   The credit rating agency said while Chicago enjoys a broad and diverse
   economy and home-rule powers over taxation, "its flexibility is limited
   by the city's reluctance to adjust taxes." It also pointed to "very
   weak budgetary performance" and high debt levels for the nation's
   third-largest city.
   The rating agency added that the city could retain its A-plus rating
   with a stable outlook if pension payments are made "while maintaining
   balanced budgetary performance and reserves at or near their current
   level."
   The outlook revision resulted from S&P's release last week of changes
   to its GO rating criteria, the rating agency said.
