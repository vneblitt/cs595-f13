   [25]Behind The Stories

Is This Heaven? No, It's Iowa.

   by Cara Philbin
   July 31, 2013 7:30 PM

   The NPR newsroom was recently abuzz with rumors that three political
   correspondents had fallen prey to certain nostalgia for the Hawkeye
   State, after murmurs of slow summer news cycle amidst a grid-locked
   Congress began percolating around the coffee machine.

   The tip-off came from an intern who'd been cornered by a White House
   correspondent sharing fond campaign memories from stops along miles of
   unassuming farmland dotted with purposeful, reliable cornfields. Soon
   word got out that a National Political correspondent had interrupted an
   editorial meeting with visions of pork chops big enough to have their
   own zip code and friendly locals offering sweet and savory pies of
   infinite flavors and textures.

   Before long, several sources had placed Washington Desk correspondent
   Brian Naylor casually perched on the desk of producer and resident
   chaperone Arnie Seipel, chiding: "Because where else would you rather
   be in the last week of July, than pedaling across Iowa?" (Some claim to
   have witnessed Naylor flutter a single micro brew in front of Seipel.)

   That's when the whole news staff became privy to an adventure of
   [26]pie-loving proportion.

   Scroll through photos and anecdotes of their journey from start to
   finish on the [29]Return to Iowa tumblr.

   Listen to the guys catch up with NPR Host David Greene on [30]Morning
   Edition and [31]Iowa Public Radio's Clay Masters.

   RAGBRAI Inventory
   Miles traveled: 405
   Mr. Pork Chops eaten: 11
   Flat tires: 2
   Minor crashes: 1

   Bottles of water consumed: 97
   Corn field restroom breaks: n/a*
   Friends made: 25,000

   *what happens in the corn, stays in the corn.

   And so began the voyage of NPR caucus-regulars [32]Don Gonyea,
   [33]Scott Horsley, and [34]Brian Naylor (under Seipel's enabling eye)
   to discover the great state of Iowa outside of an election year
   blitzkrieg. Under the alias [35]No Pie Refused, they ditched the
   campaign bus for bikes in Council Bluffs and joined up with the Des
   Moines RAGBRAI (Register's Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa) misfits for
   their annual, open-air bike extravaganza. Not a press credential in
   sight, this rag-tag group resurfaced 400+ miles away on the banks of
   the Mississippi River, telling tales of Cupid Shuffle dance parties and
   year-round Christmas parades; sharing snapshots of the Dallas County
   Beef Queen; and illuminating lessons on the practical value of novelty
   bike helmets.

   This is their story.**

   **Disclaimer: "Their" story includes many creative liberties taken by a
   mid-level publicist suffering from serious cabin fever.
