Day or night, driving while tired a leading cause of accidents

   BLACKSBURG, Va., April 15, 2013 - Get more sleep. Have another cup of
   coffee before you drive to school or work. It could save your life.

   A 100-car naturalistic driving study conducted by the Virginia Tech
   Transportation Institute has shown that fatigue is a cause of 20
   percent of crashes, rather than the 2 or 3 percent previously estimated
   based on surveys, simulator studies, and test tracks.

   And 18- to 20-year-olds account for significantly more fatigue-related
   crashes than any other age group. Adolescents' sleep patterns shift to
   later hours; however, the school day still tends to start early,
   resulting in daytime sleepiness. Older drivers can face similar issues
   with late nights and early work times, but have more experience coping
   with moderate fatigue - although, not always.

   "One of the most important results from the 100-car naturalistic
   driving study was the degree to which fatigue is a cause of accidents,"
   said [160]Charlie Klauer, group leader for teen risk and injury
   prevention at the transportation institute's [161]Center for Vulnerable
   Road User Safety.

   "A finding that surprised people is the prevalence of fatigue during
   the day. We found significantly more crashes/near crashes due to
   fatigue during the day than at night," she said.

   "The study allowed us, for the first time, to observe driver behavior
   just prior to a crash. In 20 percent of all crashes and 16 percent of
   all near crashes, the driver was showing fatigue. We saw eye-lid
   closure, head bobbing, severe loss of facial musculature, micro sleep -
   which is when your eyes drift shut and then pop up," said Klauer. "This
   was not just yawning. The drivers were asleep."

   One-hundred drivers who commuted into or out of the Northern
   Virginia/Washington, D.C., metropolitan area were initially recruited
   as primary drivers to have their vehicles instrumented or receive a
   leased vehicle instrumented for the study. Since other family members
   and friends would occasionally drive the instrumented vehicles, data
   were collected on 132 additional drivers.

   Researchers selected a larger sample of drivers below the age of 25,
   compared to the total population of drivers, and a sample that drove
   more than the average number of miles.

   The data acquisition system used for the 100-Car Study was developed by
   engineers at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. Sensors
   included five video channels, forward and rearward Vorad radar units,
   accelerometers, lane tracking software, and an in-vehicle network
   sensor. The cameras were mounted unobtrusively in order to facilitate
   naturalistic driving behavior.

   Researchers viewed more than 110,000 events in order to validate 10,548
   events - specifically, 82 crashes, including 13 where the data was
   incomplete; 761 near crashes; 8,295 incidents, such as braking hard for
   slowing or stopped traffic; and 1,423 non-conflict events, such as
   running a stop light with no traffic present.

   In addition, 20,000 randomly selected 6-second segments of video were
   viewed. Incidents of moderate to severe driver fatigue were noted,
   providing an estimate of the amount of time drivers were fatigued but
   were not involved in a crash or near-crash.

   The total number of subjects who were involved in fatigue-related
   crashes and near-crashes was 38, with 11 drivers accounting for 58
   percent of all the fatigue-related crashes and near-crashes.

   "Applying the findings to the population at-large, these results
   suggest that drivers are at a four times greater risk of a crash or
   near-crash if they choose to drive while fatigued," said Tom Dingus,
   director of the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. "That suggests
   that about 12 percent of all crashes and near-crashes in the population
   are attributable to fatigue."

   Analyses with the 100-car study database will continue, plus data from
   a new U.S. study, the Strategic Highway Research Program, with 2,000
   cars, will provide greater statistical power.

   In addition, new naturalistic driving studies focused on 16- to
   18-year-old drivers are now under way. A Naturalistic Teenage Driving
   Study, sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human
   Development, seeks to determine the effects of experience on driving
   performance, and the extent of variability in driving performance under
   specific driving conditions, such as at night. The National Highway
   Traffic Safety Administration provided additional funds to analyze the
   data from the teen driving study to help determine which driving
   performance parameters and situations should be used to provide
   feedback about unsafe driving performance to newly licensed teens.

   The 100-Car Naturalistic Driving data set was collected in 2003 and
   2004 and has been mined numerous times since. Databases from the
   100-Car study are available for public use on the Virginia Tech
   Transportation Institute website. [162]Several publications resulting
   from analysis of the data are reported by the National Highway Traffic
   Safety Administration.

   A premier [163]Research Institute of Virginia Tech, the [164]Virginia
   Tech Transportation Institute conducts applied research to save lives,
   protect the environment, and solve transportation challenges. Employing
   an elite team of multi-disciplinary researchers, engineers,
   statisticians, technicians, support staff, and students, the institute
   addresses transportation challenges from various perspectives: vehicle,
   driver, infrastructure, and environment. As the National Surface
   Transportation Safety Center for Excellence, the Virginia Tech
   Transportation Institute develops and tests advanced transportation
   safety devices, techniques, and innovative applications.
