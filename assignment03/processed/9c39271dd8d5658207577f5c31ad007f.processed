Fall museum preview: Photographs of the March on Washington and more

   [310][35503u1375388942.jpg]

   [311]View Photo Gallery -- Fall museum preview: National Gallery of
   Art, Library of Congress and more: Washington Project for the Arts'
   "Cyber in Securities," photos of the March on Washington, modern works
   and more are among the Post critics' must-see art this fall.

By [312]Lonnae O'Neal Parker, E-mail the writer

   With all the observances to mark the 50th anniversary of the nation's
   largest protest in the civil rights era, the Library of Congress chose
   a simple, singular focus for its photo exhibition, [313]"A Day Like No
   Other: Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington."

   "It's all about that day. It's about that feeling. We wanted to have
   visitors recall what it must have been like to arrive in Washington,
   D.C., on Aug. 28, 1963," said Maricia Battle, curator of photography.

   The one-room, three-part display is filled with intimate, subjective,
   and even esoteric angles that add up to a sense of immersion; dozens of
   lenses taking sensory impressions to telegraph to future generations
   what it was to have marched, and what it was to have looked around to
   see hundreds of thousands of your countrymen, bonded for the day in
   American ideals, marching alongside you.

   The show features 24 wall images, two display cases of eight
   photographs each and a slide presentation that loops through nearly 60
   images. It is the work of eight professional photographers (and one
   cartoonist), some of whom came to the march to work (for the UPI news
   agency and Look magazine), and others who came to take part and brought
   their cameras along.

   In many commemorations, the 1963 march plays out against the vastness
   of its frame -- against its protest signs and calls for full
   citizenship, against its stirring oratory, and against the deep racial
   divisions of the day. In this exhibition, the day plays across the
   faces and gestures of the people who were there. It shows up in how
   they dressed, the ways they clasped hands, huddled and hugged. It shows
   up in how they closed their eyes, or opened their mouths and belted out
   freedom songs.

   "It's about the photography for us," said the exhibition's co-curator,
   Verna Curtis. The photographers "were there, feeling it," and "it makes
   for a different way of looking" at the march.

   In the case of Leonard Freed, "it brings close-ups of individuals,"
   Curtis said, pointing out photos of black and white marchers joining
   hands in front of the Lincoln Memorial, small groups of men, young
   people, and a white priest with a young black man who is wearing a
   T-shirt with the words "Freedom Now" on the back. Freed photographed
   one couple, eyes closed, who seem to be humming. In another shot, they
   sing full force, and the image feels so alive you can almost hear the
   trill in their upper registers.

   The exhibition is laid out as if you were walking through the day. It
   begins with an early-morning shot by Flip Schulke of marchers with
   signs heading toward their gathering spot, with the Capitol dome in the
   background. There's a Bob Adelman photo of actor Ossie Davis holding a
   program outlining the schedule of events. People are moving from the
   Ellipse to the Washington Monument and then to the Lincoln Memorial,
   and a feeling of movement and multitude is conveyed as you walk through
   the exhibition room.

   Even though some of the photographers were commissioned, the wall
   photos are mostly images that were not used by media outlets. They are
   images the photographers chose to print independently of an editor's
   eye, culled from the hundreds they shot. One exception was a crowd
   photo taken over shoulder of Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial
   by UPI photographer Jim Atherton. His editor had asked for something
   unusual, and Atherton affixed his camera to the end of a bamboo pole,
   which he extended while standing on a ladder behind the statue.
