   Truth commissions become victims of their own success, cautions UN
   expert on transitional justice

   GENEVA (13 September 2013) - United Nations Special Rapporteur on
   transitional justice Pablo de Greiff today cautioned that truth
   commissions -a usual response in transitional situations- increasingly
   face a number of important challenges, and risk becoming victims of
   their own success.

   "The truth about atrocities must carry consequences," Mr. de Greiff
   told the UN Human Rights Council in his latest report*, "but the
   implementation of commissions' recommendations is severely lacking and
   therefore victims are left with partial, if any redress."
   The human rights expert underscored that truth commissions have made
   significant contributions to transitional processes, giving voice to
   victims of atrocities, backing the implementation of other transitional
   justice measures, and giving a meaning to the right to truth.

   However, he warned, they face various challenges which can lead to the
   non-implementation of recommendations. Among these challenges are
   overly broad mandates, flawed choices of commissioners, and
   insufficient and unreliable funding streams.

   The Special Rapporteur remarked that nowadays, truth commissions are
   supposed to juggle functions of fact-finding, victim-tracing and
   redress, provide comprehensive analysis of underlying causes, and
   generate comprehensive structural and institutional reform proposals.
   At times, they are even tasked with clarifying and resolving corruption
   cases, and with the monumental task of bringing about reconciliation.

   "As temporary bodies, with finite resources and competencies,
   commissions are simply not in a position to meet all of these
   expectations," the expert underlined. "On their own, they cannot be
   expected to assume such a broad array of functions and bring about a
   successful transition."

   "They are not and cannot be made responsible for the implementation of
   their own recommendations," Mr. de Greiff stressed. "This
   responsibility lies clearly with the States". In his view, "commissions
   need to be assigned adequate, targeted and feasible functions."

   The expert further highlighted that truth commissions derive their
   power, to a large extent, from the moral authority and the expertise of
   commissioners, and therefore recommended that States "prioritize
   expertise over partisan political affiliation and ethnic identities, as
   the latter will likely result in tracking prevailing political or
   social cleavages."

   "Selection procedures need to sufficiently vet commissioners for
   professionalism and integrity," the Special Rapporteur added, calling
   for the development of international standards.

   "In the end", he noted, "it should be remembered that insight is a
   precondition of, but not the same thing as, successful transformation.
   Revealing the truth is a critical part of processes leading to the
   establishment of regimes of rights. Acting upon such truth requires
   political determination, civil society participation, and financial
   resources".

   Special Rapporteur de Greiff also called on post-authoritarian and
   post-conflict States to pursue a comprehensive transitional justice
   approach and on the international community to support these countries
   in expeditious, reliable, and sustainable ways, throughout the work of
   a commission and after.

   Pablo de Greiff was appointed by the UN Human Rights Council as the
   first Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation
   and guarantees of non-recurrence in 2012. A human rights expert from
   Colombia, Pablo de Greiff has extensive professional and academic
   expertise on transitional justice issues. He has been the Director of
   Research at the International Center for Transitional Justice since
   2001. As a Special Rapporteur, he is independent from any government
   and serves in his individual capacity. For further information, log on
