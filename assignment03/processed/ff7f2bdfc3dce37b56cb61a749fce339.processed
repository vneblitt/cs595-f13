UN confirms chemical weapons used in Syria

   By Edith M. Lederer Associated Press September 16, 2013 11:58AM

   Updated: September 17, 2013 12:32AM

   UNITED NATIONS -- Careful not to blame either side for a deadly
   chemical weapon attack, U.N. inspectors reported Monday that rockets
   loaded with the nerve agent sarin had been fired from an area where
   Syria's military has bases, but said the evidence could have been
   manipulated in the rebel-controlled stricken neighborhoods.

   The U.S., Britain and France jumped on evidence in the report --
   especially the type of rockets, the composition of the sarin agent, and
   trajectory of the missiles -- to declare that President Bashar Assad's
   government was responsible.

   Russia, Syria's closest ally, called the investigators' findings
   "deeply disturbing," but said it was too early to draw conclusions. The
   Syrian government's claims that opposition forces were responsible for
   the attack "cannot be simply shrugged off," Russian Ambassador Vitaly
   Churkin insisted.

   The conclusions represented the first official confirmation by
   impartial scientific experts that chemical weapons were used in Syria's
   civil war, but the inspectors' limited mandate barred them from
   identifying who was responsible for the Aug. 21 attack.

   "This is a war crime," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the
   Security Council when he presented the report. "The results are
   overwhelming and indisputable. The facts speak for themselves."

   Ban called it "the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons
   against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them" in Halabja, Iran, in
   1988, and "the worst use of weapons of mass destruction in the 21st
   century."

   The deep division between Western backers of rebels seeking to
   overthrow Assad and Russian and Chinese supporters of the regime has
   paralyzed the U.N. Security Council since the Syrian conflict began 2
   1/2 years ago.

   Even though the United States and Russia agreed Saturday on the
   framework to put Syria's chemical weapons stockpile and precursors
   under international control for future destruction, their top diplomats
   were at odds Monday over a new Security Council resolution that would
   make the deal legally binding -- and whether there should be a
   reference to possible military enforcement if Syria doesn't comply.

   After months of negotiations, the U.N. inspectors went to Syria to
   visit the sites of three alleged chemical attacks earlier this year and
   were in the capital of Damascus on Aug. 21 when reports and videos
   began surfacing of a shelling attack in which victims experienced
   shortness of breath, disorientation, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting,
   weakness and a loss of consciousness.

   They finally gained access to three towns where the Aug. 21 attack
   occurred, and on one occasion their convoy was hit by sniper fire, but
   the inspectors were nonetheless able to collect a large amount of
   material and talk to survivors and witnesses.

   "The environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected
   provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets
   containing the nerve agent sarin were used ... in the Ghouta area of
   Damascus," their report said.

   "The conclusion is that chemical weapons have been used in the ongoing
   conflict between the parties in the Syrian Arab Republic, also against
   civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale," they said.
   "This result leaves us with the deepest concern."

   The rebels and their Western and Arab supporters have blamed Assad's
   regime for the attack in the rebel-controlled area of Ghouta. The
   Syrian government insists the attack was carried out by rebels. The
   U.N. report mentions the Ghouta areas of Ein Tarma, Moadamiyeh and
   Zamalka, all of which were featured in videos of victims that emerged
   after the attack.

   The U.N. report did not mention how many people were killed in the Aug.
   21 attack. The U.S. says more than 1,400, but other death toll
   estimates have been far lower.

   The report cited the following evidence to support its conclusions:

   -- Rockets and fragments were found to contain sarin. "Several
   surface-to-surface rockets capable of delivering significant chemical
   payloads were identified and recorded at the investigated sites," the
   investigators said.

   -- Close to the impact sites, in the area where people were affected,
   inspectors collected 30 soil and environmental samples -- far more than
   any previous U.N. investigation -- and in a majority of the samples,
   "the environment was found to be contaminated by sarin," its
   by-products, and "other relevant chemicals, such as stabilizers."

   -- Blood, urine and hair samples from 34 patients who had signs of
   poisoning by a chemical compound provided "definitive evidence of
   exposure to sarin by almost all of the survivors assessed."

   -- More than 50 interviews with survivors and health care workers
   "provided ample corroboration of the medical and scientific results."

   "The large-scale use of sarin, the direction of the rocket attacks, and
   kind of rockets used in the attacks all point to use by Assad's forces
   beyond reasonable doubt," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the
   Washington-based Arms Control Association.

   "The conclusions reached by the United States and European governments
   would now appear to have received corroboration by a source the
   Russians and Syrians will have trouble discrediting," Kimball said.

   The inspectors described the rockets used to disperse the sarin as a
   variant of an M14 artillery rocket, with either an original or an
   improvised warhead. The report said the rockets that hit two of the
   suburbs -- Zamalka and Ein Tarma -- were fired from the northwest, but
   it didn't say who launched them.

   The inspectors did not provide a location for the rockets' launch site,
   but Qassioun Mountain, where the Syrian military is known to have
   bases, is roughly northwest of both suburbs.

   "This was no cottage industry use of chemical weapons," Britain's U.N.
   Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said.

   "To put it in perspective, just on those rocket samples that they were
   able to examine, they had a payload of a total of 350 liters, which is
   35 times the amount that was used in the Tokyo subway" in 1995, he
   said, adding that the inspectors also confirmed "that the quality of
   the sarin was superior" both to that used in Tokyo and also to what was
   used by Iraq against Iran.

   U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power noted that chief inspector Ake Sellstrom
   said the weapons "were professionally made."

   "It defies logic that the opposition would have infiltrated the
   regime-controlled area to fire on opposition-controlled areas," she
   said. "Only the regime could have carried out this large-scale attack."

   But Churkin wondered why there were no reports of casualties among
   opposition fighters if government forces fired rockets filled with
   sarin to try to oust opposition groups from the area.

   "Is it theoretically possible to fire five or six rockets and miss your
   opponent?" he asked.

   The inspectors cautioned that the five sites they investigated had been
   "well- traveled by other individuals prior to the arrival of the
   mission."

   "During the time spent at these locations, individuals arrived carrying
   other suspected munitions indicating that such potential evidence is
   being moved and possibly manipulated," the report said. The areas were
   under rebel control, but the report did not elaborate on who the
   individuals were.

   In the report, Sellstrom said the team was issuing the findings on the
   Ghouta attacks "without prejudice" to its continuing investigation and
   final report on the alleged use of chemical weapons in three other
   areas. Ban said he expects the inspectors to return to Syria "as soon
   as possible" to complete their investigation.

   Under an Aug. 13 agreement between the U.N. and the Syrian government,
   Sellstrom's team was scheduled to investigate an alleged chemical
   weapons attack on March 19 on the village of Khan al Assal outside
   Aleppo and alleged attacks on two other sites that were kept secret for
   security reasons. The inspectors' report for the first time identified
   the two sites still to be investigated as Sheik Maqsood and Saraqueb.

   U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his French and British
   counterparts worked on a two-pronged approach to Syria: They called for
   enforceable U.N. benchmarks for eradicating the chemical weapons
   program and an international conference bolstering the moderate
   opposition.

   An agreement reached with the Russians calls for an inventory of
   Syria's chemical weapons program within one week, with all components
   of the program out of the country or destroyed by mid-2014.

   The next step must be a decision by the executive committee of the
   Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which implements
   the convention that Syria has agreed to join, to endorse the
   U.S.-Russian agreement. The OPCW is based in The Hague, Netherlands,
   and it isn't certain when it will meet, although several diplomats said
   probably later this week.

   Once the OPCW approves the agreement, the Security Council must adopt a
   resolution endorsing both the U.S.-Russian agreement and the OPCW
   decision.

   "This resolution needs to enshrine the OPCW decision in legally binding
   form, because the OPCW does not have the ability to impose legally
   binding obligations," Britain's Lyall Grant said.

   France and the U.S. insisted that a military response to the Aug. 21
   attack remained on the table, and were pressing for a U.N. resolution
   reflecting that.

   "It has to be strong, it has to be forceful, it has to be real, it has
   to be accountable, it has to be transparent, it has to be timely. All
   of those things are critical. And it has to be enforced," Kerry said.

   "We will not tolerate avoidance or anything less than full compliance
   by the Assad regime," he added.

   Kerry said the agreement "fully commits the United States and Russia to
   impose measures under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter in the event of
   non-compliance." Chapter 7 resolutions allow for military enforcement.

   Lavrov said Chapter 7 was the subject of "fierce debate" during the
   talks but stressed that "the final document ... doesn't mention it" and
   that the Security Council resolution being negotiated will not be under
   Chapter 7.

   He said if Syria fails to cooperate, the Security Council can pass an
   entirely different resolution "which may employ Chapter 7." Lavrov
   stressed that ongoing attempts to threaten the use of force against
   Syria would provoke the opposition and disrupt a chance for peace
   negotiations in Geneva that the U.S. and Russia have been trying to
   organize.

   The Syrian National Coalition -- the main umbrella opposition group --
   welcomed the inspectors' report and urged the Security Council to hold
   the Assad regime responsible for the Aug. 21 attack and refer the
   Syrian government to the International Criminal Court for prosecution.

   Gen. Salim Idris, head of the rebel Free Syrian Army, said in an
   interview on the PBS NewsHour that the inspectors' report makes "very
   clear that there's a war crime."

   He said the Syrian people "are very frustrated because of what's going
   on and because the international community is not caring anymore about
   the victims."

   Peter Spielmann at the United Nations, and Albert Aji in Damascus,
   Syria, contributed to this report.
