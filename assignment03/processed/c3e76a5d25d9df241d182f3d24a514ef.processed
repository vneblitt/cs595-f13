   NEW YORK -- "Sesame Street" wants kids to take a break from parking it
   indoors, and head out to a park instead.

   A new project has recruited Muppet monsters Elmo and Murray to visit
   national parks in six short videos that encourage children ages 3-5 to
   experience the great outdoors, wherever it might be, and to apply
   scientific skills of inquiry to learn about these natural settings.

   The product of a partnership between Sesame Workshop, the U.S. National
   Park Service and its philanthropic offshoot, the National Park
   Foundation, "Sesame Street Explores National Parks" aims to promote
   science learning by kids through their experiences in national parks as
   well as local parks and their own backyards.

   "This is very child-focused, stimulating children's natural curiosity
   and bringing that exploration to the natural environment," said
   Rosemarie T. Truglio, Sesame Workshop's senior vice president of
   education and research.

   Beginning Tuesday, the videos can be streamed on partner organizations'
   websites and social media channels, and will be made available to all
   national parks for use in their visitor centers, along with related
   materials for parents, caregivers and educators that propose activities
   to share with children.

   Each video features Elmo and Murray (in ranger regalia) as they meet
   with a park ranger from Grand Canyon National Park or Gateway National
   Recreation Area, which is located in New York City and northern New
   Jersey.

   In one video, the furry twosome are greeted by Ranger Shalini Gopie,
   who introduces them to the term "migrate."

   "Migrate!" Murray echoes proudly. "That's when you get a really bad
   headache!"

   He and Elmo soon learn otherwise from Gopie as she shows them migrating
   animals at Gateway such as tree swallows, redwing blackbirds and
   butterflies.

   "Children are natural scientists," said Truglio, "and we want to
   encourage them to get outside and to explore the world around them
   using all their senses - to explore and investigate and learn."

   While the videos portray a visit to a national park, they also aim to
   help kids make the connection between a national park and nature in
   their own neighborhood.

   "We have a concern that children are losing their connection to the
   outdoors," said National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis. "As you show
   kids the habitats at Gateway National Park and the Grand Canyon, you're
   showing them that there are similar habitats near them. We want to get
   these kids thinking, `Let's move, let's get outside, and learn
   something at the same time.'"

   The choice of the Grand Canyon as a setting may seem like a magnificent
   no-brainer, but there's a good reason, too, for spotlighting the
   less-familiar Gateway.

   "We have a very strong interest in emphasizing our urban national
   parks," said Jarvis, "because of their proximity to large populations."

   Beside those two, there are 399 more parks in the National Parks
   system, and Jarvis voiced hope that the Sesame Workshop project would
   be expanded to highlight more of them.

   "We would love to build a long-term relationship with `Sesame Street,'"
   he said.

   In the meantime, kids will be reminded by these initial videos that
   there are countless local parks, yards and lawns where nature is
   happening constantly, just waiting to be discovered.

   "Be like a ranger!" urges Murray, bringing it home. "Get outside and
   observe all the animals in their habitats."
