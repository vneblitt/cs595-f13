Looking for more ways to save energy?

     * Check out [40]Energy Saver for tips that save energy and money.

   At the beginning of every new year, millions of Americans make New
   Year's resolutions, which inevitably are forgotten by the end of
   January. This year, forget making a New Year's resolution. Instead make
   a home energy efficiency resolution.

   Need some ideas on resolutions to make your home more energy efficient?
   To get you started, I consulted with our experts in the [41]Building
   Technologies Program -- who work on developing innovative,
   cost-effective solutions to saving energy and money -- to create a list
   of the top ways to save energy and money at home. They came up with
   eight strategies all homeowners should adopt to lower their energy
   bills no matter the time of the year or their price range. Some tips
   are free or low cost and can be used daily to increase your energy
   savings, while others require a larger investment for long-term
   savings. This year, resolve to try one or more of these tips for
   improving your home's energy efficiency, and start seeing savings on
   your next energy bill.

   1. Install and set a programmable thermostat. You could save an
   estimated 10 percent per year on heating and cooling costs by using a
   [42]programmable thermostat, and by resetting your thermostat when you
   are asleep or away from home, you won't have to sacrifice comfort.

   2. Use sunlight to your advantage. The sun's rays can contribute
   heating in the winter but force air conditioners and fans to work
   harder -- and use more energy -- in the summer. During winter months,
   you can take advantage of sunlight by opening your curtains during the
   day to allow the sun to naturally heat your home. During warmer months,
   use light-colored [43]window shades or blinds to reflect heat back
   outside, keeping your home cooler and more efficient. Using [44]natural
   lighting effectively will also reduce the need to use artificial light.

   3. When replacing appliances or purchasing electronics, look for ENERGY
   STAR appliances, fans and electronics. Your home's [45]appliances and
   electronics account for close to 20 percent of your energy bills. Using
   ENERGY STAR® certified products -- which incorporate advanced
   technologies that use 10-15 percent less energy and water than standard
   models -- throughout your home could save nearly $900 over the lifetime
   of the products. For example, ENERGY STAR [46]clothes washers use about
   40 percent less energy than conventional clothes washers while reducing
   water bills. ENERGY STAR washers also require less detergent and are
   gentler on clothes, saving you money on clothing expenses.

   4. Choose energy-saving lighting. About 10 percent of the energy your
   home uses goes to [47]lighting costs. Replacing 15 traditional bulbs
   with energy-saving bulbs will save you $50 a year -- and more than $600
   in energy costs over the life of the bulbs. Compared to traditional
   incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent bulbs can yield as much as 75
   percent energy savings and last six-times longer. Get even more energy
   savings, longer life span and less wasted heat by switching to ENERGY
   STAR LEDs.

   5. Use an electronic power strip for your electronic equipment. Many
   electronic devices and equipment continue to consume unnecessary energy
   even when not in use. Often called energy vampires, these unplugged
   devices cost families about $100 a year. Use a [48]power strip for
   electronic devices and turn it off when not in use to eliminate these
   energy vampires. And be sure to unplug your chargers -- they draw
   energy even when they aren't connected to a device.

   6. Reduce energy for water heating. [49]Water heating is a large energy
   expense in your home, accounting for about 14 percent of your utility
   bills. By taking low-cost steps, you can reduce your water heating
   bills. Make sure your water heater is set to no higher than 120
   degrees. Install low-flow showerheads or temperature-sensitive shower
   valves. Newer water heaters have more insulation than older ones. If
   your water heater is more than five years old, you should wrap a water
   heater jacket around it to stop heat loss from the tank.

   7. Hire a professional to maintain your heating and cooling system.
   Arrange for [50]annual maintenance with a qualified technician. This
   includes checking the airflow over the coil, testing for the correct
   fluid (refrigerant) level, checking the combustion process and heat
   exchanger are operating safely, and ensuring proper air-flow to each
   room. In addition, you should clean the air filters in your heating and
   cooling system once a month, and replace them regularly.

   8. Consult a home performance contractor to achieve large savings.
   There is a growing industry of professionals who are qualified to make
   recommendations to homeowners on how to improve the overall energy
   efficiency of their homes. These [51]professional energy assessors will
   do a comprehensive energy audit of your whole house using special tools
   -- such as a blower door test and an infrared camera to locate air
   leaks -- to measure home energy efficiency.

   A professional energy audit gives you a thorough picture of where your
   home is losing energy and what you can do to save money. By making
   upgrades (especially sealing air leaks and properly insulating your
   home), you can expect to save 15-30 percent or more in energy costs,
   while also improving your home's comfort and air quality. Visit the
   [52]Home Performance with ENERGY STAR website to learn more about this
   approach and to locate home performance contractors near you.
