Are You Ready For Some Controversy? The History Of 'Redskin'

   by Lakshmi Gandhi
   September 09, 201310:46 AM

Correction Sept. 9, 2013

   A previous version of this story misidentified writer Ian Crouch as Ian
   Crouther.

   Clarification: We previously misstated Darrell Green's remarks to D.C.
   radio station WTOP, saying that Green had said the team should consider
   changing its name. The former Washington Redskins player actually told
   WTOP that the team should have a conversation about a name change.

   Monday Night Football kicks off this evening with the Washington
   Redskins facing off against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field. As
   the Redskins start a new season, they are once again in the center of a
   national debate about their name.

   On Thursday, the Oneida Indian Nation in upstate New York announced the
   launch of [24]a radio ad campaign urging the team to change its
   moniker. The ad begins with an Oneida leader commending NFL
   Commissioner Roger Goodell for condemning the behavior of Eagles player
   Riley Cooper, after Cooper was [25]recorded using the N-word at a
   concert this summer. While the narrator applauds the NFL for taking
   swift action in the Cooper case, he then draws a parallel between that
   slur and the word "redskin." "We do not deserve to be called redskins,"
   he says in the ad. "We deserve to be treated as what we are â
   Americans." The spots began airing in the D.C. market on Sunday. (You
   can listen [26]to it in full here.)

   The Oneida campaign is just the latest protest this year against the
   Redskins' name. The online magazine Slate made headlines last month
   when it [27]declared the site will no longer use "Redskins" to refer to
   the franchise, choosing instead to refer to "the Washington NFL team"
   from now on. Slate isn't alone: [28]The New Republic and [29]Mother
   Jones quickly followed suit. Major news sources like The Washington
   Post, The New York Times and The Associated Press, however, [30]will
   continue to refer to the team as the "Redskins" this season.

   But where did the word "redskin" come from? Many dictionaries and
   history books say the term came about in reference to the [31]Beothuk
   tribe of what is now Newfoundland, Canada. The Beothuk were said to
   paint their bodies with red ochre, leading white settlers to refer to
   them as "red men."

   According to [32]Smithsonian historian Ives Goddard, early historical
   records indicate that "Redskin" was used as a self-identifier by Native
   Americans to differentiate between the two races. Goddard found that
   the first use of the word "redskin" came in 1769, in negotiations
   between the Piankashaws and Col. John Wilkins. Throughout the 1800s,
   the word was [33]frequently used by Native Americans as they negotiated
   with the French and later the Americans. The phrase gained widespread
   usage among whites when James Fenimore Cooper used it [34]in his 1823
   novel The Pioneers. In the book, Cooper has a dying Indian character
   lament, "There will soon be no red-skin in the country."

   The Pioneers and other books by Cooper were largely seen as sympathetic
   toward Native Americans and their struggles in the 1800s. Decades
   later, the word "redskin" began to take on a negative, increasingly
   violent connotation. Author L. Frank Baum, best known for his classic
   The Wizard of Oz, celebrated the death of Sitting Bull and the massacre
   at Wounded Knee [35]with a pair of editorials calling for the
   extermination of all remaining Native Americans. In one of the December
   1890 pieces, Baum wrote, "With his fall the nobility of the Redskin is
   extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick
   the hand that smites them."

   At around the same time the word "redskin" was becoming a word with
   negative connotations, other Native American words and images were
   becoming increasingly popular symbols for sports teams. In [36]an
   article for the North Dakota Law Review, J. Gordon Hylton found that
   team owners frequently began using words with indigenous connections in
   the 1850s. "Native American names appear to have been chosen to
   emphasize the 'Americanness' of the team and its patriotic character,"
   writes Hylton, without noting that at the same time popular culture was
   relegating Native Americans to the foreign and the extreme.

   While Cooper's portrayal of Native Americans in books like The Pioneers
   was sympathetic, the portrayal of Indians created a backlash of sorts.
   In 1915, the poet Earl Emmons released [37]Redskin Rimes, a book so
   offensive I had to double-check to make sure it wasn't a parody of the
   racism of that era. Emmons makes his intentions clear in the
   introduction of the work: "Those persons who got their idea of the
   Indian from Mr. Cooper have pictured him as an injured innocent. ...
   Those persons have acquired the wrong idea of the maroon brother." That
   introduction kicks off a series of poems, songs and speeches, each more
   offensive than the last.

   Emmons' book was emblematic of the usage of the word "redskins" in the
   late 1800s and early 1900s, as the word went from being an identifying
   term to a derogatory slur. By the 1910s, it wasn't uncommon for
   filmgoers to encounter it, with the word frequently [38]popping up in
   the titles of American Westerns.

   The [39]hit film Redskin (1929) was notable for two reasons: first,
   that it was one of the first films to use Technicolor; and secondly,
   that the script was surprisingly sympathetic toward its main character,
   a Navajo Indian who is constantly harassed because of his race. The
   portrayal of Native Americans in Redskin was very much ahead of its
   time â other films that used the word portrayed the culture as
   primitive and war-hungry. The 1932 [40]Tom and Jerry cartoon "Redskin
   Blues" follows the beloved characters as they are attacked by Indians,
   surviving after they are rescued by the U.S. Army.

   Just a year after that stereotype-laden Tom and Jerry cartoon was
   released, Boston Braves owner George Preston Marshall decided in 1933
   to change the franchise's name from the Braves (another name with a
   racial history) to the Redskins. Team lore says the franchise adopted
   the name in honor of former coach William "Lone Star" Dietz, who
   identified as Native American. Dietz brought several Native American
   players he had coached at the [41]Haskell Indian School with him to the
   team. Marshall also sought to strongly tie the team to Native American
   imagery, occasionally requiring Dietz to wear a Sioux headdress on the
   sidelines and telling players to wear war paint while on the field.
   The cover of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat Sunday supplement from
   January 1908 shows William "Lone Star" Dietz, who in 1916 coached
   Washington State University to a Rose Bowl victory, in full Indian
   dress. Some credit Dietz with inspiring the name of the Redskins.

   Five years later, the team [44]unveiled its fight song, "Hail to the
   Redskins," with lyrics written by Marshall's wife, actress Corinne
   Griffith. The original lyrics to the song included both references to
   scalping and pidgin English, with the line "Scalp 'em, swamp 'em â we
   will take 'em big score / Read 'em, weep 'em, touchdown! â we want heap
   more!"

   The word began to fade from everyday usage in the 1960s (though songs
   like [45]the 1960 Richie Allen track "Redskin" would occasionally be
   released). As Ian Crouch [46]recently pointed out in The New Yorker,
   "since 1971, nearly two-thirds of professional and amateur athletic
   teams bearing Native American iconography have made a change."

   Recent months have seen several athletes and other sports figures speak
   out about the name, as well. In July, Redskins Hall of Famers Darrell
   Green and Art Monk [47]spoke with the D.C. radio station WTOP.

   "[If] Native Americans feel like Redskins or the Chiefs or [another]
   name is offensive to them, then who are we to say to them, 'No, it's
   not?' " Monk said. Green agreed, saying, "It deserves and warrants
   conversation because somebody is saying, 'Hey, this offends me,' and
   then you have a conversation."

   Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering the team is based in Washington,
   many elected officials have also weighed in. D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray
   [48]said earlier this year that the name has become "a lightning rod"
   and that the team would have to seriously consider changing the name if
   it wished to move from Maryland back into the District in the future.
   The mayor seems to also have a self-imposed ban on saying the name of
   the team, merely referring to it as "our football team" in [49]his 2013
   State of the District address. Members of Congress have also spoken out
   against the name, with a bipartisan group [50]sending a letter to the
   team urging a name change.

   And when the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian
   [51]hosted a symposium on Indian mascots in February, museum director
   Kevin Gover, himself a Native American, said the word was "the
   equivalent of the N-word." At the same event, former Colorado Sen. Ben
   Nighthorse Campbell asked the crowd to consider an equally offensive
   name for the local sports team: "How you would like for us to change
   the name of that team to the Washington Darkies?"

   For his part, Redskins owner Daniel Snyder has been vocal in his
   support for the name and has insisted that it's here to stay. "We'll
   never change the name," Snyder [52]told USA Today in May. "It's that
   simple. NEVER â you can use caps."

   Native American activist Suzan Shown Harjo has been battling the
   Redskins over the name for more than 20 years. "The name is one of the
   last vestiges of racism that is held right out in the open in America,"
   Harjo said in a recent phone conversation. "It's a toy of racism, and
   the people who are holding on [to the name] for dear life, they know
   that."

   But do they really? A [53]Washington Post poll from June revealed that
   8 out of 10 fans believe the team should keep its name. However, you
   shouldn't expect to hear those same fans use the word in nonfootball
   conversations. Over half of those questioned agreed that the word
   "redskin" is an inappropriate term to describe Native Americans.
