Piecing together Egypt's rupture

Brotherhood's downfall had roots in electoral success, analyst says

   By Alvin Powell, Harvard Staff Writer

   Egypt's unrest has its root, ironically, in democratic success: the
   Muslim Brotherhood's overwhelming ballot box victories, a [83]Harvard
   Kennedy School Middle East specialist said during a roundtable last
   week.

   In elections following the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime dictator
   Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood captured the president's
   office and a parliamentary majority. While those victories were bad
   news for Egyptian liberals and the remnants of the former regime, alone
   they weren't enough to prompt this summer's military action, according
   to [84]Tarek Masoud, associate professor of public policy.

   Instead, Masoud said, it was the prospect of continued electoral
   dominance by Brotherhood candidates at all levels that led to the move.

   "The Muslim Brotherhood was just too good at winning elections," Masoud
   said. "If the liberals actually thought they could win an election,
   they would have channeled [public dissatisfaction] into the next
   election. ... The opposition was not confident it could beat the
   Brotherhood in an election, so it needed the military."

   In July, after massive anti-government protests, the Egyptian military
   suspended the constitution and removed President Mohamed Morsi from
   office, sending Brotherhood leaders into hiding and the group's
   supporters into the streets in protest. More than 1,000 have been
   killed.

   On Sept. 5, a conference room and nearby hallways at the [85]Center for
   Middle Eastern Studies were packed for a discussion that in addition to
   Masoud included [86]E. Roger Owen, the A.J. Meyer Professor of Middle
   East History Emeritus, and grad student Sarah Moawad, who recently
   returned to campus after spending several weeks in Egypt.

   Moawad shared observations of the anti-government protests in Cairo and
   Alexandria and said dissatisfaction with Morsi's government had been
   widespread in the weeks before he was removed from office, with long
   gas lines, irregular electricity supplies, falling tourist dollars, and
   overall economic decline key factors. In addition, the predominately
   Muslim Egyptian people were tired of the Brotherhood telling them how
   to be Muslim, Moawad said.

   People she spoke with were upset at the characterizations, mostly in
   the Western press, of the military takeover as a coup, as they
   preferred to think of it as an action supported by signatures from some
   22 million voicing a withdrawal of confidence in the Muslim Brotherhood
   government.

   "The Muslim Brotherhood was remarkably effective at alienating the
   people who were willing to give them a chance," Moawad said.

   The military was never removed from its lofty position atop Egyptian
   society, Masoud said, despite claims to the contrary. The Brotherhood,
   in fact, went to great lengths to assure the military that they weren't
   at odds, he said.

   Those who view the takeover as a response to the imposition of
   religious government on what had been a secular state are missing how
   conservative most of Egyptian society is on religious matters, Masoud
   said. For most Egyptians, the religious aspects of Brotherhood rule
   were not a big problem. He also disagreed with those who saw it as an
   expression of dissatisfaction over very real economic difficulties.

   The Brotherhood's role in Egyptian politics is at an end, since the
   military is vigorously pursuing the group's members, Masoud predicted.
   That doesn't mean, however, that there is no role for an Islamist party
   in the country's future, he said.

   "I do think political Islam has to be accommodated and allowed to
   participate in Egypt's future," Masoud said.

   Participants expressed uncertainty over what that future might hold.
   Though some may be tempted to think that recent events represent a
   return to the authoritarian governments of the past, Owen rejected that
   view. Instead, he said, what we're seeing is another stage in ongoing
   changes that began with the Arab Spring of two years ago.

   "This process is not over, by any means."
