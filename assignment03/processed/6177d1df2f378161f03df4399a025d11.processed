What is peacekeeping?

   United Nations Peacekeeping helps countries torn by conflict create
   conditions for lasting peace.
   [EMBED]

   Actor George Clooney speaks of UN Peacekeepers.

   Peacekeeping has proven to be one of the most [53]effective tools
   available to the UN to assist host countries navigate the difficult
   path from conflict to peace.

   Peacekeeping has unique strengths, including legitimacy, burden
   sharing, and an ability to deploy and sustain troops and police from
   around the globe, integrating them with civilian peacekeepers to
   advance multidimensional mandates.

   UN Peacekeepers provide security and the political and peacebuilding
   support to help countries make the difficult, early transition from
   conflict to peace.

   UN Peacekeeping is guided by three basic principles:
     * Consent of the parties;
     * Impartiality;
     * Non-use of force except in self-defence and defence of the mandate.

   Peacekeeping is flexible and over the past two decades has been
   deployed in many configurations. There are currently [54]16 UN peace
   operations deployed on four continents.

   Today's multidimensional peacekeeping operations are called upon not
   only to maintain peace and security, but also to facilitate the
   political process, [55]protect civilians, assist in the
   [56]disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants;
   support the organization of elections, protect and promote human rights
   and assist in restoring the [57]rule of law.

   Success is never guaranteed, because UN Peacekeeping almost by
   definition goes to the most physically and politically difficult
   environments. However, we have built up a demonstrable record of
   success over our 60 years of existence, including winning the [58]Nobel
   Peace Prize.
     * [59]Peace and security

Peace and security
       Peacekeeping is one among a range of activities undertaken by the
       UN to maintain international peace and security.
     * [60]History of peacekeeping

History of peacekeeping
       The UN pioneered peacekeeping in 1948 with the establishment of the
       UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) in the Middle East. There
       have been 68 peacekeeping operations worldwide since then.
     * [61]Reform of peacekeeping

Reform of peacekeeping
       Peacekeeping continues to adapt to new challenges and political
       realities. Faced with an increasing demand for complex peace
       operations, we are working toward a comprehensive peacekeeping
       reform.
     * [62]Role of the General Assembly

Role of the General Assembly
       The General Assembly plays a key role in the financing of
       peacekeeping.
     * [63]Role of the Security Council

Role of the Security Council
       The Security Council has primary responsibility, under the UN
       Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security.
     * [64]Forming a new operation

Forming a new operation
       A number of steps have to happen before the deployment of a new UN
       Peacekeeping operation.
     * [65]Peacekeepers Day

Peacekeepers Day
       29 May is the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers.
