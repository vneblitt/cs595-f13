   One of the welcoming schools that took in students after Chicago Public
   Schools closed a record number of schools has been hustling students
   and staff out the door at the end of the day in response to recent gun
   violence nearby.

   Dulles School of Excellence, 6311 S. Calumet Ave., has told staffers in
   a memo and in announcements to clear the building and parking lot
   immediately after school is dismissed at 3:30 p.m. Teachers were told
   to exit with their students and leave the school.

   "For safety reasons, PLEASE ADHERE TO THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES" reads
   one memo handed out on Sept. 6. "Inthe event that students are not
   picked up at 3:30, please bring the child and current phone number to
   the office. Staff members will not be permitted back into the building
   except to bring late students to office for phone calls."

   On Friday morning, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is expected to cut the
   ribbon on the school's new playground and turf field. The improvements
   were received as one of about 50 CPS schools that took in children from
   47 elementary schools and a high school program that closed in June.

   Dulles also has a Safe Passage program -- designated paths for children
   to follow to school. Before and after school, police officers and
   yellow-vested community workers line the Safe Passage route.

   Deirdre Campbell, a spokeswoman for the Academy for Urban School
   Leadership, which has run the school since 2009, when CPS fired the
   staff and turned the school over to the academy, said the new procedure
   started Sept. 6 and has continued since.

   After a recent murder, "the school started dismissing children at the
   normal bell schedule, but was really enforcing quick and efficient
   dismissal," Campbell said.

   Campbell said Dulles' principal, Kesa Thurman, coordinated with Safe
   Passage workers to make sure arrivals and dismissals were covered.
   Thurman did not respond to a message seeking comment.

   Dulles staffers said they've been notified each day over the
   loudspeaker about the secure dismissals. And afternoon football
   practice has been canceled pending further notice, Campbell said.

   "My hope is this is a temporary situation and we continue to offer all
   of the things Dulles offers going forward," she said.

   CPS released a statement that said Safe Passage workers "are working
   closely with Principal Thurman every day to ensure that all children
   have safe routes as they walk to and from school so they can remain
   focused on their studies instead of their safety," spokeswoman Becky
   Carroll said in an email.

   In an emailed statement Thursday night, Chicago Police News Affairs
   director Adam Collins said: "There have been two shootings in the
   general Parkway Gardens area over the past few weeks. Neither took
   place during school hours or near arrival and dismissal times. CPD has
   an added presence in the area to ensure the safety of all children and
   the community."

   Chicago Police have been monitoring the possibility of a retaliatory
   shooting after the Aug. 27 murder of 17-year-old Pierce Curry in the
   6200 block of South State. He was in the back seat of a vehicle at 1:30
   a.m. when another car pulled up and someone opened fire, striking Curry
   in the head, police said.

   Factions of the Black Disciples and the Gangster Disciples have long
   been in conflict near the Parkway Gardens apartments just south of the
   school, police said.

   The area around 63rd and King, at the east end of the school, has seen
   other recent shootings. On Sept. 2 at 2:37 p.m., a 47-year-old man was
   shot twice in the abdomen at 63rd and Martin Luther King Drive, police
   said. The victim, who was standing in front of a currency exchange, ran
   to a McDonald's for safety. A gunman shot at a 2006 Ford Taurus in that
   incident, but no one in the car was wounded. No one was in custody as
   of Thursday, and police didn't know a motive for the shooting.

   Fabian Heard, father of four Dulles students ages 6 through 13, who
   live two blocks from the school, has been leaving work early to pick up
   his kids to take them home.

   "Now they rush a lot of the kids out of here because there's been
   shootings in both directions," Heard said from the driver's seat of his
   tan sedan at 3:30 sharp Thursday. "There's more of a haste to do it,
   and now I understand it's because of the violence. They shoot right
   here on King Drive."

   His eldest son, Demetrius Bailey, is one of the football players who's
   missing afternoon practice. He said school officials have been telling
   kids, "Go straight home, no playing around."

   "They don't want anybody to get hurt," Demetrius said.

   Heard said he will continue to pick up his kids every afternoon. "Right
   now is when all the knuckleheads come out."
