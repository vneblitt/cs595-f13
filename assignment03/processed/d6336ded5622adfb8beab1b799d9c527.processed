   BLACKSBURG, Va., Jan. 24, 2013 - [160]Virginia Tech Dining Services has
   partnered with the [161]Department of Dairy Science to offer "Virginia
   Tech Milk" in D2 at Dietrick Hall. Whole milk, skim milk, and 1 percent
   chocolate milk will all be offered.

   Students will harvest the milk on campus from the herd of dairy cows at
   Virginia Tech's Dairy Center. The milk will then be pasteurized by the
   James River Department of Agribusiness and served through the milk
   dispensers at D2 beginning Tuesday, Jan. 22 -- the first day of the
   spring semester.

   This project marks another positive step for Dining Services'
   sustainability initiatives. Ted Faulkner, director of Dining Services,
   said the move towards more sustainable practices was largely influenced
   by feedback from students.

   "Students frequently request more locally sourced food," Faulkner said.
   "This partnership is just another way Dining Services is listening to
   the student voice."

   Dining centers have been using meats purchased from the [162]College of
   Agriculture and Life Sciences's [163]Meat Science Center for over two
   years, and the university's [164]Kentland Farm provides local produce
   through the [165]Dining Services Garden at Kentland Farm.

   "We are fortunate to have so many resources available to us as a
   land-grant university," said Dining Services Sustainability Coordinator
   Rial Tombes. "We've fostered great partnerships with the Meat Science
   Center for meats sourced from campus, with Kentland Farm to source
   produce grown just off campus, and now with Dairy Science to supply
   milk from our own cows."

   The on-campus Dairy Center houses a teaching and research free-stall
   barn with a milking parlor.

   "This will be the highest quality milk served on campus," said Shane
   Brannock, the dairy farm superintendent. The milk produced and
   harvested at the dairy consistently surpasses Department of Agriculture
   standards. Though milk is always tested once it reaches the processing
   facility, Virginia Tech's dairy also tests its milk before shipping for
   quality assurance and research purposes.

   The Dairy Center has a longstanding relationship with the James River
   Department of Agribusiness, a Virginia Department of Corrections
   facility where offenders work with officers and staff to complete jobs.
   Through the processing, pasteurization, and distribution work they
   complete to sell milk from Virginia Tech's dairy, the offenders gain
   valuable work experience that helps them obtain employment once
   released.

   For several years, milk has been harvested at Virginia Tech, sent to
   James River Department of Corrections facilities for processing, and
   sold to various agencies. With Virginia Tech's sustainability efforts
   on the rise, Dining Services and Dairy Science began working together
   to serve the milk on campus.

   "The students, campus community, Dining Services, and animal science
   have all benefited from these partnerships," said Brannock. "It's high
   time for us all to benefit from a partnership with Dairy Science."

   Similar to the Meat Science Center and Kentland Farms, the Dairy Center
   supports the university's focus on teaching, extension, and research.
   Dairy science classes meet at the dairy for at least one lab each week,
   and 10 to 15 students work in the dairy each semester. These students
   work directly in the milking parlor, harvesting milk and feeding the
   herd.

   "Working at Virginia Tech's dairy allowed me to apply and relate what I
   was learning in the classroom to actual animals and the milking
   process," said Katie Rubilotta of Westminster, Ma., a sophomore
   majoring in dairy science and animal and poultry science in the College
   of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Rubilotta is looking forward to
   seeing the milk she helps harvest served on campus. "Many aren't even
   aware that Virginia Tech has a dairy. I hope that it may educate
   students and perhaps even spark their interest as to where and how
   their food is harvested," Rubilotta added.

   Brannock welcomes tours of the dairy facilities. Dining Services and
   the Dairy Center will host three tours of the dairy between the
   beginning of the semester and March. Those interested may visit the
   [166]Farms and Fields Project Blog for dates and to register for a
   tour.

   Dedicated to its motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), [167]Virginia
   Tech takes a hands-on, engaging approach to education, preparing
   scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the
   commonwealth's most comprehensive university and its leading research
   institution, Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree
   programs to more than 30,000 students and manages a research portfolio
   of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of
   transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and
   by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and
   across Virginia.
