Dodging antibiotic side effects

   Date: Jul 3, 2013

   New insights into how antibiotics damage human cells suggest novel
   strategies for making long-term antibiotic use safer
   image

     Antibiotics cause oxidative stress in cells, which leads to cellular
     damage. For example, in healthy cells (left), mitochondria, which
     are labeled yellow here, are long and highly branched. But in cells
     treated with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (right), mitochondria are
     abnormally short and unbranched, and they do not function as well.

   A team of scientists at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired
   Engineering at Harvard University has discovered why long-term
   treatment with many common antibiotics can cause harmful side effects
   -- and they have uncovered two easy strategies that could help prevent
   these dangerous responses. They reported the results in the July 3rd
   issue of Science Translational Medicine.

   "Clinical levels of antibiotics can cause oxidative stress that can
   lead to damage to DNA, proteins and lipids in human cells, but this
   effect can be alleviated by antioxidants," said Jim Collins, Ph.D., who
   led the study. Collins, a pioneer of synthetic biology and Core Faculty
   member at the Wyss Institute, is also the William F. Warren
   Distinguished Professor at Boston University, where he leads the Center
   of Synthetic Biology.

   Doctors often prescribe antibiotics freely, thinking that they harm
   bacteria while leaving human tissue unscathed. But over the years
   reports have piled up about the occasional side effects of various
   antibiotics, including tendonitis, inner-ear problems and hearing loss,
   diarrhea, impaired kidney function, and other problems.

   Collins suspected these side effects occurred when antibiotics
   triggered oxidative stress -- a condition in which cells produce
   chemically reactive oxygen molecules that damage the bacteria's DNA and
   enzymes, as well as the membrane that encloses the cell.

   Collins' team had already discovered that antibiotics that kill
   bacteria do so by triggering oxidative stress in the bacteria. They
   wondered whether antibiotics caused side effects by triggering
   oxidative stress in the mitochondria, a bacterium-like organelle that
   supplies human cells with energy.

   Sameer Kalghatgi, Ph.D., a former postdoctoral fellow in Collins'
   laboratory who is now Senior Plasma Scientist at EP Technologies in
   Akron, Ohio, and Catherine S. Spina, a M.D./Ph.D. candidate at Boston
   University and researcher at the Wyss Institute, first tested whether
   clinical levels of three antibiotics -- ciprofloxacin, ampicillin,
   kanamycin -- each cause oxidative stress in cultured human cells. They
   found that all of these drugs were safe after six hours of treatment,
   but longer-term treatment of about four days caused the mitochondria to
   malfunction.

   Kalghatgi and Spina then did a series of biochemical tests, which
   showed that the same three antibiotics damaged the DNA, proteins and
   lipids of cultured human cells -- exactly what one would expect from
   oxidative stress.

   The results mean that "doctors should only prescribe antibiotics when
   they're called for, and patients should only ask for antibiotics when
   they have a serious bacterial infection," Collins said.

   The team also treated mice with the same three antibiotics in
   mouse-sized doses similar to what patients receive in the clinic.
   Long-term treatment with each of the three antibiotics damaged the
   animal's lipids and caused levels of glutathione, one of the body's
   natural antioxidants, to fall -- another sign of oxidative stress.

   To make a difference in the clinic, however, the scientists still
   needed a way to prevent antibiotic-induced oxidative stress -- or a way
   to remediate it as it was occurring. They found both. They were able to
   prevent oxidative stress by using a bacteriostatic antibiotic -- an
   antibiotic such as tetracycline that stops bacteria from multiplying
   but does not kill them. They could also ease oxidative stress by
   mopping up chemically reactive oxygen molecules with an FDA-approved
   antioxidant called N-acetylcysteine, or NAC, that's already used to
   help treat children with cystic fibrosis.

   The new results come on the heels of two other recent breakthroughs on
   antibiotic treatment from Collins' group -- a report in Nature showing
   that viruses in the gut that infect bacteria harbor genes that confer
   antibiotic resistance, and another report in Science Translational
   Medicine showing that silver can boost the effectiveness of many widely
   used antibiotics.

   "Jim and his team are moving at lightning speed toward unlocking the
   medical mysteries that stand in the way of safe and effective
   antibiotic treatment," said Don Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., Wyss Institute
   Founding Director. "Doctors have known for years that antibiotics
   occasionally cause serious side effects, and Jim's new findings offer
   not one but two exciting new strategies that could address this
   long-neglected public health problem."

   Next, Collins plans more animal studies to work out the best ways to
   remediate oxidative stress. But since both bacteriostatic antibiotics
   and NAC are already FDA-approved, doctors might be using this strategy
   soon.

   "We're interested in seeing if this could be moved toward the clinic,"
   Collins said.

   This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health Director's
   Pioneer Award Program, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the
   Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard
   University. In addition to Collins, Kalghatgi, and Spina, the research
   team included James C. Costello, Ph.D., a former postdoctoral fellow on
   Collins' team who's now an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical
   School; Ruben Morones-Ramirez, Ph.D., a former postdoctoral fellow on
   Collins' team who is now a professor at Universidad Autònoma de Nuevo
   Leon in Mexico; Shimyn Slomovic, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow on
   Collins' team; Anthony Molina, Ph.D., Assistant Professor at Wake
   Forest School of Medicine; Orian Shirihai, Ph.D., Associate Professor
   at Boston University School of Medicine, and Marc Liesa, Ph.D., a
   research associate on Shirihai's team at Boston University School of
   Medicine.

   University (http://wyss.harvard.edu) uses Nature's design principles to
   develop bioinspired materials and devices that will transform medicine
   and create a more sustainable world. Working as an alliance among
   Harvard's Schools of Medicine, Engineering, and Arts & Sciences, and in
   partnership with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and
   Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer
   Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, the University of
   Massachusetts Medical School, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Boston
   University and Tufts University, the Institute crosses disciplinary and
   institutional barriers to engage in high-risk research that leads to
   transformative technological breakthroughs. By emulating Nature's
   principles, Wyss researchers are developing innovative new engineering
   solutions for healthcare, energy, architecture, robotics, and
   manufacturing. These technologies are translated into commercial
   products and therapies through collaborations with clinical
   investigators, corporate alliances, and new start-ups. The Wyss
   Institute recently won the prestigious World Technology Network award
   for innovation in biotechnology.
