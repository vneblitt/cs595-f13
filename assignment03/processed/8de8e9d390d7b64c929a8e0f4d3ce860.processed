   Staff report

   6:04 p.m. CDT, September 12, 2013

   A day after she was found in her Evanston home, the manner and cause of
   Sharon Eckersall's death remain a mystery.

   Eckersall, who served three terms as Evanston Township assessor and had
   been elected to return to the office in January, was pronounced dead
   after she was found unresponsive in her bed Wednesday morning,
   officials said. She was 69.

   The Cook County Medical Examiner's office conducted an autopsy Thursday
   but was unable to determine a cause or manner of death. Such a
   determination was "pending further studies," according to medical
   examiner records.

   Neither Evanston police nor an official from the medical examiner's
   office could be reached. In a highly unusual move, the medical
   examiner's office refused to disclose any information about Eckersall's
   death to the media, including confirmation of where and when she died.

   Eckersall, a longtime local real estate agent, ran unopposed this
   spring for the township assessor job she held until 2009 but was not
   due to be sworn in until next year. She was also the Republican nominee
   for Cook County assessor in 2010, losing to Democrat Joe Berrios.
