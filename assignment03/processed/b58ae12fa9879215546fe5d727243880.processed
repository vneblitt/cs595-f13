[78]Who will run Illinois torture inquiry commission?

   From left: John Mathias, Marcie Thorp, Gov. Pat Quinn

   When the Illinois Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission meets
   Wednesday, the question of who will be executive director will be at
   the top of the agenda. David Thomas now holds the job, but Gov. Pat
   Quinn has called for him to step down because, in three cases handled
   by the commission, relatives of crime victims

[85]Why Chicago didn't get buckled into Rust Belt, but still might

   From left: Edward "Ted" McClelland, Larry Bennett, Edward E. Gordon

   Chicago has prospered as a regional capital even as other Midwest
   cities have struggled in recent decades, but now must surmount new
   challenges or it will decline as well, three authors said Thursday at a
   Society of Midland Authors program at the Harold Washington Library
   Center in Chicago. "In a way, Chicago is a victor

   "The world's largest film camera" was unveiled Wednesday evening on the
   plaza east of the old Chicago Daily News building. It will be on
   display through Oct. 31 at 2 North Riverside Plaza. The camera can

[102]Is Stony Island the right honor for Bishop Brazier?

   Mayor Rahm Emanuel is undoubtedly trying to score points with black
   Chicagoans. Hard to imagine that isn't the case. Is it still a good
   idea to honor Bishop Arthur Brazier, a civil rights and spiritual
   leader, community activist and overall force for good in a world that
   doesn't have enough of them? Yes. Emanuel this

[109]A little-known piece of 1930s Chicago history

   Fritz Kuhn gets congratulations from fellow officers of the
   German-American Bund on his unanimous re-election in 1939 as national
   leader of the bund, which was holding its sixth national convention in
   Chicago. (Sun-Times Library)

   Chicago had its own surprising connection to the story of 1930s Nazis
   in America, according to a new book by Arnie Bernstein, "Swastika
   Nation: Fritz Kuhn and the Rise and Fall of the German-American Bund"
   (St. Martin's Press, Sept. 3). In 1938, Bund leader Fritz Kuhn claimed
   to have 4,000 to 6,000 Illinois followers in

[116]5 ways to spend $669,608 that are way better than new doors for the IL
Capitol building

   Surely Illinois' lawmakers could find a better way to spend $669,608
   than on six doors. Here are a few suggestions.

[122]Stop using the word "trolling" when what you really mean is "hate
speech"

   SUMMER TROLLING

   I take umbrage with the over-reliance of the word âtroll.â By grouping
   the rude with the hateful, we undermine the seriousness of bigotry and
   hate speech.

[128]`Honest' patronage? For Abe, answer was yes

   From left: Abraham Lincoln, Bill Daley, Pat Quinn

   Democratic gubernatorial candidates Bill Daley and incumbent Pat Quinn
   earlier this month exchanged barbs over who is a bigger beneficiary of
   patronage. Republican candidates jumped in with their own criticisms of
   political hiring. That exchange might have come as a surprise to
   Illinois' most revered politician, Abraham Lincoln. According to David
   Von Drehle's 2012 biography

[136]Government drones can't snoop on us under new law

   This undated file photo provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection
   shows an unmanned drone used to patrol the U.S.-Canadian border. (AP
   Photo/U.S. Customs and Border Protection)

   A new law thatÂ prohibits police from using drones without a warrant to
   track citizens was signed today by Gov. Pat Quinn. People are familiar
   with the larger drones that patrol our borders or war zones. But some
   of the unmanned aerial vehicles are so small they can fly around
   unnoticed, carrying high-power zoom lenses and

[144]Chaotic opening at welcoming school in Austin

   Hundreds of parents and students wait to get into Ellington School on
   opening day

   The scene was all chaos Monday morning outside Ellington Elementary, a
   top-tier school in Austin that absorbed students from two schools that
   closed this summer. A few hundred frustrated parents and students
   milled around a plaza outside Ellington for more than an hour as
   teachers slowly read class lists, trying to usher in students, often
