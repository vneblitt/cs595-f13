          The Take

For Hillary Clinton, past presents both pride and peril as she weighs 2016
presidential bid

   [295][Liberty_Medal-0a453-8689.jpg]

   [296]View Photo Gallery -- Hillary Rodham Clinton away from the
   microphones: A look at Hillary Rodham Clinton in relaxed moments during
   her tenures as secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady.

By [297]Dan Balz, E-mail the writer

   Two worlds of Hillary Rodham Clinton intersected this past week.
   Together they underscored not only why the former secretary of state is
   seen as perhaps the dominant unelected politician in the country today
   but also the concerns among some of her Democratic supporters as she
   considers a return to the political arena in 2016.

   As President Obama and Clinton's successor at State, John F. Kerry --
   during a dizzying week of diplomacy and threats of military action --
   grappled with how best to respond to Syria's alleged use of chemical
   weapons, Clinton was enjoying a fresh round of accolades and honors.
   The contrast between her recent past life and her current life was
   striking.

   On Tuesday, on a sultry summer evening, she was in Philadelphia, where
   she received the Liberty Medal during a ceremony at the National
   Constitution Center. On Friday, she was in Scotland, where she received
   an honorary degree from St. Andrews University, which was marking its
   600th anniversary with all appropriate academic pomp.

   Tuesday's ceremony in Philadelphia concluded an hour before Obama
   addressed the nation on the Syrian issue. On Friday, Clinton spoke in
   Scotland as Kerry was in Switzerland negotiating with his Russian
   counterpart on eliminating Syria's chemical weapons stocks.

   As both a former secretary of state and the prospective favorite for
   the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, Clinton enjoys the freedom
   to operate in an almost idealized world. She is still in the public eye
   but mostly not in the line of fire. For now, the hard decisions are
   someone else's responsibility.

   Circuit of accolades

   This fall, Clinton will maintain this circuit, receiving awards from
   civic and other organizations while delivering paid speeches to private
   audiences along the way. She is already a draw on the strength of her
   impressive résumé and her achievements during decades in public
   service. That she might also become president makes her all the more
   irresistible to organizations looking for someone to honor.

   Clinton may be a year or more from a formal decision about running, but
   among those who are turning out to hear her, there already is an
   assumption that she will be a candidate, if not a winning candidate. It
   is never far below the surface when she appears and is sometimes
   explicitly stated.

   In Philadelphia, Amy Guttman, president of the University of
   Pennsylvania, told the audience, "A few decades ago, when I was a
   child, it would have been unthinkable for a woman to be president of
   the University of Pennsylvania, let alone secretary of state of the
   United States, and something many of us can't wait to celebrate -- the
   first woman president of the United States."

   The Philadelphia ceremony included elements that might have been
   scripted for the 2016 Democratic convention, with a highlight reel of
   Clinton's life and video tributes from people such as former British
   prime minister Tony Blair and tennis star and women's rights advocate
   Billie Jean King. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R), who serves as
   chairman of the National Constitution Center, gave a warm introduction
   that included teasing references to possible competition with her in
   2016.
