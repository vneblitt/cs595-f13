   [20]UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Goodwill Ambassador, Yann
   Arthus-Bertrand, photographer, filmmaker, and philanthropist, screened
   his film, Planet Ocean to the United Nations community on Wednesday.

   [21]UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened the event and made
   introductory remarks at the filmâs New York debut.

   Co-directed by Michael Pitiot, narrated by Josh Duhamel, Planet Ocean
   features dazzling aerial and underwater imagery to deliver a
   far-reaching assessment of the political and environmental challenges
   facing our oceans, including over-fishing, pollution and climate
   change.

   The film has been financed by OMEGA. The firm has long been associated
   with the planetâs oceans and understands the dangers facing them, as
   well as the importance of their preservation. The [22]partnership
   between OMEGA and Planet Ocean was created in the spirit of its support
   for late friend and brand ambassador Sir Peter Blake and its
   decades-long sport of oceanic health and exploration.
