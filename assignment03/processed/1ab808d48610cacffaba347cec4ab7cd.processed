   Dr. Cyril R. Clarke Dr. Cyril R. Clarke

   BLACKSBURG, Va., July 18, 2013 - Dr. Cyril R. Clarke, of Corvallis,
   Ore., has been named dean of the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of
   Veterinary Medicine at Virginia Tech, effective Oct. 1.

   Clarke currently serves as professor and dean of Oregon State
   University's College of Veterinary Medicine. He will succeed Gerhardt
   G. Schurig, who announced his [160]plans to return to the faculty after
   10 years as both interim dean and dean of the veterinary college.

   Virginia Tech's senior vice president and provost, Mark McNamee,
   announced Clarke's appointment earlier today.

   "Cyril Clarke is a highly respected leader in veterinary medicine and
   education, bringing with him dean level experience and an impressive
   record of leadership and scholarly results. He brings perspective and
   experience that will serve the college, Virginia Tech, and the
   University of Maryland," said McNamee. "He emerged as the leading
   candidate among an exceptional pool of veterinary college and school
   leaders, and is joining a passionate and accomplished team of
   administrators, faculty, staff, and students. I look forward to working
   with him to further enhance the strategic goals of the college."

   Clarke, a native of Johannesburg, South Africa, will serve as the
   fourth dean of the [161]Virginia-Maryland Regional College of
   Veterinary Medicine.

   He said of his new position, "The college has established a
   distinguished record of accomplishment in veterinary education,
   delivery of clinical and diagnostic services across a wide range of
   clinical specialties, and biomedical research in comparative health
   sciences. It is particularly well positioned to advance translational
   medicine and the concept of One Health, which recognizes the close
   linkage between animal and public health. The partnership involving two
   land-grant universities provides an excellent opportunity for further
   development of innovative and collaborative programs that meet the
   veterinary educational and animal health needs of Virginia and
   Maryland. I am excited to be given the opportunity to lead the college
   in its next phase of development."

   The Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine has seen
   significant growth in recent years with a new Infectious Disease
   Research Facility and Veterinary Medicine Instruction Addition. Plans
   are underway for a new Translational Medicine Building, which will
   provide for expansion of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, as well as
   research labs and training spaces for interdisciplinary research.

   Student interest is high with a strengthened curriculum and unique
   tracking system that sets the college apart from other colleges of
   veterinary medicine. Last fall, a record-breaking 1,220 prospective
   students submitted applications to the college, representing the fourth
   largest applicant pool in North America.

   Clarke's efforts at Oregon State contributed to significant growth and
   enhancement of College of Veterinary Medicine programs, including the
   strengthening of clinical programs and student experiences. He was
   instrumental in the collaborative creation of the university's new
   division of health sciences, building relationships, and leveraging
   scholarship and research opportunities across several colleges and
   departments working in health and life sciences fields. He achieved
   positive results in fundraising, grew the research infrastructure, and
   developed significant relationships with international institutions
   working with veterinary clinical and research efforts.

   A diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Clinical
   Pharmacology, Clarke was a faculty member at Oklahoma State University
   from 1987 to 2007, where he also served as a department head and
   associate dean for academic affairs in the College of Veterinary
   Medicine. In 2007, he assumed the position of Lois Bates Acheson Dean
   of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Oregon State University. He
   also serves as a professor of pharmacology in the college's Department
   of Biomedical Sciences.

   Clarke holds leadership positions in several professional
   organizations. He currently serves as a member of the board of
   directors for the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges,
   serves on the AAVMC Strategic Planning Committee, and chairs its Data
   Committee. He is a member of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
   National Research, Extension, Education, and Economics Advisory Board
   and a past president of the American College of Veterinary Pharmacology
   and Therapeutics.

   Clarke has been honored with the Pfizer Award for Research Excellence
   and the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association's President's Award, in
   addition to having been recognized with a Certificate of Excellence in
   Teaching.

   He has been awarded over 40 research grants and contracts, including
   serving as principal investigator or co-principal investigator on more
   than $2.2 million in awards. He has directed six graduate theses and
   served on an additional 26 master's and Ph.D. advisory committees. He
   has over 68 refereed publications and has given numerous presentations
   at national and international meetings.

   Clarke continues to teach clinical pharmacology to veterinary students
   and has a professional interest in instructional methodology. His
   research has focused on interactions between bacteria, antibacterial
   agents, and host defenses; drug disposition and pharmacokinetics; and
   biosensor technology development.

   He received a bachelor of veterinary sciences degree from the
   University of Pretoria, South Africa, in 1981 and a Ph.D. in veterinary
   medical sciences from Louisiana State University in 1987. He obtained a
   master's degree in higher education from Oklahoma State University in
   2000.
   The [162]Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine is a
   leading biomedical teaching and research center, enrolling more than
   500 Doctor of Veterinary Medicine students, master of public health,
   and biomedical and veterinary sciences graduate students. The college
   is a partnership between the land-grant universities of Virginia Tech
   and the University of Maryland. Its main campus in Blacksburg, Va.,
   features the Veterinary Teaching Hospital and large animal field
   services which together treat more than 79,000 animals annually. Other
   locations include the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center in
   Leesburg, Va., and the Gudelsky Veterinary Center in College Park, Md.
