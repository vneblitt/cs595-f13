Research Findings

   The Rim Fire in Yosemite National Park, which was started Aug. 17,
   2013, by a hunter in Stanislaus National Forest who allowed an illegal
   fire to escape, had burned 237,341 acres as of Sept. 6, according to
   the [110]U.S. Forest Service. That made it California's third largest
   to date, requiring massive amounts of state and federal resources and
   personnel to contain it. To that point, it [111]reportedly cost more
   than $70 million to fight.

   How does this particular mega-fire fit into recent patterns? And given
   the general increase in large wildfires, particularly in the American
   West, what sorts of financial burdens is this placing on the federal
   government?

   "The total amount of wildfire management (WFM) appropriations for 2012
   was approximately $2.7 billion, not including an additional $407.5
   million appropriated in 2013 to repay 2012 WFM wildfire suppression
   accounts," notes an [112]August 2013 report from the nonpartisan
   Congressional Research Service (CRS). "Over the last five years, WFM
   appropriations on average have steadily increased relative to earlier
   years." The 9.3 million acres burned in 2012 was the third largest
   since 1960, the research service notes.

   The following chart comes from the National Interagency Fire Center
   (courtesy of CRS):

   Consequently, federal spending on wildfire preparedness and suppression
   continues to increase, as CRS illustrates:

   CRS-Chart

   These steadily rising costs continue to challenge agencies responding
   directly as well as policymakers and economists, who are [114]weighing
   the costs and benefits of doing more intensive and costly suppressions
   and preventative fuel treatments to avoid incurring huge expenses
   fighting large wildfires. A [115]2007 study published in the Western
   Journal for Applied Forestry found that, per acre, fires in California
   and the Pacific Northwest cost about twice as much to fight as those in
   any other region.

   Further, research [116]continues to find that the scope of wildfire
   burning is likely to increase in the coming decades, given climate
   change and a number of human-induced trends that are driving
   environmental change.

   Harvard researchers published a 2013 paper in Atmospheric Environment,
   [117]"Ensemble Projections of Wildfire Activity and Carbonaceous
   Aerosol Concentrations over the Western United States in the Mid-21st
   Century," that projects much greater extents of burned land through the
   mid-21st century. Under certain scenarios, the researchers state, "the
   annual area burned will increase by 24-124%, with the largest increases
   in the Desert Southwest where the area burned is especially sensitive
   to temperature." Further, they assert, "the length of the fire season
   increases by more than three weeks in the future atmosphere. These
   changes in fire emissions worsen air quality by the midcentury."
