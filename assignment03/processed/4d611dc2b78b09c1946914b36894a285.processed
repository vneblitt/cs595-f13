Science.gov Trivia Question of the Day: September 26, 2013

   [16]U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service Question:
   USDA's U.S. Forest Service scientists found that fewer spring snow
   packs are reducing the population of which burrowing mammal?
   Answer: The wolverine

   The [17]U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s [18]U.S. Forest Service
   (USFS) has been studying the range of the [19]wolverine, the largest
   member of the weasel family. Little is known about them because these
   nocturnal mammals are rarely seen by humans. Some groups have
   petitioned for the wolverine to be listed as an endangered species, yet
   lack of knowledge about their habitat range has hindered attempts to
   protect them. USFS scientists compiled hundreds of verifiable and
   documented records dating back to 1827 of wolverine occurrence
   (specimens, DNA detections, photos and accounts of wolverines being
   killed or captured) in the contiguous United States from museums,
   literature and institutional archives. This helped them determine that
   climate change and human development have reduced the amount of spring
   snow packs-where wolverines build dens in which they bear and raise
   their young-and as a result, have shrunk the wolverine's habitat range
   and the animal's numbers in the northern United States.

   [21]National Science Foundation Question: Developed with funding from
   the National Science Foundation, what item is being used as a
   microelectronic health monitor?
   Answer: A tattoo

   With support from the [22]National Science Foundation (NSF), engineers
   John Rogers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and
   Yonggang Huang at Northwestern University have been developing
   "electronic tattoos," microelectronic health monitors so thin, light
   and portable that they can attach right to the surface of skin and go
   wherever a person goes. The tattoos incorporate "elastic electronics,"
   a technology where the tiny monitors are fashioned from tiny, wavy
   silicon structures containing circuits that are thinner than a human
   hair. The devices are applied directly to the surface of the skin in
   the same way as a child's temporary stick-on tattoo. As the skin moves
   and deforms, the circuit can follow those deformations in a completely
   noninvasive way. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize the
   field of healthcare technology, yielding miniature monitors for muscle
   movement, heart function, brain waves and other body activities.

   [25]National Aeronautics and Space Administration Question: In 1996,
   where did President Bill Clinton urge NASA to search for signs of
   extraterrestrial life?
   Answer: Mars

   On Aug. 7, 1996, the [26]National Aeronautics and Space Administration
   (NASA) [27]announced that it had found possible microscopic fossils of
   primitive, bacteria-like organisms inside of an ancient Martian rock
   that fell to Earth as a meteorite. That afternoon, President Bill
   Clinton delivered an televised statement about the announcement in
   which he said, "I am determined that the American space program will
   put its full intellectual power and technological prowess behind the
   search for further evidence of life on Mars." The meteorite behind all
   of the excitement, designated [28]ALH 84001, was discovered in in the
   Allan Hills region of Antarctica in 1984. It is a 1.93 kilogram (4.3
   pound) mass believed to be about 4.5 billion years old that was blasted
   from the Martian surface some 16 million years ago and struck the Earth
   about 13,000 years ago. Of the 24,000 or so meteorites that have been
   discovered on Earth, only 34 have been identified as [29]originating
   from the planet Mars. While the evidence of fossilized bacteria in
   ALH84001 [30]remains controversial, it stimulated a concerted effort by
   NASA to search for life or the remnants of life on Mars.

   [33]Department of Transportation Question: Which U.S. president signed
   the legislation that created the U.S. Department of Transportation:
   Herbert Hoover, Dwight Eisenhower, Lyndon Johnson or Richard Nixon?
   Answer: Lyndon Johnson

   On Oct. 15, 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law Public Law
   89-670, establishing the [34]U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).
   On Nov. 8, 1966, Johnson nominated Under Secretary of Commerce for
   Transportation Alan S. Boyd to become the nation's first [35]Secretary
   of Transportation. He took office on Jan. 16, 1967, a little under four
   months before his department officially opened for business on Apr. 1,
   1967. Boyd served as Secretary until Jan. 20, 1969, when President
   Richard Nixon was inaugurated.

   [37]National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Question: According
   to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of
   National Marine Sanctuaries, the August full moon brings about an
   "underwater snowstorm." What is it really?
   Answer: The spawning of a coral reef

   Seven-to-10 days after the full moon each August, the reef-building
   corals of the [38]Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary,
   managed by the [39]National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA)'s [40]Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS), put on a
   fantastic spawning display that resembles [41]an underwater snowstorm.
   Each coral species in the sanctuary-located in the Gulf of Mexico
   [42]some 160 kilometers (100 miles) off the coast of Louisiana-time
   their gamete (egg and sperm) release for maximum benefit by avoiding
   the simultaneous spawning of other species. Most scientists agree that
   these mass spawning events are designed to allow genetic mixing and
   dispersal of offspring over large distances. The sheer volume of the
   gametes spawned allows for the fertilization and survival of a
   significant number of larvae despite the best efforts of predators.

   [44]U.S. Department of Homeland Security Question: For what purpose did
   DHS S&T develop an inflatable cylinder, 32 feet long by 16 feet wide,
   which fills with 35,000 gallons of air or water?
   Answer: To plug tunnels

   The [45]Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology
   Directorate (DHS S&T)'s Resilient Tunnel Project (RTP) recently
   designed and tested an enormous (32 feet long by 16 feet wide),
   pill-shaped inflatable cylinder that can be filled with 35,000 gallons
   of water or air (about the same capacity of a medium-sized swimming
   pool) in minutes to contain flooding or dangerous gases in a mass
   transit tunnel. The giant plug was developed in partnership with the
   [46]Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), [47]West Virginia
   University (WVU) and [48]ILC Dover--the longtime maker of space suits
   for NASA astronauts. When not in use, the plug stores within a small
   space in a tunnel, ready to respond in an emergency by being remotely
   inflated from the tunnel system's command center.

   [50]U.S. Department of Energy Question: Which Department of Energy
   laboratory was the birthplace of #video games?
   Answer: Brookhaven National Laboratory

   [51]William Higinbotham, head of the [52]Instrumentation Division at
   what is now the [53]Department of Energy (DOE) [54]Brookhaven National
   Laboratory (BNL), created an interactive game called [55]"Tennis for
   Two" for the annual visitor day in 1958. The game was run by an analog
   computer hooked up to an oscilloscope. Simulated on a screen was a
   vertical side view of a tennis court. Each player had a knob and a
   button. Rotating the knob changed the angle of the ball and a press of
   the button sent the ball toward the opposite side of the court. If the
   ball hit the net, it rebounded at an unexpected angle. If the ball went
   over the net, but was not hit back, it would hit the floor and bounce
   again at a natural angle. If it disappeared off the screen, a reset
   button could be pressed, causing the ball to reappear and remain
   stationary until a hit button was pressed.

   [57]National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Question: An
   isolated, freestanding wall at the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology's Gaithersburg, Md., campus tests the long-term effects of
   weather exposure on what?
   Answer: Stones from nearly all 50 states and 16 foreign nations

   In 1880, the [58]Census Office and the National Museum (now the
   [59]National Museum of Natural History at the [60]Smithsonian
   Institution) conducted a study of building stones of the United States
   and collected a set of reference specimens from working quarries.
   Sixty-two years later, a federal committee decided that it would be
   valuable to study the actual weathering of such a great variety of
   stone. In 1948, a test wall was constructed at the National Bureau of
   Standards (NBS, now known as the [61]National Institute of Standards
   and Technology or NIST) headquarters in Washington, D.C. It was moved
   to [62]Gaithersburg, Md., in 1977, where the agency had relocated 11
   years earlier. The [63]NIST Stone Wall contains 2352 individual samples
   of stone, of which 2032 are domestic stone from 47 states, and 320 are
   stones from 16 foreign countries. Over 30 distinct types of stones are
   represented, including marble, limestone, sandstone, and granite.

   [65]United States Geological Survey Question: Which January 17^th
   earthquake was more catastrophic, the 1995 one in Kobe, Japan, or the
   1994 one in Northridge, Calif.?
   Answer: The Kobe, Japan, earthquake

   According to the [66]United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Great
   Hanshin earthquake, more commonly called the [67]Kobe earthquake,
   occurred on Jan. 17, 1995, in the southern part of Hyogo Prefecture,
   Japan. It had a magnitude of 6.8 on the [68]Richter scale and was
   responsible for 5,530 deaths; 37,000 injuries; and over $100 billion in
   economic loss. By comparison, the Jan. 17, 1994, [69]Northridge,
   Calif., earthquake (magnitude 6.7) was responsible for approximately 60
   deaths; 9,000 injuries; and over $40 billion in damage.

   [71]Library of Congress Question: True or false? The Library of
   Congress has a copy of every book published in the United States.
   Answer: False

   Contrary to popular belief, the [72]Library of Congress (LOC) does not
   contain a copy of every book published in the United States. It does,
   however, house more than 155 million items on approximately 838 miles
   of bookshelves. The collections include more than 35 million books and
   other print materials, 3.4 million recordings, 13.6 million
   photographs, 5.4 million maps, 6.5 million pieces of sheet music and 68
   million manuscripts. The misconception that the LOC "has every book
   published" may have started during the tenure (1864-1897) of Librarian
   of Congress Ainsworth Rand Spofford, the man who opened the LOC to the
   public and greatly expanded its collections. Spofford successfully
   advocated a change in the U.S. copyright law so that the LOC would
   receive two free copies of every book, map, chart, dramatic or musical
   composition, engraving, cut, print or photograph submitted for
   copyright. Copyrighted items, of course, do not include every book
   published, but isn't hard to see how the confusion might have arisen.

   [75]National Library of Medicine Question: Which is older, the National
   Library of Medicine, or its parent federal agency, the National
   Institutes of Health?
   Answer: The National Library of Medicine is 51 years older than the
   National Institutes of Health

   Now the world's largest medical library, the [76]National Library of
   Medicine (NLM) originated in 1836 as the Library of the Surgeon General
   of the Army. Congress would officially designate it as the National
   Library of Medicine in 1956 under Public Law 84-941. The predecessor of
   the [77]National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Laboratory of Hygiene,
   was founded in 1887. The two would not become connected until NLM moved
   into its current facility on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Md., in 1962.
   Interestingly, the collections of NLM's History of Medicine Division
   had to be reunited with the rest of the library once the building was
   completed. The collections were transported from Cleveland under the
   watch of Pinkerton guards and with insurance coverage by Lloyd's of
   London.

   [79]National Aeronautics and Space Administration Question: According
   to NASA, what is the largest living organism visible from Earth orbit?
   Answer: Australia's Great Barrier Reef

   The Great Barrier Reef extends for 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) along
   the northeastern coast of Australia. It is not a single reef, but a
   vast maze of reefs, passages and coral cays (islands that are part of
   the reef). The white calcium carbonate that coats the living coral
   reflects light, making the water above the reef appear bright blue from
   space. This phenomenon allows the reef to be the largest living
   organism visible in [80]National Aeronautics and Space Administration
   (NASA) satellite photos and videos. Imagery from NASA satellites is
   being used to track the extent of coral bleaching in the Great Barrier
   Reef. Coral bleaching is the whitening of living coral due to a
   disruption of the symbiosis (two organisms whose living together
   benefits both) with its zooxanthellae, tiny photosynthesizing algae.

   [83]National Archives and Records Administration Question: Who held the
   patent, viewable on the National Archives and Records Administration
   website, for "anti-gravity illusion" shoes?
   Answer: Michael Jackson

   U.S. Patent 5,255,452--viewable on the [84]National Archives and
   Records Administration (NARA) website--was issued on Oct. 26, 1993, to
   the "King of Pop," singer [85]Michael Jackson, for a "method and means
   for creating anti-gravity illusion." The application abstract describes
   the patent as: "A system for allowing the shoe wearer to lean forwardly
   beyond his center of gravity by virtue of wearing a specially designed
   pair of shoes which will engage with a hitch member movably projectable
   through a stage surface. The shoes have a specially designed heel slot
   which can be detachably engaged with the hitch member by simply sliding
   the shoe wearer's foot forward, thereby engaging with the hitch
   member." The shoes enabled Jackson to lean forward to an exaggerated
   angle while dancing backward on stage, a move that became known as the
   "moonwalk." The patent for Jackson's invention expired on Oct. 26,
   2005.

   [88]National Science Foundation Question: What Web technology used by
   millions today--and funded in its early development stages by the
   National Science Foundation--was called BackRub in the 1990s?
   Answer: Google

   In 1994, the [89]National Science Foundation (NSF) made its first six
   awards under the multi-agency Digital Library Initiative (DLI). One of
   those awards supported a [90]Stanford University project, which in
   turn, funded the development of a novel Web search engine by graduate
   students Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Brin was supported by an [91]NSF
   Graduate Research Fellowship). While search engines at the time ranked
   results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the
   page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the
   relationships between websites. Their prototype search engine used
   well-established technology to crawl from page to page by following
   links. However, in addition to compiling a standard text index, the
   prototype also mapped out a vast family tree that reflected the Web
   links among pages. Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new system
   "BackRub," because it checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a
   site. Eventually, they changed the name to [92]Google, originating from
   a misspelling of the word "googol," the number one followed by one
   hundred zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was
   intended to provide large quantities of information.

   [94]National Technical Information Service (NTIS) Question: The
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration diving manual,
   available through the National Technical Information Service, says what
   type of chamber is used to treat injured divers: decompression or
   recompression?
   Answer: A recompression chamber

   According to the [95]National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) Diving Manual 4th Edition-available in print or CD-ROM from the
   [96]National Technical Information Service (NTIS)-"recompression
   chamber is the term used to denote a chamber that is used to treat
   injured divers." On the other hand, the manual states that a
   "decompression chamber generally denotes a chamber that is deployed for
   the primary purpose of conducting surface decompression." In other
   words, a decompression chamber prevents diving-related maladies such as
   decompression sickness (also known as "the bends") and carbon monoxide
   poisoning, and a recompression chamber is used to take care of divers
   already suffering from these problems.

   [98]U.S. Department of Transportation Question: The U.S. Department of
   Transportation's National Highway Transportation Safety Administration
   says what type of vehicle can have two or three wheels?
   Answer: A motorcycle

   The [99]Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), a nationwide census
   providing annual data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor
   vehicle traffic crashes, defines a motorcycle as "A two- or
   three-wheeled motor vehicle designed to transport one or two people,
   including motorscooters, minibikes and mopeds." FARS, operated by the
   [100]U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)'s [101]National Highway
   Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) since 1975, contains data
   on a census of fatal traffic crashes within the 50 states, the District
   of Columbia and Puerto Rico. To be included in FARS, a crash "must
   involve a motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway customarily open to
   the public and result in the death of a person (occupant of a vehicle
   or a non-occupant) within 30 days of the crash."

   [103]U.S. Department of Homeland Security Question: DHS S&T researchers
   worked with private and public experts on dams to develop a software
   tool that can simulate what type of disaster?
   Answer: Flooding

   A software tool that can virtually simulate catastrophic
   flooding--whether from a breached levee, failed dam, surging tide,
   landslide or tsunami--was recently developed through a collaborative
   effort between researchers at the [104]Department of Homeland
   Security's Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) and dam experts
   at DHS's [105]Office of Infrastructure Protection (within the
   [106]National Protection and Programs Directorate) and the
   [107]University of Mississippi's [108]National Center for Computational
   Hydroscience and Engineering (UM-NCCHE). The flood simulation tool
   allows users to forecast consequences, develop counter measures and
   even train emergency responders. It's so fast that a flood taking 24
   hours to inundate downstream areas can be modeled in less than 24
   minutes.

   [110]U.S. Department of Energy Question: Which radioactive element,
   discovered in 1944 at what is now a Department of Energy laboratory,
   makes it possible for ionization smoke detectors to work?
   Answer: Americium, Element 95 on the periodic table

   [111]Americium was discovered in 1944 by a research team led by
   [112]Glenn T. Seaborg. The scientists bombarded plutonium-239, an
   isotope of plutonium, with high-energy neutrons. This formed
   plutonium-240, which they also bombarded with neutrons. The
   plutonium-240 changed into plutonium-241, which then decayed into
   americium-241. This work was carried out at the [113]University of
   Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, now known as the [114]Department of
   Energy (DOE)'s [115]Argonne National Laboratory.

   The most common use of americium is in ionization smoke detectors. When
   americium-241 decays, it gives off alpha particles that ionize the air
   between two electrodes. This generates a very small electric current
   flow across the gap. When smoke enters, the alpha radiation is absorbed
   by the soot particles and the current is interrupted, sounding the
   alarm.

   For more information on Americium see DOE Jefferson Laboratory's
   science education site "[116]It's Elemental: The Element Americium."

   [117]National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Question: In
   2007, the National Institute of Standards and Technology celebrated the
   50^th anniversary of what computing achievement involving a baby?
   Answer: A photo that was the world's first digitally scanned image

   In 1957, computer pioneer [118]Russell Kirsch and his colleagues at the
   National Bureau of Standards (NBS) now known as the [119]National
   Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST, created a [120]rotating
   drum scanner and programming that allowed images to be fed into the
   nation's first programmable computer, the [121]Standards Eastern
   Automatic Computer (SEAC)--also developed at NBS. The [122]first image
   scanned was a head-and-shoulders shot of Kirsch's 3-month-old son
   Walden. The ghostlike black-and-white photo only measured 176 pixels on
   a side--a far cry from today's megapixel digital snapshots--but it
   would become the Adam and Eve for all computer imaging to follow. In
   2003, the editors of [123]Life magazine honored Kirsch's image by
   naming it one of "the 100 photographs that changed the world."

   [125]United States Geological Survey (USGS) Question:  What is the
   largest volcano on Earth?
   Answer: Mauna Loa in Hawaii

   According to the [126]United States Geological Survey (USGS), the
   [127]Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii has the largest volume of any volcano
   on Earth. Mauna Loa consists of about 80,000 cubic kilometers (19,000
   cubic miles) of lava and rises more than 17,000 meters (56,000 feet)
   above its base on the Pacific Ocean floor. Because of its massive size,
   the volcano has depressed the Pacific tectonic plate upon which it sits
   by about 8 kilometers (5 miles). More than half of the area of the
   island of Hawaii, some 5,000 square kilometers (2,000 square miles) is
   attributed to Mauna Loa.

   [129]Library of Congress Question:  What is the age of the oldest
   written material held by the Library of Congress: 250 years old, 900
   years old or 4,000 years old?
   Answer: 4,000 years old

   The oldest written material in the [130]Library of Congress (LOC) is
   about 4,000 years old, a cuneiform tablet from the reign of the
   Sumerian king Gudea of Lagash (2144-2124 B.C.E.). Cuneiform was
   developed by the Sumerians, who influenced culture and development
   beyond their original borders in Mesopotamia (present-day southern
   Iraq), site of the world's earliest civilization. Originally, cuneiform
   signs were pictograms, later, it also became syllabic. Reeds were used
   as writing implements. The tip of a reed stylus was impressed into a
   wet clay surface to draw the strokes of the sign--thus acquiring a
   "wedge-shaped" appearance. The clay was then either baked in a kiln or
   dried by the sun. The word cuneiform is derived from Latin--cuneus for
   wedge and forma, meaning shape. The LOC acquired its collection of
   cuneiform materials in 1929 from Kirkor Minassian, an art dealer.

   Answer: Surgery

   The [133]Edwin Smith Papyrus, the world's oldest surviving surgical
   text, was written in Egyptian hieratic script around the 17th century
   BCE, but probably based on material from a thousand years earlier. The
   papyrus is a textbook on trauma surgery, and describes anatomical
   observations and the examination, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of
   numerous injuries in exquisite detail. American archaeologist Edwin
   Smith discovered the papyrus in Egypt in the 1860s, and his daughter
   donated the papyrus to the New York Historical Society after his death.
   The papyrus is one of 11 rare and historic manuscripts available online
   and via an Apple iPad app on the [134]National Library of Medicine
   (NLM)'s popular [135]"Turning the Pages" website. Among the other
   virtual volumes offered are: Elizabeth Blackwell's tome on medicinal
   plants, [136]A Curious Herbal (1737); Robert Hooke's observations of
   the microbial world, [137]Micrographia (1665); and the book considered
   the world's first modern zoological treatise, [138]Historia Animalium
   (Latin for "Studies on Animals" and published in 1551) by Conrad
   Gessner.

   [140]National Aeronautics and Space Administration Question:  Which of
   NASA's Mercury 7 astronauts later became an aquanaut who explored the
   ocean floor: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper or John Glenn?
   Answer: Scott Carpenter

   One of the [141]National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
   original [142]Mercury 7 astronauts, Scott Carpenter, also lived and
   worked on the ocean floor as an aquanaut on board the U.S. Navy's
   SEALAB-II in the summer of 1965. Carpenter spent 30 days in the
   underwater habitat stationed at a depth of 62 meters (205 feet) off the
   coast of La Jolla, Calif. He commanded two of the three teams that
   conducted deep-sea diving activities on what became known as the
   "Tilton Hilton" because of the tilted angle at which the SEALAB module
   rested. Along with testing the psychological rigors of living beneath
   the waves, the SEALAB teams tried out new tools, experimented with
   novel salvage methods and evaluated an electronically heated diving
   suit. A bottlenose dolphin named Tuffy from the [143]U.S. Navy Marine
   Mammal Program ferried supplies to the lab from the surface.
   Carpenter's only trip into space was a three-orbit journey on May 24,
   1962, aboard the [144]Aurora 7 Mercury spacecraft.

   [147]National Archives and Records Administration Question:  In the
   film "National Treasure," the heroes uncover invisible clues to a
   treasure, including a cipher, on the back of the Declaration of
   Independence. What's actually on the back of the real document housed
   at the National Archives and Records Administration?
   Answer:  The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July
   1776"

   There is writing on the back of the original signed [148]Declaration of
   Independence housed at the [149]National Archives and Records
   Administration in Washington, D.C. However, it is not invisible, it
   does not provide clues to a treasure, and it does not include an
   Ottendorf cipher (which is used to decode a message hidden in another
   document) as the feature film, "[150]National Treasure," suggests. The
   writing on the back simply reads "Original Declaration of Independence
   dated 4th July 1776." It appears upside down on the bottom of the page.
   In its early life, the large parchment--75.57 centimeters (29.75
   inches) by 62.23 centimeters (24.50 inches)--was rolled up for storage,
   so it's likely that the notation was added simply as a label. The
   identity of the inscriber is unknown.

   [153]National Science Foundation Question:  Researchers funded by the
   National Science Foundation blindfold snakes to study what ability?
   Answer:  Thermal imaging, also known as "seeing heat"

   With funding from the [154]National Science Foundation (NSF)'s
   [155]Directorate for Biological Sciences, [156]biologist Michael Grace
   and his team at the [157]Florida Institute of Technology (FIT) study
   infrared (thermal) sensors in snakes. Pit vipers, pythons and boas
   possess special organs that form images in the brain of the thermal
   environment, much like vision occurs in the human brain. Thus, these
   snakes "see" heat, and this amazing system is the most sensitive
   infrared detector on Earth, natural or artificial. Research in this
   area will advance the development of artificial sensor technologies for
   industrial, defense and biomedical applications.

   [159]National Technical Information Service Question:  The National
   Technical Information Service was created as a result of which war:
   World War II, the Korean War or the Vietnam War?
   Answer:  World War II

   In late 1945, President Harry Truman set up a program to distribute the
   results of government and government supported-research which had been
   kept secret during World War II. Early in the following year, the
   Office of the Publication Board (OPB) was organized to distribute
   reports and The Bibliography of Scientific and Industrial Reports
   (BSIR) was issued to announce the materials available. Among the
   earliest items included in the OPB collection were captured German and
   Japanese industrial and military technology secrets. They were
   microfilmed and sold at the cost of reproduction to American
   entrepreneurs hoping to capitalize on advanced production methods for
   medicines, chemicals, textiles, etc. The current federal technical
   reports system and the [160]National Technical Information Service
   (NTIS) arose from the OPB effort. In 1950, the OPB became the
   [161]Commerce Department's Office of Technical Services (OTS). The
   agency was charged with making "the results of technological research
   and development readily available to industry and business, and to the
   general public." In 1965, OTS became the Clearinghouse for Federal
   Scientific and Technical Information (CFSTI) and then, in 1970, was
   renamed NTIS.

   [163]Department of Transportation Question:  According to the U.S.
   Department of Transportation, the longest road in the United States
   stretches between which two states?
   Answer:  Massachusetts and Oregon

   According to the [164]U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the
   longest road in the United States is US 20 which stretches 5.415
   kilometers (3,365 miles) from Boston, Mass., to Newport, Ore. US 20
   passes through the following states: Massachusetts, New York,
   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho
   and Oregon. From 1937 until 1963, US 20 was actually the second longest
   road behind U.S. 6, which began in Provincetown, Mass and ended in Long
   Beach, Calif., 5,877 kilometers (3,652 miles) away. However, in 1963,
   California requested that U.S. 6 be terminated at Bishop, Calif.,
   shortening the route to 5,193 kilometers (3,227 miles) and making U.S.
   20 the longest road in the country.

   [166]Department of Homeland Security Question:  In which city's subway
   system did DHS S&T test biological agent detection sensors in 2012?
   Answer:  Boston, Mass.

   The [167]Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology
   Directorate (DHS S&T) conducted a series of tests in the Boston subways
   in August 2012 to measure the real-world performance of new sensors
   developed to detect biological agents. The tests,  part of DHS S&T's
   "Detect-to-Protect" (D2P) Bio Detection project, involved releasing
   small amounts of a harmless, food-grade bacteria, Bacillus subtilis,
   into the air after the subway stations had closed. Then, sensors from
   different manufacturers were evaluated on their respective abilities to
   identify and confirm the presence of the released bacteria within
   minutes.

   [169]Department of Energy Question:  What was discovered in 1998 by
   Department of Energy and NASA scientists that completely changed how we
   view the universe?
   Answer:  Dark energy

   [170]Dark energy was discovered in 1998 by scientists funded by the
   [171]Department of Energy (DOE) and [172]NASA who worked at DOE's
   [173]Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and other
   institutions. Dark energy is the name given to the cause of the
   accelerating expansion of our universe and comprises more than 70
   percent of its total mass and energy. It was named by [174]Science
   magazine as the scientific breakthrough of the year because it was
   previously believed that the expansion of the universe was slowing, not
   accelerating. [175]LBNL physicist Saul Perlmutter shared the [176]2011
   Nobel Physics Prize for the finding. DOE and NASA are now developing
   the [177]Joint Dark Energy Mission to explore the properties of dark
   energy and measure how cosmic expansion has changed over time using a
   [178]large-aperture optical/near-infrared wide-field telescope
   operating in space. LBNL has lead responsibility for the DOE work. The
   mission, scheduled to begin in 2016, will be managed by NASA's
   [179]Goddard Space Flight Center.

   [181]National Institute of Standards and Technology Question:  In the
   2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah, the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology calibrated the timers for what
   competition?
   Answer:  Bobsledding
   Racers in the bobsled, luge and skeleton events reach some of the
   highest speeds of any Olympic Winter Games competitors--up to 130-145
   kilometers per hour (80-90 miles per hour). Since winners are often
   decided by mere milliseconds, the timing system for these events must
   be highly accurate and consistent. That wasn't a problem at the
   [182]2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, thanks to
   experts from [183]National Institute of Standards and Technology
   (NIST). The timing system for the runs at Utah Olympic Park was
   calibrated against the national time standard provided by the
   [184]NIST-F1 atomic clock in Boulder, Colo.

   [186]Library of Congress Question:  How much did the U.S. Congress pay
   for Thomas Jefferson's personal library to restock the Library of
   Congress collection destroyed in 1814:   $5,998; $23,950; or $75,236?
   Answer:  $23,950
   On April 24, 1800, President John Adams approved legislation that
   appropriated $5,000 to purchase "such books as may be necessary for the
   use of Congress." The first books, ordered from London, arrived in 1801
   and were stored in the U.S. Capitol, the [187]Library of Congress
   (LOC)'s first home. The collection consisted of 740 volumes and three
   maps. In 1814, the British army invaded the city of Washington, D.,C.,
   and burned the Capitol, including the now 3,000-volume LOC. Former U.S.
   president Thomas Jefferson, in retirement at his Virginia mansion,
   Monticello, offered to sell his personal library to Congress to
   "recommence" the library. The purchase of Jefferson's 6,487 volumes for
   $23,950 was approved in 1815. Not only was the collection more than
   twice the number of volumes that had been lost, it also expanded the
   scope of the LOC far beyond the bounds of a legislative library.

   [189]United States Geological Survey Question:  Where and when did the
   deadliest recorded earthquake occur?
   Answer:  China, 1556
   The [190]world's deadliest recorded earthquake occurred in 1556 in the
   [191]Shaanxi Province, central China. It struck a region where most
   people lived in caves carved from soft rock. These dwellings collapsed
   during the earthquake, killing an estimated 830,000 people. In 1976,
   another deadly earthquake struck in [192]Tangshan, China, where more
   than 250,000 people were killed. Worldwide earthquake activity is
   monitored by the [193]United States Geological Survey (USGS).

   [195]National Library of Medicine Question:  The National Library of
   Medicine main building was designed and constructed in the late 1950s
   to protect its collection from what type of disaster?
   Answer:  A nuclear attack
   The [196]National Library of Medicine (NLM), on the campus of the
   [197]National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Md., is the
   world's largest biomedical library housing more than 19 million books,
   journals, artworks, manuscripts, audiovisual productions and other
   materials. Because the NLM main library facility was built in the late
   1950s during the height of the Cold War between the United States and
   the USSR, the building incorporated many design characteristics that,
   at the time, were considered state-of-the-art means for protecting the
   collection from a nearby (but not direct) nuclear strike. These
   included a collapsible roof, floors and walls that would equalize the
   pressure of an explosion, and over 50 miles of bookshelves stored on
   three football field-sized underground levels.
