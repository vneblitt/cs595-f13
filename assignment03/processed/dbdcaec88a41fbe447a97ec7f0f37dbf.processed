Krypton

   BLACKSBURG, Va., July 24, 2013 - For many little boys, the notion of
   growing up big and strong like Superman is dangled in front of them
   like a rare gem by parents who are eager for finicky tots to eat their
   vegetables. "Eat your vegetables," they say. "You want to be big and
   strong like Superman, don't you?"

   But Paul Darnell, a 2005 Virginia Tech graduate in [160]human
   nutrition, foods, and exercise actually did grow up to be Superman --
   or at least his stunt double. Darnell appears this summer in the Warner
   Bros. "Man of Steel" movie as the stuntman for Henry Cavill, who has
   the starring role.

   Darnell has come a long way since his first part -- a straight-to-DVD
   production entitled "Evilution" in which he played a free-running
   zombie -- and has gone on to appear in major blockbusters such as the
   "Twilight" series as Robert Pattinson's high-flying vampire double and
   "You Don't Mess with the Zohan," when he was Adam Sandler's Krav Maga
   counterpart. He was also in "Captain America: The First Avenger."

   While Stunt Double 101 isn't a course of study in Virginia Tech's
   [161]College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, studying nutrition and
   exercise certainly seem like practical options for a superhero
   in-training. As an alumnus of the Department of Human Nutrition, Foods,
   and Exercise, and a former member of Virginia Tech's gymnastics team,
   Darnell laid a solid foundation for a career of flying, leaping, and
   otherwise performing physically preternatural tasks on-screen --
   movements that require knowing how his body works and how to feed it to
   perform optimally when the cameras roll.

   Darnell recently spoke to Virginia Tech about his career and his path
   toward becoming a stunt man.

   Q: How did you make the transition to stunt man and how did your degree
   in human nutrition, foods, and exercise help you along that path?

   A: After graduating from Virginia Tech I packed my bags and moved to
   California. My education helped me get a job at a physical therapy
   clinic so I could pay the bills while training and trying to land stunt
   jobs.

   I was on the gymnastics club team at Virginia Tech, which is an
   open-gym style, so I was able to train for all sorts of flips and
   tricks that a stunt man would need to know. Going to college before I
   started pursuing stunts really gave me the preparation I needed to
   become a successful stunt man.

   Q: Superman is one of the most iconic comic book characters of all-time
   - what was it like when you were asked to be the Man of Steel's stunt
   double? Did you do any special training for it? Was it intimidating the
   first time you put on that costume?

   A: Every little boy looks up to Superman and I was no different. I
   remember pretending to be Superman in my parents' backyard with a towel
   wrapped around my neck. So to put on THE actual superman costume, it
   was fulfilling one of those lifelong dreams. I was able to become the
   superhero I dreamt of as a kid. Quite a surreal feeling.

   Superman has the physique of a bodybuilder, so in order to look like
   him I started training and eating like a bodybuilder. I did intense
   isolated muscle group trainings with my trainer starting at 4:30 a.m.
   Monday-Friday.

   Q: How do you appear to fly on film?

   A: Most of the film is shot on green screen, which allows the editors
   to create amazing backgrounds and very realistic effects. There were
   different techniques used which included green screen and wires to make
   Superman fly.

   Q: When Robert Pattinson won an MTV Movie Award for best stunt from the
   "Twilight" series he gave a shout-out to you for your good work. What
   was he like to work with? What about Henry Cavill?

   A: Robert Pattinson is a genuine nice, good-hearted, deep-thinking,
   individual who I really enjoyed working with. I was honored to have him
   mention me during the MTV Movie Awards.

   Henry Cavill is also a truly amazing person. A man's man. Henry is
   pretty much a stunt man in the fact that he is super down-to-earth,
   very strong, and extremely athletic. Working with Henry is just like
   hanging out with one of the guys.

   Q: What scenes can we look for in "Man of Steel" and know that it's
   you?

   A: Henry did all of his own stunts in the film. I would rehearse and
   set up the stunts and Henry would come in and knock them out on film.
   The few scenes I am in while wearing the suit are so quick it would be
   very hard to spot me in the suit. I also make a cameo in the beginning
   of the film as a guard who Russell Crowe takes out.

   Q: What is the hardest stunt you ever did? How long did it take to
   shoot it?

   A: That has to be when I jumped from one moving truck to another while
   doing a running gainer off the end of one of the trucks in "You Don't
   Mess with the Zohan." It required one day of rehearsal and one day of
   shooting. My legs were so sore from the rehearsal that when it came
   time to shoot the next day I could barely walk. But it's amazing what
   you can make your body do when they yell "Action!".

   Q: You have a lot of photos on your [162]blog about food that you eat.
   Why is that important to you?

   A: I eat a plant-based diet. Lots of fruits and veggies! I avoid most
   sweets. I'm just not that into them. Some people have computers or
   other pieces of equipment they use at work; my body is my tool so I try
   to keep it clean and healthy.

   Q: You live out the Virginia Tech motto of Ut Prosim  (That I May
   Serve) in a very interesting way -- by conducting freerunning classes
   for kids. What are they and why do you do them?

   A: Freerunning -- which is an athletic and artistic way of expressing
   yourself while running, jumping, and interacting with your surroundings
   in a fluid style -- is my passion. It has changed my life and given me
   everything I have today. I created a gym, along with two friends who
   shared my vision, to spread our love of freerunning. It has changed our
   lives for the better and hope that we can instill in children what we
   have learned and that anything is possible.
