Introducing Power-Ups: Calendar, Card Aging, and More

   Posted on [7]August 7, 2013 by [8]Matthew Tse

   We get a lot of feature requests. A whole lot. Some of them are even
   pretty good. But there's no way we can fit them all in Trello without
   ruining the simple, core experience we work really hard to maintain.
   That‚s why we‚re happy to announce the launch of power-ups.

   Power-ups are board-level features that you can enable and disable to
   provide extra functionality. Power-ups will be disabled by default,
   keeping your experience as clean as possible. To see all available
   power-ups, click the button in the board menu sidebar. From there, you
   can enable or disable specific power-ups for the current board.

   There are three power-ups available for launch: calendar, card aging,
   and voting.

Calendar

   As a list-based task manager, Trello lends itself naturally to
   date-oriented tasks and projects. Trello has always included due dates,
   but the calendar power-up adds a full-fledged calendar view of your
   cards, as well an iCalendar feed.

   Some things you can do with the calendar power-up:
     * Quickly switch between week and month modes for a more specific or
       a broader view of cards
     * Drag and drop cards between calendar days to quickly change their
       due date
     * Click to expand calendar days for a roomier display of cards
     * Export an iCalendar feed of cards with due dates to your favorite
       calendar client

Card Aging

   Card aging helps you see cards on a board that haven't been touched in
   a while. When enabled, cards will visibly age with inactivity. There
   are two modes: ‚Regular‚ and ‚Pirate‚. In regular mode, cards become
   progressively more transparent and ‚fade out‚ the longer they remain
   untouched. In pirate mode, cards will tear, yellow, and crack like an
   old pirate map.

Voting

   ‚Wait, voting? Doesn't Trello already have that?‚ Yes. Voting can be an
   incredibly useful feature, but in the real world the majority of boards
   don‚t use it. So to keep things simple, voting has been converted from
   a core feature into an optional power-up. Voting functionality and
   privacy settings are the same as before.

   We hope you like them. Follow us on [13]Twitter, [14]Facebook, and
   [15]Google+ and let us know what you think.
