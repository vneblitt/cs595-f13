   Giant panda Mei Xiang (may-SHONG) gave birth to a cub at the
   Smithsonian's National Zoo 5:32 p.m. The panda team heard the cub
   vocalize and glimpsed the cub for the first time briefly immediately
   after the birth. Mei Xiang picked the cub up immediately and began
   cradling and caring for it.
   Behavior watchers have been monitoring her 24 hours a day since Aug. 7
   via the panda cams. The panda team began preparing for a birth when
   they saw her water break around 3:36 p.m. and she began having
   contractions. Mei Xiang started spending extended amounts of time body
   licking and cradling her toys Aug. 11, all signs that she could give
   birth. For the first time this year scientists used another test
   developed by the Memphis Zoo which analyzed Mei Xiang's levels of
   prostaglandin metabolite (a fatty acid) to narrow the window when she
   would give birth or experience a pseudopregnancy. Scientists at the
   Memphis Zoo performed the analysis and determined that if Mei Xiang
   were pregnant she would likely give birth during the last week of
   August. If she were not, her pseudopregnancy would have likely ended in
   early September.
   "I'm glued to the new panda cams and thrilled to hear the squeals,
   which appear healthy, of our newborn cub," said Dennis Kelly, director
   of the Smithsonian's National Zoo. "Our expansive panda team has worked
   tirelessly analyzing hormones and behavior since March, and as a result
   of their expertise and our collaboration with scientists from around
   the world we are celebrating this birth."
   Keepers and veterinarians will perform a preliminary health exam on the
   cub within the next 48 hours. Li Guo, lead giant panda keeper at the
   China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong,
   is at the National Zoo supporting the giant panda keepers. Li and the
   Zoo's panda team will perform health checks every few days during the
   next week. The panda cams will be briefly turned off when the team
   performs the health checks.
   National Zoo scientists detected a secondary rise in Mei Xiang's
   urinary progesterone July 10. The rise indicated that she would either
   have a cub or experience the end of a pseudopregnancy within 40 to 55
   days. In the weeks since, keepers and veterinarians have monitored Mei
   Xiang closely. She has exhibited behavior consistent with a pregnancy
   or pseudopregnancy since the end of July. Her appetite has been
   steadily decreasing, and during the past few weeks she has spent
   significantly more time in her den. Veterinarians had been attempting
   regular ultrasounds to monitor changes in her reproductive tract and
   look for evidence of a fetus since late June, but Mei Xiang chose to
   stop participating in them several weeks ago. The only definitive way
   to determine if a female is pregnant before she gives birth to a cub is
   to detect a fetus on an ultrasound. Mei Xiang's last ultrasound was
   Aug. 5, during which veterinarians saw no evidence of a fetus.
   Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated twice March 30 after natural
   breeding attempts with the Zoo's male giant panda, Tian Tian (t-YEN
   t-YEN), were unsuccessful. A team of Zoo scientists and veterinarians,
   including Tang Chunxiang, the assistant director and chief veterinarian
   of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda at
   Wolong, performed the artificial inseminations. During the first
   procedure she was artificially inseminated with a combination of fresh
   semen collected from Tian Tian and frozen semen collected from Tian
   Tian in 2003. The second procedure was performed with frozen semen
   collected from Tian Tian in 2003 and frozen semen collected from the
   San Diego Zoo's male giant panda, Gao Gao, in 2003. National Zoo
   scientists will perform a paternity analysis in the coming weeks to
   determine which male sired the cub. This is Mei Xiang's third cub born
   as the result of an artificial insemination.
   The panda team expects Mei Xiang to spend almost all of her time in her
   den for the next two weeks with her newborn cub. The David M.
   Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat has been closed to the public
   since Aug. 2, and will remain closed until further notice to provide
   quiet for Mei Xiang and her cub. Both will be visible on the panda cam.
   Visitors can see Tian Tian in his outdoor habitat and on the panda cam.
   Mei Xiang gave birth to her first cub, Tai Shan, July 9, 2005. Tai Shan
   was born as a result of artificial insemination and now lives at the
   Panda Base in BiFengxia in Ya'an, China. Mei Xiang gave birth to her
   second cub born as the result of an artificial insemination Sept. 16,
   2012. Six days after her birth, the giant panda cub died from liver
   damage caused by underdeveloped lungs.
