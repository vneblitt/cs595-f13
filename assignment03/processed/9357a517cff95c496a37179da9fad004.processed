American Diana Nyad, 64, sets record with Cuba-to-Florida swim

   KEY WEST, Florida (Reuters) - American 64-year-old long-distance
   swimmer Diana Nyad became the first person to swim across the Florida
   Straits from Cuba without a shark cage on Monday, succeeding on her
   fifth attempt at the feat.

   Her face sunburned and lips swollen, with barely enough energy to
   speak, Nyad waded ashore at Key West, Florida, after a 53-hour swim and
   told onlookers: "We should never, ever give up ... You never are too
   old to chase your dreams."

   In an inspiration to baby boomers everywhere, Nyad completed the
   estimated 110-mile (177-km) journey after departing from Havana on
   Saturday morning. She set a record for the longest ocean swim without a
   shark cage or flippers, according to her crew.

   She was met by crowds in Key West who surrounded her, snapping photos,
   as they enjoyed sunny beach weather on the Labor Day holiday.

   Helpers immediately placed Nyad on a stretcher and hydrated her with an
   IV before she was taken to a hospital.

   Nyad had been trying to achieve the crossing for 35 years, describing
   it on her website as her "Xtreme Dream," and seemed determined to prove
   The Beatles were right that there is plenty to live for "when I'm 64."

   "With all the experience I have in this ocean, I never knew I would
   suffer the way I did," Nyad told CNN in an interview.

   The first day was especially difficult because of winds and "even
   people with iron will quit when it's really tough," said Nyad, her lips
   swollen from exposure and from the mouthpiece of a prosthetic mask used
   to protect her from deadly box jellyfish.

   She said she told herself, "Forget about surface up ... With your left
   hand push Cuba back and push Florida toward you."

   Dave Magmone, whose boat was used to prepare Nyad's meals, said: "She
   has a mental and physical strength like no one I have ever known. She
   is an example for all people, regardless of their age."

   Older women and men have been inspired in recent years by a wave of
   older athletes breaking records and snagging headlines.

   Last year, then Colorado Rockies player Jamie Moyer, now 50, became the
   oldest pitcher in Major League Baseball history to win a game. Canadian
   Ed Whitlock, now 82, shattered records when he ran the 2012 Toronto
   Marathon in 3 hours 30 minutes. Dana Torres in 2008 at age 41 became
   the oldest American female swimmer to win an Olympic medal.

   JELLYFISH, SHARKS

   Nyad's team said her attempt benefited from several key factors,
   including calm seas, the surprising lack of jellyfish and favorable
   currents in the powerful Gulf Stream that flows eastwards through the
   Florida Straits.

   Ron Bartlett, her navigator, said the crew encountered only one minor
   squall and one box jellyfish sighting.

   The marathon swimmer had said this would be her final attempt, this
   time equipped with the mask as well as a body suit to better protect
   her from box jellyfish that forced her to end one of two attempted
   crossings last year.

   A team of ocean kayakers and divers accompanied Nyad on her journey,
   dragging an electronic device in the water that emitted a current to
   repel sharks.

   Nyad has spent much of her life in the water. She described in a 2011
   YouTube documentary how her father told her when she was a young girl
   that she was destined to swim, noting her last name is derived from the
   Greek word for water nymphs or female swimmers.

   Born in New York, the multilingual Nyad was raised in south Florida by
   a French mother and Greek-Egyptian stepfather. She swam six hours a day
   as a 12-year-old.

   She retired after successfully completing a swim from Bimini in the
   Bahamas to Florida in 1979, ending a long-distance career that set
   several records including one in 1975 for circling Manhattan in less
   than eight hours.

   She went on to a career in sports journalism and fitness, and has
   expressed a lifelong fascination with Cuba.

   The Florida Straits had been conquered twice previously, both times
   with the aid of a protective cage. The last time, in 1997, the cage
   glided on ocean currents and enabled Australian Susie Maroney, 22, to
   make the journey in just 25 hours.

   Nyad made her first attempt at the crossing aged 28 in 1978, when she
   gave up after covering 76 miles in 42 hours with the aid of a shark
   cage.

   With Key West in her sights on Monday, Nyad halted briefly about 2
   miles offshore to thank her support team.

   "This is a lifelong dream of mine and I'm very, very glad to be with
   you," she said, according to her website. "So let's get going so we can
   have a whopping party."
