Slowing the work treadmill

To aid creativity and achieve more, try doing less, HBS professor says

   The single most important thing managers can do to enhance workplace
   creativity is "protecting at least 30 to 60 minutes each day for
   yourself and your people that's devoted to quiet reflection," says
   Teresa Amabile, Edsel Bryant Ford Professor of Business Administration.
   By Chuck Leddy, Harvard Correspondent

   [83]Teresa Amabile compares much of work life to running on a
   treadmill. People constantly try to keep up with the demands of
   meetings, email, interruptions, deadlines, and the never-ending need to
   be more productive and creative. Yet on many days they seem to make no
   progress at all, especially in creative endeavors.

   "Many companies are running much too lean right now in terms of the
   number of employees," said Amabile, the Edsel Bryant Ford Professor of
   Business Administration and a director of research at [84]Harvard
   Business School. So the treadmill speeds up, compelling time-strapped
   employees to do ever more with less.

   Instead, it often would be better to do less, said Amabile.  The single
   most important thing managers can do to enhance workplace creativity is
   "protecting at least 30 to 60 minutes each day for yourself and your
   people that's devoted to quiet reflection," she said.

   Amabile has spent the last 35 years researching life inside
   organizations and how it influences employees and their performance
   (what Amabile describes as "inner work life"). Her research has spanned
   individual creativity and productivity, team creativity, and
   organizational innovation. Much of her work is included in her 2011
   book "The Progress Principle: Using Small Wins to Ignite Joy,
   Engagement, and Creativity at Work," co-written with Steven Kramer,
   Amabile's husband.

   During an interview, Amabile discussed how the ever-accelerating
   treadmill lessens creativity. "In the short term, people become less
   engaged in their work if their creativity isn't supported," she said.
   "They will also be less productive because they often can't focus on
   their most important work. In the long term, companies may lose their
   most talented employees, as well as losing out because they won't have
   the innovative products, innovative services, and business models that
   they need to be competitive."

   Instead, said Amabile, companies should unleash creativity by taking
   people off that treadmill.

   "Managers and employees need to work together to constantly prioritize,
   to figure out what is truly important, what they can forget about, and
   what can they push to the back burner in order to reduce time pressure.
   My colleague here at HBS, [85]Leslie Perlow, found that, in a
   department of harried engineers, it was powerful to simply declare
   `quiet time' in the morning, three days a week: no meetings with or
   phone calls to colleagues, no interruptions, no expecting immediate
   responses to emails. People were way more productive. They also felt
   less stressed and more satisfied with their work."

   Amabile described a time-pressured employee "who moved to the room
   where the boxes were stored and stayed there for the entire day, really
   getting into a flow state" of uninterrupted creativity. However
   achieved, immersion is vital.

   Managers, Amabile reminded, should be removing obstacles to creative
   work, especially in times of deadline pressure when uninterrupted
   immersion is critical. She offered the example of "one team that had a
   limited time frame to solve a problem with $145 million at stake. What
   the managers did was to clear the decks for that team, to get people
   off the treadmill. You have to basically stop that treadmill.
   Sometimes, that means physically separating" people from distractions
   like telephones and email.

   Managers also should provide employees with meaningfulness and a sense
   of progress, Amabile said. Her research has said that the latter ("The
   Progress Principle") is the biggest catalyst for creative work. Yet
   most managers don't understand how important "small wins" are to an
   employee's intrinsic motivation. "We know from our research with
   employees that `making progress in meaningful work' was the No. 1
   day-to-day motivator, and by a huge margin. Managers are really unaware
   of how important it is for them to facilitate progress every day, and
   to clear away obstacle to progress," said Amabile.

   To work creatively, people "have to feel like they're on a mission.
   They have to understand why it's important to get it done now;
   otherwise, it's like a death march. Meaningfulness is important, as is
   understanding the urgency, buying into it, and being able to focus."
   Managers can support these factors, thereby nurturing employees'
   intrinsic motivation when time pressure is unavoidable.

   If intrinsic motivation is so important to creativity, are extrinsic
   motivators (higher pay, promotion, and recognition) irrelevant? Amabile
   said that supporting intrinsic motivation "doesn't mean that extrinsic
   motivators need to be absent. Most of us operate under a combination of
   intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in the creative work we do. It's
   also important to make a living for what we do, to get recognition for
   what we do. What matters is that intrinsic motivation be stronger than
   extrinsic."

   Simply put, Amabile contends that individuals who can get off the
   treadmill when creativity is needed, and managers and companies who
   support them in doing so, will attain higher levels of success.
