George Zimmerman HANDCUFFED ON TAPE -- 'Get on Your Knees!!!'

   9/10/2013 2:10 PM PDT [29]BY TMZ STAFF
   George Zimmerman
   HANDCUFFED ON TAPE
   'Get on Your Knees!!!'
   Exclusive
   [30]091013_zimmerman_launch_v2
   It's like a scene out of "America's Most Wanted" -- cops swarmed George
   Zimmerman's car yesterday and ordered him to get down on his knees
   before handcuffing and detaining him ... all over a domestic dispute
   involving his estranged wife ... and the insane moment was caught on
   tape.
   Lake Mary PD just released the dashcam footage to TMZ, showing a police
   cruiser careening down the street and coming to a stop about 50 yards
   away from George's car, parked outside the home he shared with his
   estranged wife ... before she filed for divorce.
   It's all in the video ... police ordered George to get out of his
   vehicle, turn around, and get on his knees. George complied and he was
   immediately handcuffed.
   As we reported, George's estranged wife Shellie called 911, claiming
   George had threatened her and her dad inside their home ... gesturing
   toward his gun. She also accused George of punching her dad in the
   face.
   George was briefly detained for questioning following the incident, but
   Shellie eventually changed her story -- claiming no gun was ever
   involved -- and declined to press charges. George was eventually
   released without being arrested.

   Leave the poor guy alone. The Martins made off like bandits with the
   settlement from the neighborhood association. The son was worth more to
   them dead than alive.

   I think George is about to pop. All the stress he's been under, and
   having to constantly look over his shoulder is coming to a head. He
   needs help.

   She lied and later retracted her story. Isn't that enough to make you
   morons at TMZ just drop the matter?
