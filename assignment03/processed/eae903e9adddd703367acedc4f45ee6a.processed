Long-buried seawall protected New Jersey homes from Hurricane Sandy's record
storm surges
     __________________________________________________________________



   Forgotten seawall came to borough`s rescue. A relic seawall in Bay
   Head, N.J., dating back to 1882, was uncovered by Hurricane Sandy in
   October 2012. The forgotten structure staved off a significant amount
   of property damage.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., July 17, 2013 - Picture two residential beach
   communities on the New Jersey shore: Bay Head and Mantoloking, which
   sit side-by-side in Ocean County on a narrow barrier island that
   separates the Atlantic Ocean and Barnegat Bay.

   Before Hurricane Sandy landed on Oct. 29, 2012, a motorist traveling
   north on Ocean Avenue would seamlessly travel through Mantoloking into
   Bay Head, noticing few changes in residential development, dunes,
   beaches, and shoreline.

   The difference was hidden under the sand.

   A forgotten, 1,260-meter seawall buried beneath the beach helped Bay
   Head weather Sandy's record storm surges and large waves over multiple
   high tides, according to a team of engineers and geoscientists led by
   [160]Jennifer L. Irish, an associate professor of [161]civil and
   environmental engineering in the College of Engineering at Virginia
   Tech and an authority on storm surge, tsunami inundation, and erosion.

   The stone structure dates back to 1882. Its reappearance surprised many
   area residents, underscoring the difficulties transient communities
   have in planning for future threats at their shores, the researchers
   said.

   "It's amazing that a seawall built nearly 150 years ago, naturally
   hidden under beach sands, and forgotten, should have a major positive
   effect under the conditions in which it was originally designed to
   perform," said H. Richard Lane, program director in the [162]National
   Science Foundation's Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the
   research. "This finding should have major implications for planning, as
   sea level rises and storms increase in intensity in response to global
   warming."

   The discovery, now online in the journal Coastal Engineering and slated
   for the October print edition, illustrates the need for multi-levels of
   beach protection in oceanfront communities, the researchers said.

   "Once we got there, we immediately saw the seawall," Irish said. "The
   beach and dunes did their job to a certain point, then, the seawall
   took over, providing significant dampening of the waves. It was the
   difference between houses that were flooded in Bay Head and houses that
   were reduced to piles of rubble in Mantoloking."

   With recovery efforts under way and storms still circulating through
   the area, Irish and Robert Weiss, an assistant professor of geosciences
   in the College of Science at Virginia Tech, with Patrick Lynett, an
   associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the
   University of Southern California, documented high water marks, damage,
   overwash, and breaches of the barrier island.

   All oceanfront homes in the two boroughs were damaged, ranging from
   ground-floor flooding to complete destruction. As measured by water
   lines on the interior of homes, flooding was similar in both boroughs.
   The difference was the extent of the storm's impact.

   In Mantoloking, the entire dune almost vanished. Water washed over the
   barrier spit and opened three breaches of 165 meters, 59 meters, and
   35 meters, where the land was swept away. In Bay Head, only the portion
   of the dune located seaward of the seawall was eroded and the section
   of dune behind the seawall received only minor local scouring.

   Later, using Google Earth to evaluate aerial images taken two years
   before and immediately after Hurricane Sandy, the research team
   evaluated houses, labeling a structure with a different roofline as
   damaged, one that no longer sits on its foundation as destroyed, and
   the remaining houses as flooded.

   The researchers classified 88 percent of the oceanfront homes in Bay
   Head as flooded, with just one oceanfront home destroyed. In
   Mantoloking, more than half of the oceanfront homes were classified as
   damaged or destroyed.

   Despite the immense magnitude and duration of the storm, a relatively
   small coastal obstacle reduced potential wave loads by a factor of two
   and was the difference between widespread destruction and minor
   structural impacts, the researchers said.

   "We have a great deal of compassion for the people who have had to
   endure the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in Bay Head and Mantoloking,"
   Irish said. "It will have little solace, but we are left with a clear,
   unintentional example of the need for multiple levels of defense that
   include hard structures and beach nourishment to protect coastal
   communities."

   This research was supported by the National Science Foundation via
   grant EAR-1312813.

   Additional researchers include Wei Cheng of the [163]Department of
   Geosciences and Stephanie Smallegan of the Department of Civil and
   Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech.
