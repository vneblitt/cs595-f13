   AUSTINÂ â Enlivened by Fort Worth Sen. Wendy Davis'
   13-hourÂ [11]filibusterÂ to help[12]bring about the death of a
   controversial abortion bill, members of the band Bright Light Social
   Hour wrote an instrumental song anchored by protesters' chants of
   "Wendy! Wendy" in the State Capitol on June 25 and into the early hours
   of June 26.

   Bright Light Social Hour is a rock band from Austin, and members posted
   the track with video (taken from their phones) on YouTube. There's
   aÂ [13]free download on SoundCloud, or you can see it below:
