Look for the helpers in blue on move-in day

   With more than 9,000 new and returning students moving into the
   residence halls at the same time, August has the potential to be a
   little chaotic. Armed with moving carts, friendly smiles, water
   bottles, and helping hands, [83]Hokie Helpers aim to take the stress
   out of moving to Virginia Tech.

   "Hokie Helpers transform the arduous task of move-in into a celebration
   of welcome for our new Hokies, as well as those returning to on-campus
   housing," said Kenneth Belcher, senior associate director of housing
   services for the [84]Division of Student Affairs.


   Hokie Helpers help families move heavy items inside the residence
   halls. Hokie Helpers help families move heavy items inside the
   residence halls.

   Hokie Helpers are stationed near residence halls across campus during
   move-in days. Dressed in blue shirts, these volunteers provide
   directions and information, welcome new students and their families,
   check out moving carts, unload vehicles, carry belongings, and offer
   refreshments.

   "It is really gratifying to help make a family's first Hokie experience
   a positive one," said Sandy Broughton, the division's assistant
   director for communications and marketing. "I've been volunteering for
   Hokie Helpers for several years, and I've met people from all over.
   I've met all kinds of families moving in all kinds of things with all
   degrees of elation or exhaustion. It's nice to be involved in such a
   pivotal moment in their lives."

   While many faculty and staff members volunteer their time, students and
   student organizations made up a large percentage of the 1,200
   volunteers in August 2012.

   "It is the embodiment of Ut Prosim," said Belcher, referring to the
   university's motto, That I May Serve. "We have had students who
   received assistance moving on Wednesday of move-in week turn right
   around and volunteer their time and energy for the next three days
   helping others."

   students to chat with student volunteers. Vice President for Student

   Some students return to the Hokie Helpers team year after year. Others
   become even more involved, serving on the Hokie Helpers planning
   committee and working with the Division of Student Affairs to continue
   to improve move-in.

   "I really wanted to become involved with Hokie Helpers after my first
   move-in as a first-year student," said Weston Michael of New Hope, Pa.,
   a junior majoring in applied economics in the [85]College of
   Agriculture and Life Sciences. "The first few days as a first-year
   student are crucial, and Hokie Helpers become the initial link between
   campus and the students. When I was moving in, many of the students
   helping out had tips on how I might want to arrange my room and the
   best way to organize my belongings."

   The program is about more than physical assistance and helpful
   information, though. Hokie Helpers set the tone for new students'
   Virginia Tech experience to be one of service, belonging, and community
   involvement.

   "Typically, when you think of moving, you think about your family being
   around to help you and lend a hand," Michael said. "What is so
   interesting about Hokie Helpers is that while moving might be a family
   process, the other students helping are there to remind you that you
   are now part of a larger community and a new family."


   Students make perfect Hokie Helpers because they have ample experience
   navigating around campus and moving into the residence halls. Students

   In addition, volunteers help create an atmosphere in which students and
   their families feel comfortable and welcome.

   "Each year we receive thank you notes from parents telling us how our
   welcome made their arrival to campus smoother and less stressful,"
   Belcher said. "When you start off right, all of the other challenges of
   starting a new experience such as college and living on campus are
   easier to handle."

Look for the blue shirts

   Maroon and orange is the perfect color combination for Hokies. But
   Hokie Helpers wear blue shirts to help them stand out in a sea of
   parents, alumni, and new and returning students all wearing maroon and
   orange during opening weekend.
