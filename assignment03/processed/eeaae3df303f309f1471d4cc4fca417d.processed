   BLACKSBURG, Va., Aug. 13, 2013 - Virginia Tech selected Rachel Holloway
   as vice provost for undergraduate academic affairs. She will begin in
   her new position on Sept. 10.

   "I am very pleased that Rachel Holloway will be leading Virginia Tech's
   undergraduate academic affairs," said Mark McNamee, senior vice
   president and [160]provost. "As a faculty member, department head, and
   associate dean, she has demonstrated her commitment to excellence in
   undergraduate education. Her experience and knowledge of Virginia Tech
   will facilitate the development of this redefined vice provost
   position. I look forward to working with Rachel and the other vice
   provosts on furthering the growth of our academic programs."

   Holloway will oversee the strategies, programs, and resources that
   support the undergraduate educational experience at Virginia Tech. In
   addition, she will work closely with college deans, associate deans,
   and other vice provosts to coordinate strategic initiatives to advance
   Virginia Tech's undergraduate education profile.

   "I look forward to this position where I can be an advocate for our
   more than 23,000 undergraduate students," said Holloway. "It is an
   exciting time as we implement Virginia Tech's new strategic plan. I
   look forward to collaborating with others across campus to achieve
   goals laid out for our undergraduates such as enhancing our current
   Curriculum for a Liberal Education, increasing access for students to
   the courses and programs they need to be more successful, and
   increasing students' global perspective."

   Holloway will directly oversee areas that enhance the overall
   undergraduate experience such as academic support services, student
   success, University Studies, University Honors, First Year Experiences,
   undergraduate research, the Undergraduate Honor System, and the
   revision of the current Curriculum for Liberal Education.

   Holloway has served on the faculty at Virginia Tech since 1989. She has
   progressed through academic administrative and leadership roles, having
   served as undergraduate program coordinator, assistant department head,
   and head of the Department of Communication before assuming her current
   position as associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs in the
   [161]College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences.

   While director of undergraduate programs in the Department of
   Communication, Holloway received the 2002 Alumni Award for Excellence
   in Undergraduate Academic Advising from Virginia Tech.

   Holloway received a bachelor's degree in speech communication from
   Morehead State University, and a master's degree and doctoral degree in
   communication from Purdue University.

   Dedicated to its motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), [162]Virginia
   Tech takes a hands-on, engaging approach to education, preparing
   scholars to be leaders in their fields and communities. As the
   commonwealth's most comprehensive university and its leading research
   institution, Virginia Tech offers 215 undergraduate and graduate degree
   programs to more than 30,000 students and manages a research portfolio
   of $450 million. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of
   transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and
   by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and
   across Virginia.
