Anti-Women's Health Politicians Continue to Fight Losing Battles in Court

   On Monday, women's health had another victory in the courts, [46]this
   time in Oklahoma. A judge temporarily blocked a new law that would have
   prevented women from accessing emergency contraception over the
   counter.

   This isn't the first time this year that extreme anti-women's health
   legislation has been halted by the courts.

   Just a few weeks ago, a federal district court blocked a Wisconsin law
   requiring doctors who provide safe and legal abortion to obtain
   hospital admitting privileges--acknowledging that the law could not
   only cut off access to abortion, but in the process close health
   centers - and these are health centers that do not only provide
   abortion, but that women rely on for lifesaving cancer screenings,
   birth control, and preventive health care. In his ruling, U.S. District
   Judge William M. Conley said:

   "Even if there were some evidence that the admitting privileges
   requirement would actually further women's health, any benefit is
   greatly outweighed by the burdens caused by increased travel, decreased
   access and, at least for some women, the denial of an in-state option
   for abortion services."

   Similar legislation has also been blocked in Alabama, Mississippi, and
   North Dakota--where judges all ruled that these laws likely violated
   women's right to access safe and legal abortion.  These decision
   recognize what we know: the extreme laws anti-women's health
   politicians are pushing aren't in fact aimed at improving women's
   health and safety, but rather intended to limit abortion access (even
   if that requires cutting off access to basic preventive health care).

   Laws that tried to impose six-and 12-week bans on access to safe and
   legal abortion in North Dakota and Arkansas have also been blocked by
   the courts; meanwhile, 20-week bans in Arizona and Idaho were struck
   down. These rulings serve as a warning to politicians around the
   country trying to pass unconstitutional and dangerous bans on abortion:
   they will not stand.  Recently, when U.S. District Judge Daniel L.
   Hovland ruled on the six-week ban in North Dakota, he acknowledged that
   these laws aren't only unconstitutional, but they're a waste of
   taxpayer dollars. Judge Hovland [47]stated that:

   "[T]he State has extended an invitation to an expensive court battle
   over a law restricting abortions that is a blatant violation of the
   constitutional guarantees afforded to all women.  The United States
   Supreme Court has unequivocally said that no state may deprive a woman
   of the choice to terminate her pregnancy at a point prior to
   viability."

   If there's anything these court rulings have shown, it's that politics
   shouldn't have a place in women's health.  Women don't turn to
   politicians for advice about birth control, mammograms, or cancer
   screenings or treatments -- and politicians should not be involved in a
   woman's personal medical decisions.
