Center for the Arts brings choreographer Liz Lerman to campus to engage with
researchers, faculty, and students for dance-theatre project

   Liz Lerman Choreographer Liz Lerman's work-in-progress, "Healing Wars,"
   is an investigation of the impact of war -- from the American Civil War
   to contemporary conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan -- on medicine,
   healers, and soldiers.

   BLACKSBURG, Va., March 14, 2013 - Choreographer Liz Lerman and her team
   of performers and technical designers will visit the Virginia Tech
   campus during the last week in March to connect with researchers,
   faculty, and students for a series of unique engagement opportunities
   in conjunction with her latest dance-theatre project, "Healing Wars."
   This visit is part of an ongoing research residency that began in 2012
   and will continue over the next two years.

   Lerman's visit, which is sponsored by the [160]Center for the Arts at
   Virginia Tech with support from the [161]College of Liberal Arts and
   Human Sciences, will culminate with a public talk by Lerman and her
   colleagues on March 29 at 5 p.m. in STUDIOne, the Institute for
   Creativity, Arts, and Technology studio, at 460 Turner Street, on the
   ground floor of Collegiate Square, Blacksburg, Va.

   "[162]Healing Wars," Lerman's work-in-progress, is an investigation of
   the impact of war -- from the American Civil War to contemporary
   conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan -- on medicine, healers, and
   soldiers. The project explores areas such as the innovation of medicine
   during war, the role of the healer in conflicts, and society's
   connections to warriors. Lerman and her team are seeking new ways to
   tell this story, highlighting the emotions and the experiences involved
   while representing the ongoing tension between information and feeling.
   As with some of her more recent work, the choreographer is exploring
   projections as a means of solidifying setting, action, and emotion
   through the use of old movies, animation, and graphics as moving
   images.

   For the public talk, Lerman will be joined by members of her creative
   team, including performers Tara Pullman, a dancer who most recently
   worked with Dance Exchange, and her husband Bill Pullman, an actor
   known for his work in films such as "Independence Day," "Wyatt Earp,"
   and "Torchwood," as well as the project's sound and media designers.

   Residency activities with students in the [165]Department of Theatre
   and Cinema, part of Virginia Tech's [166]School of Performing Arts and
   Cinema, will give students a glimpse into the team's creative process,
   including how collaboration and rehearsals are used to further develop
   the work.

   Ongoing conversations with clinicians, soldiers, medical historians,
   and doctors have provided new dimensions to Lerman's work. While
   visiting campus, she will be meeting with a group of veterans from
   Virginia Tech to gather stories for "Healing Wars," while helping them
   develop a platform for creating their own work. Lerman and her
   colleagues will also meet with Michael Friedlander, executive director
   of the [167]Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute, and other
   scientists to learn how they are researching the brain, with a specific
   interest in how the brain perceives differences between imagination and
   experience.

   A choreographer, performer, writer, educator and speaker, Lerman is an
   artist whose dance-theatre works have been seen throughout the United
   States and abroad. She founded Lerman Dance Exchange in 1976 and
   cultivated the company's unique multigenerational ensemble into a
   leading force in contemporary dance until 2011, when she handed the
   artistic leadership of the company over to the next generation of Dance
   Exchange artists. Now she is pursuing new projects with fresh
   partnerships, beginning with a semester spent at Harvard University as
   an artist-in-residence.

   Lerman has received numerous honors, including a 2002 MacArthur Fellows
   "genius grant" and a 2011 United States Artists Ford Fellowship. Her
   work has been commissioned by the Lincoln Center, American Dance
   Festival, Harvard Law School, and the Kennedy Center, among many
   others. Lerman attended Bennington College and Brandeis University,
   received her bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of
   Maryland and George Washington University, respectively.
   Through a comprehensive arts initiative, Virginia Tech has made a
   strong commitment to the arts on campus and in the surrounding
   communities. The cornerstone of the initiative is the [168]Center for
   the Arts at Virginia Tech. Opening in late 2013, the Center for the
   Arts will include a 1,260-seat, state-of-the-art performance hall for
   music, theatre, and dance performance and visual arts galleries for
   traditional, digital, and new media exhibitions. Center programs will
   bring national and international artists to campus and celebrate the
   region's culture through performances, exhibitions, outreach, and
   learning opportunities. The center is uniquely partnered with the
   Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology, an applied research
   environment housed in the center wherein researchers from multiple
   disciplines partner to prepare students in kindergarten through 12th
   grade and higher education environments to succeed in a world that
   demands teamwork and collaboration, and to promote new research domains
   that transcend institutionalized boundaries.
