Event

   Ask Me Another in Washington DC
   Puzzlemaster Will Shortz and Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! host Peter
   Sagal walk into a bar...
   No, it's not the start of a joke. It's the essence of Ask Me Another,
   NPR and WNYC's rambunctious hour that blends brainteasers and local pub
   trivia night with comedy and music. Host Ophira Eisenberg invites
   in-studio guests and listeners alike to stretch their noggins, tickle
   their funny bones, and enjoy witty banter and guitar riffs from house
   musician Jonathan Coulton.
   Join Ask Me Another LIVE as we take the show on the road to our
   nation's capital - Washington, DC!
   On Thursday, October 10th, join Ophira, Jonathan and special guests at
   NPR's Studio 1, located at 1111 North Capitol St., NE. Come check out
   the new performance space at NPR's new building.
   Doors at 6PM
   Event starts at 7PM
   Tickets are $15.00. An additional $1.52 facility fee will be added to
   the price of each ticket.
   Following the show, Ophira will be signing copies of her book Screw
   Everyone: Sleeping My Way to Monogamy. Jonathan will also be signing
   copies of his most recent albums. All items will be available for
   purchase in the NPR Shop before and after the show.
