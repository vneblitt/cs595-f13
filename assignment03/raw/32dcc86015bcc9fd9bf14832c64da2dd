<p><strong>Denise Johnson</strong> had a system. Members of the audience at the Department of Housing and Community Development headquarters last Wednesday were supposed to write their questions on yellow cards and pass them to the front of the room. But when developer <strong>Tim Chapman</strong> finished presenting his plans to overhaul the so-called Big K site in Anacostia, the ground rules quickly evaporated.</p>
<p>“You think you can come in and give us any kind of bullshit?” one man shouted.</p>
<p>“Stop shucking and jiving us and telling us that we’re part of this process,” said another participant.</p>
<p><strong>Greta Fuller</strong>, the advisory neighborhood commissioner representing most of Historic Anacostia, stood up before Johnson, the DHCD project manager for the redevelopment, had a chance to begin reading the cards. “Why didn’t I get to speak for the community?” she asked. “I think that you blindsiding us with what you’re going to do does not help us.”</p>
<p>Fuller and other audience members then rattled off a list of complaints about the process and the plans for the Big K site, which involve five stories of apartments above ground-floor retail.</p>
<p>Some wondered how the guidelines from DHCD had changed so much from the initial 2012 solicitation—which stated, “The Big K Community Advisory Group recommends that the Site include no housing”—to now, when the project is predominantly residential.</p>
<p>Others questioned the scale of the development, arguing that a six-story building would be out of place in low-slung Anacostia. Fuller complained that the renderings of the new building appeared more in character with Columbia Heights than with her historic neighborhood. One participant urged DHCD to stop using the name Big K, which comes from a defunct liquor store on the site, when referring to the project.</p>
<p>But the most common complaint concerned the very nature of the housing that Chapman and DHCD were proposing. Their plans call for 100 percent affordable housing, available only to people making less than 60 percent of the area median income.</p>
<p>In neighborhoods like, say, Columbia Heights, the city and housing advocates have worked to ensure that low-income residents aren’t left behind as a wave of economic development passes through. But in Anacostia, residents are worried about the opposite threat: that in a neighborhood that’s on the cusp of development, well-off professionals will be kept out and the push for affordability will hold back economic growth.</p>
<p><span id="more-31200"></span>The fight over the housing at the Big K project highlights the ways that traditional debates about affordable housing can get flipped on their heads when high-end development begins to come to poor parts of town. Places like Anacostia can find themselves stuck in a strange middle ground, where the “affordable” units are out of the price range of most current residents but unavailable to higher earners who might be able to help bring much-needed dollars to the neighborhood. Residents say they understand the need for affordability, but question whether concentrating it in already struggling neighborhoods is a good idea.</p>
<p>D.C. typically defines housing that’s limited to people making less than 80 percent of area median income as affordable, with some units capped at 30, 50, or 60 percent. But the median income for the D.C. area, which includes the wealthy Maryland and Virginia suburbs, is more than $107,000 for a family of four. That means that the 60 percent cap at the Cedar Hill Flats (as the Big K apartments are being called) makes the apartments eligible to families of four making up to about $64,000, or individuals earning no more than around $46,000.</p>
<p>But the median household incomes in the two census tracts that make up Historic Anacostia are $30,313 and $19,519, according to the 2011 American Community Survey. These “affordable” apartments, then, are available to families making considerably more than the neighborhood average.</p>
<p>Chapman says one-bedroom apartments will be renting for between $1,149 and $1,189, while two-bedrooms will fall in the $1,300 range. No Anacostia residents I spoke with could think of any apartments in the neighborhood that are that expensive. (Several people mentioned Sheridan Station, the new development near the Anacostia Metro, where the upscale apartments are all rented out. But one-bedrooms there rent for as little as $750, and no more than $1,025.)</p>
<p>Still, it’s actually not the lack of true affordability for the neighborhood that has residents upset. It’s the fact that Chapman and DHCD are shooting for an affordable housing building at all.</p>
<p>“They’ve been saying for years that Anacostia cannot get retail because we don’t have the income,” says Fuller. “So how will you have retail if you have low-income?”</p>
<p>Fuller says she understands the need for affordable housing but would prefer a mix, perhaps with 80 percent market-rate housing and 20 percent affordable. She also questions how the retail Chapman and his architects envision—a “tablecloth-style restaurant” and other “higher-end retail” along the lines of Starbucks—can survive without a more affluent customer base.</p>
<p><strong>Danae Tuley</strong>, a real estate agent who’s lived in Anacostia for more than six years, wonders who exactly will move into the apartments. “I don’t know who it’s going to appeal to,” she says. “A lot of the renters here tend to have large families or people living together. So with predominantly one- to two-bedroom units, at that income level, I don’t know that that would appeal to the low-income demographic in this area.” Tuley worries that people from outside of the neighborhood still attach a “stigma” to Anacostia and won’t move in, and that with the apartments unfilled, the management may be forced to cut costs by trimming staff or shirking maintenance.</p>
<p>At last week’s meeting, several attendees suggested that what Anacostia really needs is rental housing for middle-class professionals. Current residents of the neighborhood who might want to move into the Cedar Hill Flats, as well as people from outside the neighborhood who find that the rents there are cheaper than at comparable places west of the Anacostia River, can’t move in if they make above 60 percent of area median income. That’s holding Anacostia back from the kind of economic boom that other neighborhoods along the Green Line have enjoyed, according to some neighbors.</p>
<p>DHCD Director <strong>Michael Kelly</strong> declined to comment through his spokesman, <strong>Marcus Williams</strong>, who said in an email that it would be inappropriate to comment on the housing affordability while DCHD is “still in negotiations with the developer to determine the most feasible financing structure for the project.” But he noted, “As the [area median income] and cost of living continue to rise throughout the city, the proposed Cedar Hill Flats would preserve affordable housing options for low and moderate income residents for the years to come.”</p>
<p>This is the crux of the city’s challenge. D.C. is, by <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2013/03/26/dc-named-least-affordable-market-in.html?page=all">some measures</a>, the least affordable housing market in the country, and so there’s clearly a need for more housing—lots more housing—that working-class Washingtonians can afford. The question is where to put it. The wealthiest parts of town aren’t seeing much new development of any kind. In places whose real estate has recently become hot, it’s hard to persuade developers to forgo big profits and set aside more than a small handful of units for low earners. (Developers of large new residential buildings are required to make a small percentage of the units affordable.) In the poorest sections of D.C., residents complain that they’ll never see positive change if the city keeps concentrating poverty there with new low-income housing.</p>
<p>And in places like Anacostia—a walkable, Metro-accessible neighborhood with plenty of retail-ready storefronts and a palpable sense that its time is just around the corner—there’s a feeling that dumping more affordable housing there will hold back the inevitable emergence from its current poverty.</p>
<p>Whether or not the development is good for Anacostia, it looks to be pretty good for Chapman. The developer, who declined to comment for this story, probably wouldn’t be able to charge more than the planned rates for apartments in Anacostia, regardless of any income restrictions. But because the units are labeled affordable, Chapman will receive a federal tax credit. Not bad, for someone who will <a href="http://www.capitalcommunitynews.com/content/disposition-big-k-site-will-take-18-months">reportedly</a> acquire the property from the District for $1.</p>

  			<p>Nice writeup. The last paragraph makes a point worth repeating: the "market rent" here will be considered "affordable" by federal standards, so the developer might as well apply for the tax credits available for affordable housing. It's free money, after all.</p>
<p>One concern that neighbors brought up is that the easiest source of tenants for brand-new apartments is the Housing Choice Voucher waiting list. Some neighbors don't want HCV recipients as neighbors, but the developer can't discriminate against voucher recipients and thus can't soothingly say "no vouchers."</p>

  			<p>@payton co-sign the point about low-income tax credit eligibility. This draws needed equity into the project and reduces need for local subsidy. Problem is that the author makes it sound as if the developer is somehow "getting over" by utilizing this well proven source of housing production.  The overall point of this article is unclear since the fact is that the project rents are at the top end for the neighborhood and cannot be seen as 'dumping' affordable housing.  Since the use of these tax credits will carry a long term rent restriction even if the neighborhood rents appreciate, perhaps the project will appeal to middle class residents seeking to lock in longer term affordability. Sounds great to me.</p>
<p>The author's "not bad" comment at the end is similarly misleading, and does not display an understanding of residual land value analysis. The absence of land value is likely a reflection of project economics and the government is uniquely situated to forego land proceeds to help deliver projects that the market is otherwise not delivering.</p>
<p>Maybe at some point someone will consider a story that highlights how the pendelum has perhaps swung too far in the democratization of real estate development such that implementation of established planning, zoning and development policies are subjected to this kind of heckling at every turn.  Existing residents and neighbors should have a voice in development policy but need to be held accountable to good logic, good policy and good behavior</p>

  			<p>I didn't think anything was unclear about the article. In fact, it's 100x's better than the original one that preceded this because Aaron appears to now have a better and less cynical/dismissive understanding of what's happening there. </p>
<p>Yes, the developer is essentially getting over because anyone knows it much easier to get LIHTC's in places like this and benefit financially because of the cost of aquiring and/or developing the property. That's not rocket science. </p>
<p>In order to get middle class residents to appreciate it, you MUST create the environment to draw them in. As much as most of us EOTR love our communities, many of us would not like to live in a 100% lower-income community simply because of the intractable problems it brings nor do we support the building of similar projects just to solve the citywide affordable housing problem. </p>
<p>And 1300 IS a lot of money for someone making 46k.<br />
Great article Aaron!</p>

  			<p>Same exact thing going on in downtown ward 7 with the new Park 7 word. I approached the subject with CMAlexander and her response was "everyone has to have someplace to live." But ward 7 has an abundance of affordable housing already. How does this raise the area income level which would give us bargaining power to attract retail and amenities? You can't keep dumping the burden of low income in one area. No matter what politicians spew, that affordable housing in DC is low income. You won't get working professionals who want to live there if the neighborhood isn't changing. She can't even keep the litter off the streets. Then they'll end up subsidizing the apts.  Park 7 is a project waiting to happen. A wasted opportunity.</p>

  			<p>I am glad to see this follow-up article.  As someone who is investing long-term in the community by moving into a market-rate condo at Sheridan Station, I am concerned about any new developments likely to affect future economic development in the area.  I also appreciate the need to include a range of incomes in any development subsidized by the government, local or federal.  But, I continue to be concerned by the statements that seem to dismiss our concerns by countering that this proposed development would offer rents and attract individuals making more than the average or median income in Anacostia.  We all hope that all new developments attract a significant number of people making more than the nearly  negligible incomes of the average Anacostia resident.  What we don't want to see are developments and policies that cap residents at a level that thwart the influx of higher income individuals and households, the people with real disposable income.  Sheridan Station was attractive to me because it offered me an opportunity to own in the District, right near a metro stop which is very convenient to work and in a neighborhood assessible to other amenity-rich areas (Navy Yard, Capitol Hill, Eastern Market, Barraks Row).  What was attractive to me (and other middle-class professionals moving to the area, esp. Sheridan Station) would be attractive to others, especially those making an income that makes other neighborhoods a stretch (Navy Yard, etc.). Yet, developments like this that would otherwise be attractive to such people, actually locks them out. How much disposable income does someone making at or less than 46k (pre-tax) have after he pays rent of a thousand-plus dollars? Not much at all. What kind of amenities can he support? Starbucks? Really?</p>

  			<p>The last paragraph is wrong. While the market rent and affordable rent may be the same today, that could change at any time. In fact, that's exactly what happened in most of DC over the past 10 years.  The use of tax credits and DHCD affordability restrictions means that future rents are limited to affordable levels for 30 to 40 years in the future.  By limiting future cash flow, the market value of the property is reduced today. Hence the $1 sales price.</p>

  			<p>@Jpl: Your argument has a logic flaw of its own. Just because the affordable rents for this project are higher than current average rent for the neighborhood doesn't mean the tenants necessarily would have a higher income than the current average. The restrictions are maximum income restrictions. So, for example, someone making very little to no income with a housing voucher would qualify, which does nothing but lower the average income of the neighborhood. That's the whole point of the opposing argument.</p>
<p>As the article and several commenters here have pointed out, the market rates for these apartments wouldn't be far off the affordable rates. So not having the restriction, or having an 80-20 mix of market-to-affordable as Greta proposed, would allow for the income mix of residents that the neighborhood wants. Keeping it in place seems to benefit only the developer through the tax credit.</p>

  			<p>developers can't win in that neighborhood.</p>
<p>market rate housing = "you're gentrifying!" or "you're not giving the neighborhood what it needs!" or, once it's built "why is this vacant?  you should have made it more affordable."  </p>
<p>affordable housing (which actually costs more than market rate) = "you're not giving the neighborhood what it needs" or "you're gentrifying--this is targeted at people who make more than the current residents" or "you're greedy for taking tax credits"</p>

  			<p>I like what Greta proposed. A 80/20 mix or a complete elimination of that dumb-ass income cap. Where they need more affordable housing (with income caps) is in places like Tenlytown, Palisades and downtown. It makes no sense EoTR since those of us who are NOT part of the 47% are trying to bring new retail and businesses to our community to make it more livable and safe. Concentrating more "affordable housing" won't help us meet this important goal and is ill-advised at best.  I LOVE THE FACT that area residents are finally speaking up and letting elected officials and developers know that ENOUGH is ENOUGH with the subsidized housing bullshit. If you don't want to live near it neither do we.</p>

  			<p>I agree the project should not be 100% affordable housing as the developer wants. That is not in the best interest of the community. However, I'm really troubled by the very classist sentiments expressed by some of those opposed to the project. Poor people are not the problem; concentrated poverty is. I live a couple neighborhoods over from Anacostia in Congress Heights, and like most people EoTR, I'm not trying to ship all the poor people out of my neighborhood. I just don't want poor people to be the only people in my neighborhood. </p>
<p>This project is a great opportunity to have development without displacement since no units are being torn down and no one is being kicked out to build it. But if the new tenants have the same income mix as what currently exists in the neighborhood, then that's not development.</p>
<p>While it would be great not to have to cross the river to go out to eat, enjoy a movie, shop for furniture, etc, these are not the things that most bother me about living EoTR. What bothers me much more are the limited educational and job opportunities, the disparate health outcomes, the way I see many of our kids EoTR behaving because of a lack of different models, their lowered aspirations for the same reason. The existence of a few poor people in the neighborhood doesn't cause these things, but concentrated poverty does. If we take care of that issue, all the other "amenities" stuff - which is just icing on the cake, driving or Metroing to 14th St really isn't that big a deal - will take care of itself.</p>

<p>1)Exactly what market rate housing was built in Historic Anacostia and people yelled GENTRIFICATION?</p>
<p>When Sheridan station was coming in, this article was published: <a href="http://afro.com/sections/news/Washington/story.htm?storyid=71758" rel="nofollow">http://afro.com/sections/news/Washington/story.htm?storyid=71758</a> including the paragraph “When we look across the District, new developments with high priced condos/townhouses, retail shops and commercial businesses priced the existing Black population out of their own neighborhoods. That’s not what we want for Ward 8,” said Muhammad.</p>
<p>2)What market rate housing has remained vacant in Historic Anacostia?</p>
<p>Sheridan Station (and I realize it may be slightly outside of the Historic Anacostia boundaries) where they couldn't sell enough market rate units to make the development work as planned, and needed to convert a lot of them to rentals (many of which are occupied by Section 8 voucher holders) see <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/housingcomplex/2012/06/06/sticker-shock/" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/housingcomplex/2012/06/06/sticker-shock/</a></p>
<p>Also, there are vacant single-family and small multifamily buildings throughout Anacostia.  Check out the vacant/blighted property lists at <a href="http://parkviewdc.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/vacant_all_1st_half_2012.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://parkviewdc.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/vacant_all_1st_half_2012.pdf</a></p>
<p>3)Precisely what affordable housing project has been built in Historic Ana where people have complained that it targets those who make more money that current residents?</p>
<p>I guess you've got me on that.  Nothing comes to mind.  But that could be because people didn't realize that units labeled "affordable" to people at 60-80% of area median income actually target folks earning more than what most current Anacostia residents earn, because AMI itself has increased, or because proposed developments didn't get built.</p>
<p>I'll stand by my idea that neighborhoods that make it hard for developers wind up with less development.  Some in Anacostia might like that, or feel that this development is so bad that it's better to have nothing built on the site.  And if that's what people want I don't have anything against it, but it's unlikely to get a whole bunch more middle-class folks moving in.</p>

  			<p>@sbc.  I understood the problem that Sheridan Station had was with appraisals coming in too low to cover the cost of building- not with a lack of interest from potential buyers.  Indeed, the Sheridan Station condos/townhouses are sold out, and there is now a waiting list. And my sense is that most of the buyers are solidly middle-class.  The income cut-off for the workforce pricing is 86K.  I know of at least one other attorney who has purchased there (a corporate attorney), and a young dentist bought the unit above me.  Middle class professionals are certainly interested in moving to Anacostia.  But, I worry that we are seeing developments that make it less attractive (or impossible) for them to do so.</p>

  			<p>The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is not a subsidy for tenants. It is an incentive for developers to invest in affordable housing, as opposed to market rate. It comes with maximum income levels, adjusted for household size. It also comes with minimum income requirements, in that applicants' incomes have to "qualify" for set rents, paying the federal standard of no more than 30% of income for rent. For rough example, a single person making $24,000 annually would qualify for a rent of not more than $600 (30% = 7200 divided by 12mos.)<br />
There are also rent caps, which are determined by locality; for the DMV metropolitan area they are:  1BR $1,209  2BR $1,452  3BR $1,677<br />
for incomes at 60% of Area Median Income level<br />
(appr.$65,000 for a household of 4 persons).<br />
Language<br />
"Southeast",used interchangeably for Anacostia,has a "bad reputation" which in reality may not match neighborhood by neighborhood.<br />
Boosters have adopted "East of the River" as a non-perjorative designation. Poor people don't want live in SE DC either, but the rents are depressed because of the perception, and thus "affordable" by market standards, not by any govt intervention.<br />
The LIHTC program is designed for affordable housing for working households. It differs from Section 8 in that the rent does not change with income fluctuations.<br />
As pointed out, new development on vacant land is not displacing existing residents. It will bring higher income residents, with some disposable income to attract the amenities desired by long-term residents who already have (as in "Them that have")affordable housing because of rent control or home ownership.<br />
The eventual impact, as in Columbia Heights, will be that landlords/homeowners will be able to demand higher prices as the neighborhood changes, making housing "unaffordable" for those on lower and fixed incomes. That is where government policy and commitment has to intervene to maintain housing for all.</p>

<p>Interest from potential buyers doesn't mean much if they can't get a loan approved to actually buy. Financing matters a great deal, both for end-users (e.g. condo buyers) and for developers. If a developer can't sell condos, a bank won't give him a loan for construction, either. </p>
<p>I completely understand the desire for market-rate housing in this location, but I also understand that such financing might not be possible.</p>

  			<p>Great to see the interest in this article. Hopefully people not familiar with the neighborhoods of east of the River will learn a little more by understanding this current situation in the neighborhood of Anacostia. A situation faced by many such as mine in Congress Heights.</p>
<p>I've lived in Ward 8 since 2007 and have been blogging on the area since 2008. I definetly have a lot to say on this subject (having written about it for years) but my comments will be entirely too long for this post. </p>
<p>If anyone is interested I addressed this post in a response I posted yesterday. You can find it here: <a href="http://www.congressheightsontherise.com/2013/09/concentrating-affordable-housing-east.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.congressheightsontherise.com/2013/09/concentrating-affordable-housing-east.html</a></p>

  			<p>@Rosesdc: Thanks for the additional info on LIHTC. One thing I've been wondering is if the developer gets a higher LIHTC by setting a lower income restriction. For example, if the developer proposed setting the restriction at 80% of AMI instead of 60%, would that have meant a lower LIHTC for him?</p>
<p>Also, looking at the numbers in the article and the minimum income guidelines you noted, it seems single person HHs are automatically excluded. With the lowest rent at $1149/mo, the minimum income needed would be $45,960, which is over the income maximum of $45,150 for a single person HH. Even a 2-person HH must fall in a narrow income band to qualify for the cheapest 1 BR unit. They would have to make at least $45,960 but no more than $51,600 to qualify. I imagine that's a small part of the market. So it almost seems like this is designed to be filled with voucher holders. Which, like the LIHTC, is great for the developer, investors, and management company, but not so much for the community and tenants still living in concentrated poverty.</p>

<p>I felt as if the only place you could've been talking about was the Sheridan Station project (composed of apts and townhomes) which as you acknowledge is not w/in Historic Anacostia. The reason I mention this is because we often generalize everything EOTR-related. </p>
<p>At a minimum you are talking about only ONE project. Therefore, your belief that developers can't win based on what's happening w/this project doesn't comport w/the also valid concerns of the Sheridan project. So it's one of those unfair generalizations where you've compared two dissimilar projects/concerns. </p>
<p>You are absolutely right that there a lots of vacant/blighted homes. But where are the host of market rate ones you used in your criticism about what people always complain about?</p>
<p>It's reasonable for you to stand by your belief that n'hoods can make it hard for developers. But you're wrong to make that claim about THIS n'hood. And you're right, not building anything on the site won't move the middle class people in. And as has been discussed here, neither will a new development w/100% of the renters and their families who make less than 46k.</p>

  			<p>@sbc: Sheridan Station has both rental units and for sale units. As Darin pointed out, the for sale units initially had a problem getting appraised at the amount the developer wanted to charge, but they added a workforce pricing program and all of those units are now sold out. None of them were converted to rentals.</p>
<p>The rental units have never had any issue with lease ups. I believe they are also income-restricted/affordable housing units. Which gets us back to the problem the community is pointing out: why is all of the new development in the area allocated to affordable housing in an area that already offers the most affordable housing in the city? Anacostia and other EoTR neighborhoods have newly-developed, market-rate for sale housing, but no newly-developed, market-rate rental housing. That's the big hole in the market that's missing for us.</p>

  			<p>This article and the conversation that follows is focused on a very real problem regarding rental development in distressed and emerging areas of the city.   Currently, the only feasible program for financing rental housing in a neighborhood like Anacostia is the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program.  In exchange for vast amounts of equity, developers must agree to restrict units to families at or below 60% of AMI for up to 20 years, and the District usually requires an additional 20.  Developers are not required to make every unit tax credit, but for every unit they remove from the program they can lose up t0 $30,000 per unit of equity.  In order to make up the equity, the developer needs to raise rents.  That's easy enough right?  Well, the problem is the rent raise is required to be at least up to $2500 a month for a 1 BR apartment to cover the gap.  In areas downtown this makes sense, however in neighborhoods like Anacostia no developer will take the risk on a $2500 1 BR rent, nor will any banking institution underwriting it.  SO what you have, it an unintended consequence of the tax credit program, which is the prevention of truly mixed income housing in emerging neighborhoods.  While changing the program is unlikely, the city could change the paradigm by encouraging developer's to take the risk on market units in tax credit developments by providing subsidy or guarantees for such units.  The problem there, of course, is that the advocate community is totally and completely opposed to subsidy being diverted from low income units.</p>

  			<p>@ SEis4Me and PG2SE, I'm glad we're having a conversation about this--I think there are enough facts and anecdotes to support a variety of opinions.  </p>
<p>I agree that Sheridan Station is not the same as Anacostia or SE as a whole, and certainly not the historic district.</p>
<p>But Sheridan Square is only about 0.4 miles away from the Big K site discussed in this article and thus many neighborhood factors are similar.  I don't think it's an "unfair generalization" to compare community response to the two projects.  </p>
<p>If Sheridan Station had to add "a workforce pricing program" to sell out, it means the finances didn't work as planned to sell at purely market rate.  According the website, "you must make under $86,000" (this sounds like 80% of AMI)for the workforce units and "you will sign an agreement with the City in which you agree to pay back some of the subsidy invested in the unit and agree to share a small portion of equity with the City at time of resale. Affordable unit buyers may not lease their home."  This is not market rate housing.  And while none of the units physically built for homeownership were converted to rental, the developer did tell the zoning commission that the second phase of their project would have to change from 85 market rate for-sale and 65 affordable rental to 65 public housing units and 68 tax credit rental.  <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/housingcomplex/files/2012/06/Sheridan-Station-modification.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/housingcomplex/files/2012/06/Sheridan-Station-modification.pdf</a>  I will admit I only know about this from reading about it and perhaps this didn't actually come to pass in the way the developers told the zoning commission it would.</p>
<p>As to the point that "You are absolutely right that there a lots of vacant/blighted homes. But where are the host of market rate ones you used in your criticism about what people always complain about?"  I described the vacant/blighted properties in response to your question "What market rate housing has remained vacant in Historic Anacostia?"  The answer, as the DCRA list shows, is quite a lot of market rate housing is vacant in Historic Anacostia--and the neighborhoods immediately around it, too.  Those vacant/blighted properties ARE market rate. They don't have a subsidy, they're sold on the conventional real estate market, etc.  And when they are purchased and resold, some people get upset.  There were people mad at David Garber when he flipped a house in Historic Anacostia, an ANC commissioner called a new resident of the neighborhood "white trailer trash" <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/27772/trash-talking" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/27772/trash-talking</a> , and middle-class people of all races have described friction when moving to Anacostia  <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-07-28/lifestyle/35267374_1_black-professionals-black-gentrification-white-residents/2" rel="nofollow">http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-07-28/lifestyle/35267374_1_black-professionals-black-gentrification-white-residents/2</a>.  Now I'm not saying this is everyone or even most people.  There are friendly and unfriendly people in all neighborhoods, and most people would rather live next to a fixed-up house than a vacant one.  But developers want to go where people are glad to see them, not where they're shouted down at community meetings. That's not the only reason why Anacostia doesn't have a lot of market rate, non-subsidized rental housing (which I agree with you, might be a good thing for the neighborhood to include if it could be made to exist):<br />
* Marion Barry has opposed building more rental housing in Ward 8 <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/housingcomplex/2011/07/11/barry-no-more-renters-in-ward-8/" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/housingcomplex/2011/07/11/barry-no-more-renters-in-ward-8/</a><br />
* the market rent is so low that developers can't afford to build without a subsidy like tax credits, which require income targeting<br />
* the historic district rules make it hard to build densely--and density is important if you're going to make money when charging low rent, since costs like advertising, hiring a property manager, etc. are somewhat<br />
fixed</p>
<p>Finally, and as much as I really love talking about this stuff I don't think I can devote any more time to it right now, I also don't think it's accurate to say the residents of the proposed Big K development will be "100% of the renters and their families who make less than 46k."  A single person could earn under $46k.  A family of 4 would earn up to $64k.  Either way, that's not exactly poor.  Certainly it leaves enough disposable income for the occasional starbucks or a purchase at another business that might move in.</p>

<p>"Also, looking at the numbers in the article and the minimum income guidelines you noted, it seems single person HHs are automatically excluded. With the lowest rent at $1149/mo, the minimum income needed would be $45,960, which is over the income maximum of $45,150 for a single person HH. Even a 2-person HH must fall in a narrow income band to qualify for the cheapest 1 BR unit. They would have to make at least $45,960 but no more than $51,600 to qualify. I imagine that's a small part of the market. So it almost seems like this is designed to be filled with voucher holders. Which, like the LIHTC, is great for the developer, investors, and management company, but not so much for the community and tenants still living in concentrated poverty."</p>
<p>And that is the God's honest truth. This is set up perfectly for more vouchers and we have seen that over and over and over again. </p>
<p>And for SBC I appreciate you contributing to the discussion but when all of your first-hand information comes from WCP articles (which are not always the most accurate) maybe just maybe you don't know more than us who live here every single day and own here and have the 5 subsidized buildings and transitional housing complexes on our block. The God's honest truth is that there is not one single middle to high end rental property in all of Ward 8 that I can think of that a single professional could or would get into that doesn't have an income cap. That's a problem. It's not from a lack of interest -- there is definetly a demand but there is no supply and I think several people on this thread have accurately explained why developers are not creating the supply. </p>
<p>In terms of the vacant residential property in Anacostia I don't know who you are talking to but the single family market in Anacostia is hot, very hot. The few blighted vacant buildings you see in the historic district have a story behind them. Usually taxes, absentee property owner, and sometimes the properties are owned by the DC government. There are a lot of people who have been buying homes the past 5 - 7 years in Anacostia and most of them have been middle class professionals. It seems that this only came on the radar for most folks when White middle class professionals followed suit. </p>
<p>Anacostia is very hot now and will continue to be hot and I totally understand why the residents -- many homeowners -- want to put their foot down and advocate for their community. In truth if they don't who the hell will?</p>
<p>P.S. I work in Anacostia and live in Congress Heights so I may just have an idea of what I am talking about. :)</p>

  			<p>SBC, thanks again. I was about to respond but TheAdvocate essentially covered what I wanted to say. </p>
<p>Although a bit off topic, while there is a limited supply of places w/no income cap, even those that do presents challenges for a single person. I imagine these same issues might exist WOTR. I would've loved to purchase in CityHomes but the income restriction basically priced me out. </p>
<p>I also would like to know where the hoards of blighted market rate homes are because I haven't seen them. Blighted = market rate sounds strange. </p>
<p>BTW, I'm sure I can list several projects WOTR finding anecdotes where people make all sorts of claims about a potential project and the developer STILL moves in and completes the work. It's akin to suggesting that the WCP shouldn't exist because people complain in the comments section. I mean, why would WCP want to continue to reach out to the metro area when receiving such backlash from the "community."</p>

  			<p>@Matt: Why would the 1 BR rent for a non-income restricted unit need to be at least $2500? There was an article in the Ready to Rent section of today's Express talking about the H St area. One complex, 360 H, has 1 BRs starting at $2075. Another complex,<br />
The Flats at Atlas, has them starting at $1575. I seriously doubt these developers got their land for $1. So if they can find a way to make a profit w/ rents well under $2500 on a 1 BR and no LIHTC units, why wouldn't this developer be able to?</p>

  			<p>As a Historic Anacostia homeowner I really don't care about the affordable housing debate too much. If units are needed put them on another vacant lot. For me its all about preserving the historic nature of Anacostia. Which is the sentiment that was expressed by many community members at the meeting on Sept 4th. The whole AMI debate was a small portion of what was discussed. The majority of the concern was focused on the developer not listening to what current residents would like to see in our community, instead DCHD and the developer are dictating what they feel is best for us. I don't understand why its okay to deface our historic district with these new residential units. Those houses could totally be moved forward on their current lots and turned into store fronts.</p>

  			<p>@sbc: You say because the for sale units at Sheridan Station used a workforce pricing program that these houses weren't market rate. That's not necessarily true. Market rate is whatever rate the market will support. Just because the developer couldn't get their original asking price doesn't mean the price they were originally asking for was market rate. It just means that's the price they settled on to recover their costs and get the profit margin they wanted. </p>
<p>WC Smith (the Sheridan Station developer) would probably claim that w/o whatever subsidies or tax credits they got for offering workforce pricing, the development wouldn't have worked. Maybe, maybe not. They certainly have a vested interest in making that claim. For my part, I find the claim rather suspect when you have small-time, private investors doing flips in the area who are making a profit on renovations offering similar and/or better amenities to the Sheridan Station townhouses and condos. If these investors, who don't get favorable land deals from the gov't and don't have the economy-of-scale advantages that large developers do, can make a profit at market rate, why can't these developers?</p>

<p>I do not agree with your comments (that I have posted below.)  I have means and live here (many others too).  I choose to live here because of the many redeeming qualities this area has.  As a pragmatic, I am willing to work hard, contribute to my neighborhood, and champion my community.  This is called being a great citizen- these people are the best people to have live next to you.  All these people that you feel are idealist and causing your premise of  "damned if you, damned if you don't" are too.</p>
<p>I understand business very well and the importance of the economics in decision making; AND therefore I also know that profit takes full reign the without a check on it.  By way of comments in this post you have been introduced to "the check" which takes into this account the wellbeing of people within Anacostia..... Meet the "Balancers".</p>

  			<p>[...] These affordable apartments, then, are available to families making considerably more than the neighborhood average. Chapman says one-bedroom apartments will be renting for between $1,149 and $1,189, while two-bedrooms will fall in the $1,300 range. No Anacostia residents I spoke with could think of any apartments in the neighborhood that are that expensive.

But in Anacostia, residents are worried about the opposite threat: that in a neighborhood thats on the cusp of development, well-off professionals will be kept out and the push for affordability will hold back economic growth. The fight over the housing at the Big K project highlights the ways that traditional debates about affordable housing can get flipped on their heads when high-end development begins to come to poor parts of town.

  			<p>[...] But the median income for the D.C. area, which includes the wealthy Maryland and Virginia suburbs, is more than $107,000 for a family of four. That means that the 60 percent cap at the Cedar Hill Flats (as the Big K apartments are being called) makes the apartments eligible to families of four making up to about $64,000, or individuals earning no more than around $46,000. But the median household incomes in the two census tracts that make up Historic Anacostia are $30,313 and $19,519, according to the 2011 American Community Survey.

  			<p>[...] The question is where to put it. The wealthiest parts of town arent seeing much new development of any kind. In places whose real estate has recently become hot, its hard to persuade developers to forgo big profits and set aside more than a small handful of units for low earners. residential property management maryland (Developers of large new residential buildings are required to make a small percentage of the units affordable.) In the poorest sections of D.C., residents complain that theyll never see positive change if the city keeps concentrating poverty there with new low-income housing. And in places like Anacostiaa walkable, Metro-accessible neighborhood with plenty of retail-ready storefronts and a palpable sense that its time is just around the cornertheres a feeling that dumping more affordable housing there will hold back the inevitable emergence from its current poverty.

  			<p>[...] So with predominantly one- to two-bedroom units, at that income level, I dont know that that would appeal to the low-income demographic in this area. Tuley worries that people original site from outside of the neighborhood still attach a stigma to Anacostia and wont move in, and that with the apartments unfilled, the management may be forced to cut costs by trimming staff or shirking maintenance. At last weeks meeting, several attendees suggested that what Anacostia really needs is rental housing for middle-class professionals. Current residents of the neighborhood who might want to move into the Cedar Hill Flats, as well as people from outside the neighborhood who find that the rents there are cheaper than at comparable places west of the Anacostia River, cant move in if they make above 60 percent of area median income.

  			<p>[...] Some wondered how the guidelines from DHCD had changed so much from the initial 2012 solicitationwhich stated, The Big K Community Advisory Group recommends that the Site include no housingto now, when the project is predominantly residential. Others questioned the scale of the development, arguing that a six-story building would be out of place in low-slung Anacostia. Fuller complained that the renderings of the new building appeared more in character with Columbia Heights than with her historic neighborhood.

  			<p>[...] You think you can come in and give us any kind of bullshit? one man shouted. Stop shucking and jiving us and telling us that were part of this process, said another participant. Greta Fuller, the advisory neighborhood commissioner representing most of Historic Anacostia, stood up before Johnson, the DHCD project manager for the redevelopment, had a chance to begin reading the cards. Why didnt I get to speak for the community? she asked. I think that you blindsiding us with what youre going to do does not help us. Fuller and other audience members then rattled off a list of complaints about the process and the plans for the Big K site, which involve five stories of apartments above ground-floor retail.

But the most property management companies in maryland common complaint concerned the very nature of the housing that Chapman and DHCD were proposing.
