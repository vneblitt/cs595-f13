<h1>Andean Bear Cubs</h1>
<h2>Andean Bear Cub Twins Born</h2>
<p>
Billie Jean gave birth to cubs early in the morning of December 13, 2012. The first cub was born at 12:01 a.m. and the second at 2:02 a.m.  <img src="/admin/images/icons/img_arrowdk.gif" alt="" width="15" height="11" /><a href="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/background.cfm">Read more about Billie Jean, Nikki (the cubs' father), and Andean bears. </a></p>

<h2>September 13, 2013</h2>
<p>Our 9-month-old Andean bear cubs are  growing up! Nicole and Curt spend a lot of time climbing trees, wrestling each  other, and chasing each other about the yard. Nicole is smaller than Curt, but  she&rsquo;s more agile and definitely holds her own in wrestling matches. Playful  activities like these build up muscles, reflexes, and skills they will need as adults&mdash;although  &nbsp;the cubs also set aside plenty of time  for sleeping.</p>
<p>Easygoing Curt prefers to stick close to  mom Billie Jean, though he won&rsquo;t hesitate to exert himself when it comes to  food or toys. Nicole, on the other hand, is inquisitive, independent, and fond  of climbing high into trees. She has started displaying nest-building behavior,  bending and shaping thin tree branches into a nest-like shape where she can  sit. </p>
<p>Once they become more independent from  mom, keepers will begin training the cubs in behaviors that help animal care  staff evaluate their health, including opening their mouth, showing their paws,  and practicing to receive a vaccination. The cubs have learned to tolerate  taking food directly from their keepers and to shift in and out of their den.  They are still nursing from Billie Jean but also enjoy solid foods like  omnivore chow, fruit, and vegetables. Keepers are now weighing all three Andean  bears on a weekly basis, which allows them to monitor the cubs&rsquo; health and diet  as they continue to grow.</p>

<h2>June 11, 2013</h2>
<p>Look who&rsquo;s moving  on up! Andean bear cubs Curt and Nicole have been busy since their debut a  month ago at the Andean bear exhibit. </p>
<p>Both cubs are  perfecting their arboreal skills and now regularly climb up to the very top of  the tree in their yard. (They are also getting back down all on their own.) Mom  Billie Jean made it to the top of the tree recently as well to snack on some  mulberries. The keepers have been coming up with some creative enrichment  activities for the cubs, especially on hot days. Last weekend one of the  keepers used a power washer to spray some water into the yard, and the cubs had  a ball playing in the mist of cool water. The cubs are spending most of their  mornings running around their yard, wrestling and play-fighting. </p>
<p>The cubs are in  their yard every day from 10:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. Keepers call them inside in the  afternoon because they are usually all tuckered out from playing in the yard  all morning and need to nap. They have been responding and coming inside  quickly when keepers open the door to the indoor exhibit. After they come  inside, they nurse from Billie Jean and eat. </p>

Many of you watched Andean bear cubs Curt and Nicole on the den cam as they learned to walk, play, and climb. Now, the cubs are ready for their next adventure&#8212;the outdoor yard! Last Friday, Curt, Nicole, and Billie Jean were shifted to Chaska's old den at the opposite end of the exhibit, to provide them direct access to the large yard they will soon inhabit. Unfortunately, this means the family will no longer be visible on the Andean bear cub live-feed, as their new enclosure is not equipped with a cam. Unlike the giant panda habitat, which received a generous donation from the Ford Motor Company to update the exhibit's existing cam technology, we are unable to outfit both dens and outdoor yards with additional cams at this time due to a lack of resources.
</p>
<p>
Smithsonian's National Zoo staff are ever so grateful for the thoughtful comments and observations many of you have posted on our Facebook wall these past five months as the cubs matured. We appreciate your understanding, and hope those of you in the D.C. area will visit the Zoo this Mother's Day weekend for Curt and Nicole's public debut!
</p>

<img src="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/images/ChaskaPeanut.jpg" width="540" alt="Chaska" />Visit the Andean bear exhibit this weekend and early next week to see Chaska before she leaves for her new home at the Salisbury Zoo on May 1! Chaska was born at the Zoo in 2010. She is the offspring of Billie Jean and Nikki, our male Andean bear who passed away last year. She will continue to serve as an ambassador for her species at her new home.

<p>
Big news: our Andean bear cubs officially have names! Keepers chose the name Nicole for the female cub. They wanted to honor the memory of her father, Nikki, who passed away last August after a year-long battle with cancer. The male cub, Curt, is named in honor of late Zoo Advisory Board Member Curt Winsor.

 Over the next few weeks, keepers will be baby-proofing the yards by adding hay bedding and other elements to make the yard as safe as possible for adventurous baby bears who like to climb. Once animal care staff determine that the family has acclimated to the yard, they'll make their public debut! Unfortunately, the bears' outdoor enclosure is not equipped with a cam. We hope that you'll be able to come to the Zoo and see them in person.

The Andean bear cubs are approximately 11 weeks old, and now the only thing standing between them and their behind-the-scenes indoor enclosure is mom Billie Jean! Previously, when the cubs ventured forth into this area, mom always blocked their way or herded them back. Last Saturday was the first time Billie Jean actually allowed them to explore past the outer den and into the enclosure. In no time, both cubs were exercising their still-developing climbing skills! The cubs are now roughly the same age as Bernardo and Chaska were when Billie Jean first allowed them out of the den. 
</p>
<img src="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/images/ABGirl_1_cropped.jpg" width="540" alt="Female Cub" />
<p>
Billie Jean has been shifting into the adjoining den for keepers so they may clean the enclosure&#8212;a task she tolerates, but isn’t thrilled to accommodate. She’s consuming more food now, so this has become a necessity. Keepers don’t approach the den when the cubs are present, and try to clean as fast as they can. Hopefully, Billie Jean will become even more accustomed to this routine. 
</p>                  
                   
<h2>March 4, 2013</h2>
<p>It's been smooth sailing ever since both Andean bear cubs received a clean bill of health during their first veterinary exam. After the exam, keepers noticed Billie Jean had stopped bringing the cubs out of the den to retrieve fresh bedding materials, however, she resumed doing so yesterday. As a few of you pointed out, Billie Jean was given access to some shredded newspaper to add to her nest, and all three bears seem to enjoy the novel addition to their bedding!</p>
<img src="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/images/BJCub.JPG" width="540" alt="March 4 Update" />
<p>This week, the cubs began to explore the exciting new world that exists outside the inner part of the den, as their mobility and independence grow by the day. You might notice the two of them venturing towards the entrance of the den, climbing over the hay containment board (an ability the cubs have now mastered!), and even exploring other parts of the den that are beyond the cam's range. Billie Jean has not permitted them out into the actual enclosure, yet. Both cubs are also now exploring their capabilities of standing on their hind legs&#8212;which means it won't be too much longer before they’re climbing!</p>                   
                                        
<h2>February 20, 2013</h2>
<p>The cubs have had their first exam, and they both received a clean bill of health today from the Zoo's veterinarians! A team of 14 people including vetrinarians and keepers performed a complete physical exam  on each cub which entails: listening to  the cubs&rsquo; hearts and lungs; checking their mouth, eyes, legs, feet and genital  area; and feeling their bellies. The cubs also received the first in a series  of routine vaccines. Although it is  difficult to determine the sex at such a young age when genitalia have not  fully developed, the cubs appear to be male and female. The larger cub weighs  10.1 pounds; the smaller weighs 9.2 pounds.</p>
<p><img src="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/images/Brannen_2035-edit.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /> </p>
<h2>February 18, 2013</h2>
<p>As cam watchers have probably noticed, Billie Jean is bringing the cubs out of the den more frequently. Sometimes she seems to be in search of food or hay, and sometimes it seems she brings a cub out when one is being particularly noisy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other morning when one of the keepers was getting ready to feed her, she brought a cub out and placed it on the floor. She kept it close while the keeper fed her some food! She took the cub back to the nest was she was finished eating.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hoping to get in to give the cubs their first exam in the next few days. We&rsquo;re working with getting Billie Jean comfortable separating from the cubs. This process involves feeding her some of her favorite food while we open and close one of the doors into her den. We&rsquo;re trying to get her as comfortable as we can hearing the doors open and close and with then being separated from the cubs for a short while. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When we do get an opportunity to go in and examine the cubs, the cam will be turned off. We&rsquo;ll turn it back on later in the day after the exam.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/images/Abbott_8248.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="321" /></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>February 12, 2013</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re  so glad you&rsquo;re enjoying watching our bear cub cams, both Andean and sloth!  We&rsquo;re thrilled to be able to share this experience with you. Very few people  have ever gotten to observe maternal behavior and cub development in these  early weeks and months in the den, so this experience is as exciting for us as  it is for you. We hope you&rsquo;ve been able to follow along on your computer, but  also on your mobile devices using our app. And we so appreciate those of you  who have snapped and shared screenshots with us!</p>
<p>As  you&rsquo;ve probably noticed, as all three cubs are getting larger, they&rsquo;re getting  more mobile. Billie Jean routinely takes her cubs out of the den for small  excursions, and they seem to be trying out their legs. Before long, the cubs  will start to explore beyond their den on their own. Which means we&rsquo;ll be trying to get photos of them, and if we are  successful then we will share them with you! Unfortunately, it also means they won&rsquo;t be as consistently visible on the cams  as they have been.</p>
<p>Several  of you have asked about vet exams. The vet exams all depend on the mother  bears. Billie Jean and Hana each have to feel comfortable being separated from  their cubs for short times in order for animal care staff to conduct the cub  exams. This is even more difficult in Hana&rsquo;s case, as sloth bears cubs ride on  their mothers&rsquo; backs. When we are able to conduct the exams, you can be sure  we&rsquo;ll keep you updated and share all the adorable photos.</p>
<p>We  also hope that, when the cubs begin to go outside this spring, you&rsquo;ll be able  to come to the Zoo and see them in person!</p>
<p class="center"><img src="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/images/Abbott_8241-JPGcropped-JPGadj.jpg" width="500" height="425" alt="Billie Jean and cub" /></p>
<h2>January 27, 2013</h2>
<p>The keepers got another snapshot of Billie Jean carrying the other cub out of the den! (We know it’s the other cub because the two cubs have distinct facial markings.) While we don’t usually know why she leaves the den, or why she brings the cubs with her, this time it was clear to the keepers that she was on a mission to acquire fresh hay, which she uses for bedding. She picked up on cub, carried it out of the nest, through one enclosure to another, put her paws up on a bench and tried to grab some hay one-pawed. That's when the other cub, back in the nest, started hollering. She immediately returned to the nest—without the hay. </p> <p class="center"><img src="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/images/Abbott_8203-JPGone.jpg" alt="Andean bear Billie Jean carrying cub" width="500" height="338" /></p>

<h2>January 25, 2013</h2>
<p>Several  of you have mentioned seeing the daring rat that occasionally pokes its nose  into Billie Jean&rsquo;s den. The Andean bear building is a warm, dry area protected  from the elements, so it is inherently attractive to all sorts of opportunistic  rodents. Because of the way Andean bears eat (browsing and foraging), the  keepers have to leave food scatter around for them. This availability of food  also attracts rats. </p>
<p>Rats are  amazingly smart animals. The Smithsonian&rsquo;s National Zoo studies their  cognition&mdash;something you can learn more about at the Think Tank exhibit.  We have a team of pest management specialists who work diligently with keepers  to reduce and control our visiting rodent population throughout the Zoo.&nbsp; Our pest  management team has actually observed rats outsmarting traps by flinging them  against walls, and then making off with the bait. This particular rat is,  according to the keepers, &ldquo;almost uncatchable.&rdquo; She (they&rsquo;re almost sure it&rsquo;s  female) has avoided all traps set out for her and even managed to breed. They  have removed 10 offspring, but she still manages to elude capture and  occasionally walks casually across Billie Jean&rsquo;s den.</p>
<p>Of  course, much as we admire rats&rsquo; cognitive abilities, we would still prefer them  not to be in with our other animals. However, we refuse to use pesticides in  our exhibits&mdash;and even that might not work completely. The visiting rats certainly provide our pest control team an element of job security! </p>
<p>However,  fortunately, Billie Jean is a 200-pound bear with strong instincts to protect  her cubs. No rat&mdash;however clever or cunning&mdash;poses a serious threat to her or the  cubs.</p>

<h2>January 22, 2013</h2>
<p>The keepers got their first good  look at one of Billie Jean&rsquo;s cubs! She brought the cub out into the main den.  It&rsquo;s natural for her to carry the cubs this way; it&rsquo;s no different from a cat  carrying her kittens by the scruff of the neck. We don&rsquo;t know why she brings  the cubs out every now and then, but this is the  first time she&rsquo;s brought one out while a keeper was there. </p>
<p class="center"><img src="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/images/Abbott_8200-JPGthird-(2).jpg" alt="Andean bear Billie Jean carrying cub" width="500" height="338" /></p>
<h2>January 14, 2013</h2>
<p>Our Andean bear cubs are one month  old today! As you can see from the cams, they&rsquo;re considerably bigger than the  specks they appeared to be when they were born. Big as they are, it will still  be at least another four to six weeks before we&rsquo;re able to give them their  first veterinary exam. </p>
<p>Like you, we&rsquo;re continuing to watch  the cams! Footage like this isn&rsquo;t just cute and entertaining, it&rsquo;s also  scientifically ground-breaking. As far as we know, no human has had the chance  to watch Andean bear cubs the way we&rsquo;re watching these. We&rsquo;re also going  back to review Billie Jean&rsquo;s behavior pre-birth to get a fuller understanding  of her maternal behavior.</p>
<p>For those of you who have asked why  Billie Jean might temporarily take a cub out of the nest and into the main den, we don&rsquo;t  know. There&rsquo;s nothing in the main den (no  additional bedding) that might tempt her there, but we&rsquo;re allowing Billie Jean  to be in charge of mothering her cubs, and she&rsquo;s doing an excellent job.</p>

<h2>January 9, 2013</h2>
<p>Andean bear Billie Jean and her cubs continue to do well! She&rsquo;s slowly starting to eat, though in very small amounts, which is normal. Because Billie Jean is typically so responsive to her human keepers, animal care staff are working hard not to take her attention away from the cubs. The goal is to let her know the keepers are there, to know where her food is, and to get her used to hearing routine noises again. </p>
<p>For now, we&rsquo;re continuing to monitor her by cam, and we hope you are, too! Many of you noted that Billie Jean moves the cubs around quite a bit. This behavior is completely normal for a mother Andean bear.</p>

<h2>December 29, 2012</h2>
<p>Billie Jean and her cubs appear active and   well. The cubs continue to vocalize, and if you listen closely you might   even hear them nursing! Keepers will continue to keep their distance in   order to maintain a den that most closely resembles an environment one would observe in the wild. </p>
<p> Our team of keepers are seeing the same things you are seeing on the Andean bear cam right now. </p>
<p> We encourage you to share your screen shots on our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/2150506@N23/" target="ext">Andean Bear Cam   Cubwatch Flickr group</a>, as every capture of the cubs' development is a   valuable contribution to the Zoo!</p>

<h2>December 20, 2012 </h2>
<p>Today is Day 8, a milestone day for our cubs!   We&rsquo;re very fortunate to have cubs that have survived more than seven days.   Of course, cub mortality is still a risk, but things are looking   encouraging!</p>

<p>Billie Jean got up to leave the den very   briefly yesterday. This screenshot (also captured by Kirsten Bullard)   depicts her right before she left.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/images/20121219-KristenBullard1.jpg" alt="andean bear cub cam screen shot" width="500" height="356" /></p>
<h2>December 17, 2012</h2>
<p>Billie Jean is being an excellent mom as she   was last time. She's beginning to leave the den for short periods. She   was out of the den, briefly, a few hours ago. We&rsquo;ve been leaving her   measured amounts of food and monitoring how much she eats.   So far, she&rsquo;s only eating a little bit which is normal. The cubs are   still vocalizing, and they are beginning to make the trilling   vocalization typical of Andean bear cubs. We&rsquo;re still leaving her alone   and staying away from the den. We want everything to be as close as   possible to the way it would be in the wild. </p>

<h2>December 15, 2012</h2>
<p>Each birth is different, but last time Billie   Jean had cubs, she began leaving the nest briefly (for a few seconds at a   time) on Day 4. When she does, that's a great time to get a glimpse of   the cubs! Keep your eyes on the cam and be sure to<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/2150506@N23/"> share any awesome screen shots </a>with us.</p>
<p> This screenshot is thanks to Flickr user Diane Picturebookz.</p>

<h2>December 14, 2012</h2>
<p>We continue to watch the cam! We&rsquo;re hearing squeaking, the cubs appear to be nursing, and we suspect everything&rsquo;s going well. <br />
</p>
<p>Thanks to Flickr user lilicammy for sharing this screen grab with us. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/2150506@N23/">Share your screen grabs on Flickr! </a></p>

<h2>December 13, 2012</h2>
<p>Everyone's excited about the Andean bear cubs!   If you're like us, you can barely tear your eyes away from the cam to   get work done. If that's you, then we need your help! When you're   watching the cam and you happen to spy an especially cute moment, pause the cam, take a screenshot, and share the photo with us on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/2150506@N23/">Flickr</a>. </p>
<p> For instance, here's what Billie Jean's doing right now: Just sleeping.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="/Animals/Amazonia/AndeanBears/images/121213-BillieJean-screengrab.jpg" alt="andean bear cub cam" width="500" height="400" /></p>
<h2>December 13, 2012</h2>
<p>As far as we can tell from the cams, the two   cubs appear to be doing well and Billie Jean is tending to them. We will   continue to monitor her on the cams, but won&rsquo;t be going in with her or   the cubs.</p>
<p> This first week is critical for cub development; the mortality rate of   Andean bear cubs in their first year is around 40 percent.</p>
