We were fortunate enough to have health insurance through an  employer that covered the cost of 38 surgeries due to his birth defect, a bone marrow transplant to cure the leukemia, wheelchairs, leg braces, many doctor's vists, therapy sessions, etc.  We know firsthand the tremendous expense parents have when faced with the birth of a child with birth defects.  Our son was helped first by the government program, Supplemental Security Income, before he had worked enough to qualify for Social Security Disability  Income.  He has never been able to obtain a full time job because of his physical and learning disabilities, but has worked part-time for many years in minimum wage jobs.  He now qualifies for Medicare which is life-saving for him, since he is uninsurable under current law due to his pre-existing conditions.  The Affordable Health Care Law will now allow those with pre-existing conditions to obtain health insurance.  Although we were fortunate to have healthcare coverage for these many surgeries, we know there are many families with children with disabilities who do not have adequate insurance.  Those who oppose this law need to step into the shoes of those who aren't able to obtain health insurance due to pre-existing conditions.  President Obama stood by his promise to pass the Affordable Health Care Law which will benefit many people, and we with many other families thank him.  He has accomplished many things during his presidency even though he has had tremendous opposition from the Republican party membership. We believe he is leading our country in the right direction on all the major issues facing our country.  &lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;David &amp; Joyce B.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/257\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Joyce B.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/257\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Joyce%20B.%20from%20Mc%20Kinney%2C%20TX%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F257%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_36":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/farm9.staticflickr.com\/8424\/7803010070_65a8a89178_b.jpg\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"Annie Z. from CO\" \/>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"obamacare\" data-story-id=\"36\">56<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Annie Z.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Nederland, CO<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">I am a nurse and a cancer survivor.  When I had the abnormal Pap smear result that ultimately led to my cancer diagnosis, I was 28 years old and a graduate student at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.  I will never forget what my doctor, a fellow in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department,  said to me on the day I came back to the clinic to discuss my abnormal result.  I had suggested that we just watch and wait and repeat the Pap smear in 3 or 6 months, since I had never had an abnormal one before, but Dr. Christian said, &quot;You have good insurance and I think that we should do a biopsy.&quot;  That decision may have saved my life, and it was made based on my insurance status.  After the biopsy and the cancer diagnosis, I went through surgery.  I was 28, and would never be able to have a child.  I was devastated.  In the middle of this time, I got a letter from my insurance company, asking for all of my medical records.  This was the student insurance, for which no pre-existing conditions were supposed to apply.  And I had no pre-existing condition, but now that I had a cancer diagnosis, they were trying to prove that they didn't have to pay!!  A call from the Chancellor of the University put a stop to that, but it was harassment at a time when I did not need it.  No woman should ever have to accept less than the best care because she lacks insurance, and no one should be harassed and denied help when they need it because of a pre-existing condition.  Even today, an insurance company could deny me coverage because of my cancer 16 years ago.  I am fully behind the President's health care plan.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;The photo is of my son Ryan and I finishing this year's &quot;Bolder Boulder&quot; 10K.  We adopted Ryan 2 years after my cancer surgery, which left me unable to have biological children.  He's the best guy in the world, and a huge fan of the President.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/36\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Annie Z.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/36\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Annie%20Z.%20from%20Nederland%2C%20CO%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F36%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_1453":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/twitpic.com\/show\/full\/axbnqp\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\" \/>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"obamacare\" data-story-id=\"1453\">42<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Ryan D.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Saint Petersburg, FL<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">I am a 33 yr old engineer originally from Kansas City and now living in St Petersburg, FL.  The 2008 presidential race was the first time I was truly inspired by a candidate to get involved as I saw the potential of what we could accomplish with Barack Obama as president.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Four years later, I am as inspired as ever because of all that has been accomplished, especially Health Care Reform.  I was diagnosed with cancer in June and have been in treatment for the last two months.  I am a defense contractor and have purchased insurance on the individual market for the last 5 years.  I have only been with my current insurer for 3 years and one thing that helps me sleep easier at night is knowing that I can't be dropped thanks to Obamacare, which is helping not just me but so many like me.  It is also comforting to know if I need to change insurers for work, etc. that I don't have to worry about my pre-existing condition, and at 33 the likelihood of staying with one insurer the rest of my list is pretty low.  There are so many people who are being helped by Health Care Reform and as more people understand about it, the more support will solidify.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/1453\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Ryan D.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/1453\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Ryan%20D.%20from%20Saint%20Petersburg%2C%20FL%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F1453%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_5589":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/distilleryimage4.instagram.com\/681f229e511911e2996722000a9f18fe_7.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Me and My Mom.

This disease combined with her congestive heart failure added other complexities such as water weight gain which made her reach an excess of 200 pounds in water weight. As a result, she acquired edema which made her stomach so big that it dropped below her knees, which prevented her from walking. She wasnt walking for at least 4 months. Once we got her to the right doctor who knew what to do, she began to make a turn for the better. This process in getting the water off however took nearly a year including many months in the hospital, nursing home(which is where she could receive continued physical therapy), and home health care nurses and physical therapists; and all the proper  home health aids: hospital bed, security handles for the restroom and portable restroom.&lt;br \/&gt;If it had not been for the the Affordable Care Act, I dont know how my mother would be today. Because of President Obama's healthcare reform, my mother is strong and healthy. &lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Thank you President Obama for pushing healthcare reform.

He has Down syndrome, seizures, and had a stroke in utero. Before Kory, I had been a civically involved, fully employed, independent woman. Overnight, I became a full-time mother of a child with multiple disabilities and needs. I had to quit my job and start my own part-time business from home. And I would not trade my life now for anything in the world. Because in the midst of all of the stress and trauma, I&rsquo;ve learned what true love is. Yet having a child with disabilities means everything takes longer and there is much more about which to worry. Right now, I need to complete a form to appeal our insurance company&rsquo;s denial for a toileting chair that he needs. But at least I know they will never be able to say we have gone over a lifetime spending cap. And if we ever have to change insurance companies, we can&rsquo;t be denied for a pre-existing condition. Thank you, President Obama, for looking out for those of us who struggle in life.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/1720\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Patty B.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/1720\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Patty%20B.%20from%20Dallas%2C%20TX%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F1720%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_282":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/distilleryimage4.s3.amazonaws.com\/a52ac464bd4d11e1aebc1231381b647a_7.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Grandpa Tom made cinnamon rolls.

Her initial NICU stay came at a cost of over 1.2M! &lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Believe me when I tell you - I'm a bit more than relieved to know birth injuries can no longer be classified &quot;pre-existing&quot; conditions. I could go on, and on but I will leave you with this; because if the Healthcare Reform Act, our daughter is excelling and I, well I can sleep at night, (as much as one can with a 2.5 year old anyway!)&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Many thanks to Obama and team&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;- Beth, Josh and Lexi<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/282\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Beth S.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/282\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Beth%20S.%20from%20Springfield%2C%20IL%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F282%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_187":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/farm8.staticflickr.com\/7108\/7803592666_847e160d6b_z.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Ashwani from MD\" \/>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"obamacare\" data-story-id=\"187\">35<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Ashwani J.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Perry Point, MD<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">As a cancer survivor, a person under the age of 26, a recent college graduate, and an American, Obamacare means the world to me.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;It means that I can no longer be denied coverage due to my pre-existing condition.

I was on my second gynecologist before my six years of symptoms of physical pain, severe cramps, weeks long periods, and severe depression were diagnosed.  By this time, the symptoms were so bad the only way to get rid of them was to have pelvic laparoscopy  to remove the endometriosis growing in multiple layers on my organs and surgery to remove the glands in my vagina.  It is only because of Obamacare that my surgery and office visits were able to happen.  I would have lost my health insurance before I could have the surgery due to my age and graduating college.  If I were not able to have the surgery, I would continue to have debilitating pain and possibly infertility.  My current job does not offer health insurance, but thanks to Obamacare I am able to be covered by my father's insurance.  I continue to have regular gynecological exams as my diagnosis can return at any time.  I am able to afford birth control which slows the development on endometriosis substantially.  I do not take birth control for sex, in fact, I lost my boyfriend because of the pain sex caused before the surgery made intercourse unbearable.  The current debates about denying women preventative coverage, contraception, the right to choose abortion, and cutting funding to Planned Parenthood is going to effect millions.  Republicans may believe birth control is used by women to have sex, but I can prove birth control is also a way to prevent infertility.  Endometriosis does not have a cure, and without preventative coverage I could become infertile and continue having physical debilitating pain.  I am educated.  I am a woman.  I believe in women's healthcare and rights.  I am scared of the current Republican platforms.  I live in Indiana which has become one of the first states to deny Planned Parenthood funding.  I no longer want to live in Indiana, because this was not a decision made by the state or by women.  I want to speak out and make a difference.  I want to thank Obama and Women for Obama.  I owe Obamacare my fertility and a normal life.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/327\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Hayley C.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/327\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Hayley%20C.%20from%20Anderson%2C%20IN%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F327%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_4364":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/twitpic.com\/show\/full\/bdhs2p\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" alt=\"\" \/>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"obamacare\" data-story-id=\"4364\">30<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Mara P.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">La Mesa, CA<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">What the president's reelection meant to me is that my nine-year-old, autistic son, Max, will never be denied health insurance or vital therapies due to the fact that he has a preexisting condition.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/4364\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Mara P.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/4364\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Mara%20P.%20from%20La%20Mesa%2C%20CA%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F4364%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_371":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/farm9.staticflickr.com\/8175\/7918842690_afd03778e7_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" alt=\"Write-a-Thon 009\" \/>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"obamacare\" data-story-id=\"371\">29<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Chantal D.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Glendale, AZ<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">Mr. Obama's presidency has meant so much to me in his first four years. I voted for him in 2008 in my first Presidential election, I was 21 years old. Just 11 days after he took office, my father died, plunging myself and my disabled mother into extreme poverty, at the height of the Recession and unemployment. My mom and I almost lost our home. Eventually I found work, but the questions remained of how I was going to pay for the rest of  my college education (at the time I was a sophomore) and find health insurance for my chronic autoimmune disease.&lt;br \/&gt;This is when Obama being President came in handy. In 2011 his Affordable Care Act prevented Arizona's governor from ending the Medicaid insurance coverage of me and thousands of other childless adults. I would be totally blind without my medication and insurance. The ACA also will prevent insurance companies from discriminating against my pre-existing condition in the future- a condition I've had since I was 20! I feel confident that I will never have to worry about having insurance - all because Obama reformed health care.&lt;br \/&gt;His support of Pell Grants have allowed me and other poor students to get a college education that will lift us out of poverty and give us a bright future. I would literally be a waitress the rest of my life without Pell Grants. Instead, I will graduate next year, and someday work for a non-profit that provides services to the poor.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Obama is a president who understands all Americans - and he especially is an advocate for the poor. I don't want to imagine how much harder my life would be without him. No one should ever have to live without health insurance, or the promise of an accessible college education. Obama represents these ideals.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/371\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Chantal D.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/371\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Chantal%20D.%20from%20Glendale%2C%20AZ%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F371%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_181":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/farm9.staticflickr.com\/8433\/7803594866_94c9e4e0d7_z.jpg\" width=\"432\" height=\"347\" alt=\"Malcolm from MO\" \/>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"obamacare\" data-story-id=\"181\">25<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Malcolm H.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Saint Louis, MO<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">While I had devoted much of my life working in public service, it was not until disaster struck my family that I became politically active. In 2011, my life was forever changed when my father, Jack, was diagnosed with lung cancer. My father had never smoked, and lived a healthy lifestyle, but, being a musician, he did not have health insurance. I had never realized how much not having health insurance inhibits you when you need care; even if you did nothing to create your condition, and even when you want to pay for it yourself. It was then that I realized why President Obama had fought so hard to pass the Affordable Care Act. I realized that in a difficult time, it was the right thing to do: It helped so many Americans, including my family.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;My father passed away in March 2011. He left a legacy of incredible music and political activism. His last few months were made better because of the direct efforts of the President, and it is comforting to know that because of Obamacare, other families will not have to experience the hardship and struggles that we did.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;I support the President not only because of what he has done, but, because of what he energizes others to do. I know America is hurting, I can see it every day. That's why I volunteered with the campaign. It's my way of connecting. By organizing in our neighborhoods and sharing our stories, we can work together to make America a better place for all.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/181\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Malcolm H.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/181\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Malcolm%20H.%20from%20Saint%20Louis%2C%20MO%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F181%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_971":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"obamacare\" data-story-id=\"971\">24<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Phyllis S.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Cleveland, OH<\/h3>\n    <section class=\"full-text\">\n        <p class=\"summary\">\n            The passage of Health Care for Women was a valuable asset for preventive care for females.

My insurance went from $0 to $1,000 deductible and I have to meet a co-insurance amount of $500 for a total of $1,500.  I was already making payments and did not want to add any additional expenses to my bill.  Then I remembered we have Obamacare and I did not have to pay a deductible or co-insurance for a preventive screening.  It was a good asset for me because my preventive screening revealed spots on my left breast and I have to do a retake later this month.

He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He is strong and compassionate and we have been through so much as a couple. See, on January 26th, 2011, Trevor was diagnosed with a brain tumor. After months of headaches, nausea, and blurred vision, he went to see an ophthalmologist. The reason it took so long to get him into the doctor was because he did not have health insurance. The only reason he was able to see the eye doctor was because his mother recently was hired there and they give free eye exams to family. The eye doctor found a swollen optic nerve, and sent Trevor to see a neurologist. The neurologist sent him for an MRI, and within 2 days of his eye appointment he was diagnosed with an orange sized brain tumor. We were not sure what we were going to do because he did not have insurance and was not eligible for medicaid. We found out that through the Affordable Health Care Act, Trevor could be added to his mother's insurance until the age of 26 (he was 22 at the time), even though he was not in school. This saved Trevor's life. His hospital stay and surgery were $100,000, and his monthly medication for the last two years has been around $20,000. He receives MRI scan every 3 months and he had 6 weeks or radiation. With on going doctor appointments, he may have never been able to receive the treatment he needed without the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to Obama and his compassion and drive to expand health care in the United States, i was able to marry my best friend and he is doing great today!<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/252\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Danielle M.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/252\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Danielle%20M.%20from%20Lansing%2C%20MI%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F252%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_1270":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <img src=\"http:\/\/farm9.staticflickr.com\/8459\/8002188012_6efd8073d9_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"224\" alt=\"Photo on 2011-11-14 at 00.45 #2\" \/>\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"obamacare\" data-story-id=\"1270\">19<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Margaret M.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Oceanport, NJ<\/h3>\n    <p class=\"summary\">In June 2011, just a month after my 23rd birthday, I was diagnosed with Non-Hogkins Lymphoma Large B-Cell. This was after nearly 6 months of suffering through misdiagnoses after misdiagnoses. Had President Obama not passed Obamacare into action when he did, I am confident I would be dead right now. I know this sounds harsh but, not a week after they found my cancer I went into partial heart failure and was on death's door step. One of the things that made all of what my family and I have gone through in the last 2 years easy was knowing that I was covered by my parent's healthcare. Had I not, I don't think I would have had the doctors I had and the proceeders that saved my life. I can't fathom what would have happened. I do know that, had I survived, I would be over a million dollars in debt just because I had a cancer that doesn't happen often in young adults. Even now, I worry about whether I'll ever get healthcare and, if I do, will it bankrupt me. &lt;br \/&gt;Mostly I'm telling this story because I am grateful. It makes me so grief-striken when I hear people argue and complain about Obamacare. It's like they're saying they didn't want me to get better when I had cancer. I know President Obama cares about people and that's why Obamacare is important. He cared about me by proxy, and I can only hope that the more I tell my story the more help I can be to keep him in office. &lt;br \/&gt;This October I'll be a year in remission and I know I owe this to many people, one of which is President Obama.<\/p>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/1270\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Margaret M.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/1270\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Margaret%20M.%20from%20Oceanport%2C%20NJ%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F1270%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>","obamacare_6389":"<div class=\"content\">\n    <div class=\"awesome\" data-campaign=\"obamacare\" data-story-id=\"6389\">18<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"name\">Eileen F.<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"location\">Ashburn, VA<\/h3>\n    <section class=\"full-text\">\n        <p class=\"summary\">\n            To some it may seem like a small thing, but for me and my family, it is so important. My husband and I have 4 children, ages 14 - 22. We are so grateful for Obamacare and the fact that our two oldest children --ages 21 and 22 -- are able to stay on our health insurance for several more years. Both of our daughters work part-time jobs in addition to going to school full-time. Expenses are high, and they and we (as parents) are going into debt in order for them to obtain a college education. Our girls wouldn't be able to afford health insurance if they had to purchase it on their own. The fact that they can stay on our health plan during these lean years means so much to us. Thank you, President Obama, for keeping your promise to make health care more available and more affordable!\n        <\/p>\n    <\/section>\n<\/div><nav class=\"sharing\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"facebook\">\n            <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/6389\/\" data-ref=\"fb_like_btn\" data-send=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\" data-width=\"100\" data-show-faces=\"false\"><\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"twitter\">\n            <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-text=\"Read Eileen F.'s story about Obamacare, then read more from Obama supporters all over.\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.barackobama.com\/stories\/obamacare\/6389\/?source=tweet_btn\" data-related=\"BarackObama\">Tweet<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n        <li class=\"email\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:?&amp;subject=You%20should%20read%20this%20story%20about%20Obamacare&amp;body=Hey%20--%0A%20%0AI%20just%20read%20Eileen%20F.%20from%20Ashburn%2C%20VA%E2%80%99s%20story%20about%20Obamacare%20and%20supporting%20President%20Obama.%0A%20%0ACheck%20it%20out%20on%20barackobama.com%20at%202012%20Stories%3A%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fobamacare%2F6389%2F%3Fsource%3Dstories_EMS%0A%20%0AIf%20you%20have%20a%20story%20about%20why%20you%20support%20the%20President%2C%20you%20can%20share%20it%2C%20too.%0A%20%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.barackobama.com%2Fstories%2Fshare-your-story%0A%0AThanks.\" title=\"Share via Email\">Share via Email<\/a>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/nav>"};
